It is the least specific of the four options, primarily being associated with hepatocytes (liver cells) but can also be seen in skeletal muscle. The other enzymes listed, while also liver enzymes, have a higher association with the cytoplasm or nucleus.  So option C, GGT, is correct since it predominantly has a mitochondrial origin.  B and D are not primarily associated with mitochondria; SGOT (AST) and SGNP (ALT) are more commonly found in the cytoplasm while GGT can occur both in the cytoplasm and mitochondria depending on how it reacts with its substrate.
