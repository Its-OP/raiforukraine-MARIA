We will distinguish between acute low back pain of common and mechanical origin and acute low back pain of secondary origin.\n\nThe interview states:\n\nantecedents (neoplastic, infectious, etc.); circumstances of onset (after exertion, lifting, etc.); main site of pain (low back pain, right or left lumbar fossa, etc.) and intensity; pain radiations (iliac fossa, hypogastric region, inguinal fold, etc.); rhythm of pain: mechanical or inflammatory; course of pain (progressive worsening, resistant to medical treatment, etc.); history of low back pain: previous similar episodes, evolution of the pain, etc.).); the rhythm of the pain: mechanical or inflammatory; the course of the pain (progressive worsening, resistant to medical treatment, etc.); the history of low back pain: previous similar episodes with a favourable outcome may be reassuring; the absence of general signs (fever, adenopathy, etc.) or associated signs (nausea/vomiting, micturition problems, paresthesias, etc.).\n\nThe clinical examination looks for :\n\nIf possible, the patient should be standing up, examined in profile and from the back; look for a disorder of spinal statics, an analgesic attitude in relation to the lumbago; look for painful points on palpation of the spine, often with stiffness in the lumbago; look for a cellulo-myalgic syndrome opposite the painful areas; look for sacroiliac, hip and gluteal pain as part of the differential diagnosis.\n\nA neurological examination will rule out radiculalgia or cauda equina. A general and visceral examination will be carried out depending on the associated signs and the context.\n\n==The main urological causes of acute low back pain are:==\n\n*[[Urinary lithiasis|nephritic colic 265]]\n*[[Urinary tract infections in children and adults|acute pyelonephritis 161]]\n\n==Other urological causes of acute low back pain include:==\n\n*renal infarction (emboligenic condition: [[Atrial fibrillation|atrial fibrillation 232]]; [[Monitoring of valve wearers and vascular prostheses|valve wearers 153]], [[Vascular nephropathy|vascular nephropathy 263]])\n*[[Immediate management pre-hospital and on arrival at hospital|renal trauma 334]]\n*[[Genito-scrotal pathology in boys and men|projected testicular pain (torsion, orchi-epididymitis) 50]]\n*[[Polycystic kidney disease|polycystic kidney disease 266]]\n*retroperitoneal fibrosis\n\n==Non-urological causes of acute low back pain include:==\n\n*nephrology: [[Proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome in adults and children|proteinuria 259]], [[Glomerular nephropathy|acute conglomerulonephritis 261]], [[Vascular nephropathy|thrombosis of renal artery stenosis 263]], i[[Acute renal failure - Anuria|acute renal failure 348]].\n*v[[Acute abdominal pain in children and adults|isceral 269]] :\n**mesenteric infarction, [[Acute abdominal pain in children and adults|gastric ulcer 272]], [[Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CIBD) in adults|inflammatory bowel disease 282]]\n**right: [[Biliary lithiasis and complications|cholecystitis 277]], [[Biliary lithiasis and complications|angiocholitis 27]]7, [[Viral hepatitis|hepatitis (167)]], [[Appendicitis in children and adults|acute appendicitis 356]], [[Acute pancreatitis|pancreatitis 358]]\n**left: splenic infarction, [[Acute pancreatitis|pancreatitis 358]], [[Colonic diverticulosis and acute sigmoid diverticulitis|acute diverticulitis 287]]\n*vascular: aortic aneurysm (fissuring, dissection 225 )\n*gynaecological: [[Main complications of pregnancy|ectopic pregnancy 24]] and [[Acute abdominal pain in a pregnant woman|26]], ovarian cyst (cyst), [[Endometriosis|endometriosis 41]]\n*Pulmonary: [[Community-acquired bronchopulmonary infections in adults and children|acute pneumonia 154]], [[Pleural effusion|pleural effusion 206]], [[Pneumothorax|pneumothorax 360]], [[Acute chest pain|acute chest pain 230]], [[Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see item 330)|pulmonary embolism 226]].\n*neurological or spinal:\n*Interrogation (history, trauma, posterior medial or latero-spinal pain, increased by spinal movements, gait disorders) and clinical examination (motor or sensory neurological disorders) should point to a spinal or neurological cause ([[Recent neurological deficit (see item 340)|recent neurological deficit 91]] and [[Cerebrovascular accidents|340]] ; [[Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|motor/sensory deficit of the limbs 92]]; [[Non-traumatic spinal cord compression and cauda equina syndrome|spinal cord compression 93]]; [[Spinal pain|rachialgia 94]] ; [Radiculalgia and canal syndrome|radiculalgia and canal syndrome 95]]; [[Osteoarthritis|arthrosis 129]]; [[Spondyloarthritis|spondylarthritis 197]]; [[Spinal fracture, associated spinal cord injury|spinal fracture]].\n\n\n\n<br />",
