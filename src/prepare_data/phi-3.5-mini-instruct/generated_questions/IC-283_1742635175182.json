In this case, the patient most often describes a reduction in the number of weekly bowel movements, with rather dehydrated stools (small and hard because they remain in the colon for longer).\n\n''If it's distal constipation also known as dyschesia'', it may be :\n\n- a functional disorder (lack of anal sphincter relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter during thrusting, disturbance of rectal sensitivity) and/or\n\n- an \"anatomical\" disorder with a disturbance of pelvic statics (rectocele, descending perineum, internal rectal procidence, etc.)\n\nIn the case of distal constipation, the patient most often describes exaggerated pushing efforts, a feeling of incomplete evacuation and sometimes recourse to digital manoeuvres to encourage evacuation (most often in the case of anatomical disorders).\n\nNB: The two mechanisms of constipation can coexist.\n\n\nB) ''Secondary constipation'': indicative of an organic disease, digestive or extra-digestive, which should be investigated during the interview.\n\nAny recent or recently aggravated constipation should be investigated for an organic cause, primarily colonic stenosis. A medicinal or toxic cause should be systematically sought in patients complaining of recent constipation.\n\n\nThe possible causes of secondary constipation are presented in Table 1.\n\n\nWarning signs :\n\n- changes in general condition, weight loss\n\n- nocturnal and insomniac pain\n\n- rectal bleeding, melena\n\n- severe, persistent constipation that does not respond to treatment or worsens without any obvious cause\n\n- Rectal syndrome (epithelial discharge, tenesmus, false urination)\n\n- abdominal or rectal mass\n\n- biology: anaemia, inflammatory syndrome\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Digestive causes''''\n|Extra digestive causes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n\n\n- Luminal obstruction (colorectal or small bowel cancer)\n\n- Non-tumour stenosis (diverticular, inflammatory, ischaemic)\n\n- Anal stenosis (anal canal cancer, inflammatory stenosis, scarring)\n\n- Extrinsic compression: benign or malignant tumour (e.g. ovary), peritoneal carcinosis, post-surgical adhesions, endometriosis, prolapse, etc.\n<br />\n|\n\n'''Neurological:'''\n\n- Parkinson's disease\n\n- Multiple Sclerosis\n\n- Spinal cord injury\n\n- Ponytail syndrome\n\n- Cerebrovascular accident\n\n\nNB: It is estimated that almost 50% of patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases have transit disorders.\n<br />\n|-\n|\n\n'''Metabolic:''''\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency\n\n- Hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia\n\n- Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia\n<br />\n|-\n|\n\n\n'''System diseases:'''\n\n- Scleroderma\n\n- Amyloidosis\n<br />\n|-\n|'''Drug or toxic causes:''''\n\n- oral iron\n\n- antidiarrhoeals\n\n- analgesics (opiates, tramadol), antispasmodics\n\n- anticholinergics\n\n- antidepressants (carbamazepine), antipsychotics, anticonvulsants (amitriptyline), antiparkinsonian drugs\n\n- hypokalaemic diuretics (furosemide)\n\n- resins (cholestyramine)\n<br />\n|}\n<br />",
