Mammograms are performed at two angles (axillary oblique and frontal), are reimbursed at 100% by the health insurance scheme and are double-read. Screening is legal in the absence of any clinical sign already identified (in which case the diagnosis is already being made).\n\n*For women at high or very high risk: individual screening tailored to their level of risk based on a clinical examination combined with imaging (mammography, ultrasound, breast MRI) is offered.",
