The maximum frequency of hot flushes occurs one to two years after the menopause.\n\nThe duration of symptoms varies greatly from one woman to another, averaging around 7 years, but they can sometimes be observed up to 20 years after the onset of the menopause.\n\nQuestioning and clinical examination are essential to distinguish typical BVM from atypical BVM, which should be investigated for other causes.\n\n==Typical motor flushes===\nTypical motor flushes\n\n- Occurs during the peri-menopause or menopause\n\n- Mainly nocturnal but can also be diurnal\n\n- Most often occur without premonitory signs\n\n- Favoured by emotions and high temperatures\n\n==Atypical hot flushes=\nAtypical hot flushes or motor flushes will be evoked in practice:\n\n- When BVMs ''do not subside with the use of a suitable menopausal hormone treatment'' (compliance and correct use);\n\n- When they \"appear or reappear at a distance from the menopause\";\n\n- When there are ''modifications to the usual BVMs'' ;\n\n- When they are \"associated with other functional signs\" such as headaches, palpitations, \"malaise\", diarrhoea or hypertensive crises.\n\n==Assessment of flushing=\n- Questioning: symptoms, frequency, time of day, duration, intensity, triggering factor (exertion, stress, meals, food or medication), associated signs.\n\n- A clinical examination will rule out fever, high blood pressure, palpitations and poor general condition; an examination of the lungs, abdomen, thyroid gland, neurology, skin and lymph nodes is necessary.\n\n- Complementary examinations based on clinical findings",
