The drop in cardiac output results in hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia, leading to failure of the peripheral organs concerned (kidney, liver, brain).\n\n- The usual clinical definition includes: systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, urine output < 30mL/h or cold extremities, cardiac index < 2.2 l/min/m\u00b2 with capillary pressure > 15 mmHg.\n\n- The leading cause of cardiogenic shock is myocardial infarction",
