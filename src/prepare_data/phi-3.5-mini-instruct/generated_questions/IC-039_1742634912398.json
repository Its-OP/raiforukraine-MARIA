If the couple separates, or if they do not wish to continue with their parental project, they may request that the embryos be destroyed, or that they be transferred to research or to another couple.\n\n<Gamete or embryo donation </u> is carried out in a public or not-for-profit establishment authorised for these activities, mainly in an egg and sperm study and conservation centre (CECOS). This involves the intervention of a third-party donor of spermatozoa or oocytes or a donation of embryos with a view to their reception (preserved as part of IVF-c or ICSI, for which there is no longer a parental project). The couple benefiting from a gamete or embryo donation is referred to as the \"recipient couple\".\n\nThe conditions for access to third-party donor MPA are identical to those for intraconjugal MPA.\n\nThe main principles of the donation are as follows:\n\n*Voluntary'': donation is carried out freely, after the donor has signed a written consent form with the medical team authorised to carry out the donation, and the recipient couple has signed it with a notary.\n*Free of charge'': no payment in return, but expenses incurred by the donation are covered.\n*Anonymity: donors and recipients do not have access to their respective identities. Since the Bioethics Act of 2021, children born from a donation will have the right, when they come of age, to request, if they wish, the identifying and non-identifying data of the donor (sperm, oocytes, embryos).\n\nThe number of children born from the same donor is limited to 10.\n\nDonors may be single or a couple.\n\nDonors are not required to have had children prior to donation.\n\n<u>'''Concerning fertility preservation'''</u>, the '''consent''' of the patient or of the holder of parental authority if the patient is a minor is obtained prior to the gametes or germ tissue being preserved. The consent of both members of the couple is obtained if embryo conservation is envisaged. Every year, he/she is asked whether he/she wishes to continue or stop gamete or germ tissue preservation.  All fertility preservation techniques are currently reimbursed at 100% by the French Assurance Maladie, in accordance with the conditions set out above.\n\n\nIt should be noted that MAP treatment and recourse to fertility preservation are carried out after \"multidisciplinary consultation\" between the doctors and reproductive biologists of the MAP centre carrying out the procedure.\n\n<br />",
