[[Crude or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR), Relative Risk Reduction (RRR), Number needed to treat (NNT) and Crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]]).\n\nRR: ratio of the probability of being ill if exposed to the probability of being ill if not exposed. An RR can be estimated from a randomised controlled trial or an exposed/unexposed cohort study. <u>It cannot be estimated from a case-control study.</u>\n\nOR: Odds ratio of being sick or not sick according to the existence or absence of exposure. It can be interpreted as a relative risk when the endpoint studied is rare in the target population.  An OR can be estimated whatever the study design, <u>including case-control studies</u>.\n\nAs always, estimates of these parameters from a sample must be accompanied by their ''confidence interval''.",
