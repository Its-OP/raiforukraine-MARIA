In this context, retinal localization (fundus examination) and endocarditis (transoesophageal echocardiography) should be systematically sought, and catheters checked. If necessary, removal of an infected catheter should be considered. Examination of the skin can identify cutaneous metastases. Hepatosplenomegaly and/or disturbances in the liver function tests should be investigated for hepatosplenic candidiasis using abdominal imaging combined with biological markers.",
