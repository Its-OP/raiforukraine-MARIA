Beyond 3 months, the value of prolonging anticoagulant treatment depends on the circumstances in which it was given and the benefit/risk ratio between thrombo-embolic recurrence and haemorrhage.\n\nIn practice:\n\n*The duration of treatment for proximal DVT and PE is identical;\n*Proximal DVT or PE ''with a strong identified transient favouring factor'': 3 to 6 months' treatment;\n*Unprovoked\" proximal DVT or PE: at least 6 months' treatment, with prolonged treatment discussed on a case-by-case basis (with no a priori end date);\n*Recurrent proximal DVT or \"unprovoked\" PE: prolonged treatment;\n*Proximal DVT or PE and \"cancer\": treatment as long as the cancer is active (tumour present, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, etc.);\n*Proximal DVT or PE and ''pregnancy'': at least 3 months' treatment, including the first 6 weeks post-partum;\n*PE associated with chronic post-embolic pulmonary heart disease: long-term treatment.\n\nIn all cases, in the event of prolonged treatment, it is essential to regularly re-evaluate the benefit/risk ratio of the treatment between thrombo-embolic recurrence and haemorrhage and to ask the patient's preference with regard to the treatment: adaptation to [[Adaptation of treatments to a particular condition (IR, HI, pregnancy, elderly person...)|particular condition]]: renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy, elderly person...\n\nA follow-up venous Doppler ultrasound is systematically carried out at the end of anticoagulant treatment in order to determine the sequelae. In the event of a painful recurrence, this avoids the conclusion of a thrombotic recurrence if an after-effect on the same venous segment had been noted.\n\n<br />",
