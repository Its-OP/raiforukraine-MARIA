To be familiar with the definition, epidemiology and overall management of benign HPV epithelial tumours (diagnosis, evolution, differential diagnoses, treatment and follow-up).\n|Rubric=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=\n|Order=2}}\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the skin and mucous membranes are very common; in the skin they cause benign epithelial lesions, warts, and in the mucous membranes, condylomas.\n\n\nWarts affect 7 to 10% of the general population, with a peak in frequency between the ages of 10 and 14.\n\n\nCommon clinical aspects of warts :\n\n* Plantar warts: There are 2 anatomo-clinical varieties:\n** myrmecia (HPV1), the most common: deep wart, painful on pressure, single or multiple; circumscribed by a thick keratotic ring partially covering the central region whose keratotic and papillomatous surface is dotted with black dots (thrombosed capillaries).\n** Mosaic warts (HPV2), less common (1/4 of plantar warts): superficial, painless warts in keratotic plaques.\n* Common vulgar warts (HPV2) :\n\nExophytic lesions, surface bristling with greyish keratotic projections, \u00b1 crevices; variable size and number, sometimes confluent.\n\nLocalised mainly on the dorsal surface of the hands and fingers; more rarely palmares or other cutaneous localisations.\n\n* Common flat warts (HPV3).\n\nSmall, barely raised papules, yellow or buff in colour, with a smooth or finely mamelinated surface.  They occur mainly on the face, back of the hands and limbs;\n\nUsually resolves in less than 2 years, but can be chronic in immunocompromised patients.\n\n\nTreatment of warts :\n\n* There is no specific treatment for HPV infections.\n* Patients should be informed that these lesions are benign, that there is a high risk of recurrence and that warts usually regress spontaneously; warts should not therefore be treated aggressively+++.\n\n- Destruction (on request, on a case-by-case basis, depending on experience) using chemical keratolytics (salicylic acid-based preparations with protection of peripheral healthy skin) or physical cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen.",
