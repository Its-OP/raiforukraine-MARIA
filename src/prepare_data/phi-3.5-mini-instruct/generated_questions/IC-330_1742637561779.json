The mechanism of action is glucose-dependent, which means that DDP-4 inhibitors do not stimulate insulin release when blood glucose levels are low.\n* ''''' GLP-1 inhibitors: an analogue of an incretin (GLP-1) that is resistant to DPP-4, enabling it to stimulate the release of insulin and inhibit the release of glucagon from the pancreas.\n* ''''' Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: reduce glucose reabsorption in the renal tubule, facilitating urinary glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis (benefit demonstrated in heart failure).\n\n== '''Indication''' ==\ntype 2 diabetes ([[Drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes SD-281|drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes]])\n\n== '''Adverse reactions''' ==\n\n* Metformin: digestive problems (very common), lactic acidosis (very rare)\n* Sulfonylurea: hypoglycaemia, weight gain\n* DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors: arthralgia (uncommon), pancreatitis (very rare)\n* GLP-1 agonists: digestive disorders (very common), pancreatitis (very rare)\n* Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: urogenital infections (frequent), sometimes serious (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum), arterial hypotension, polyuria, ketoacidosis (rare).\n\n== '''Drug interactions''' ==\n\n* ''''' Metformin:'''''\n\ndrugs likely to promote nephropathy: iodinated contrast products (combination not recommended during the examination and for at least 48 hours after injection), NSAIDs (monitor renal function)\n\ndrugs that inhibit the renal secretion systems of metformin (dolutegravir)\n\n* '''''Sulfonylurea :''''\n\nIncreased risk of hypoglycaemia: miconazole (contraindicated for certain sulphonamides), beta blockers.\n\n* ''''' DiPeptidyl Peptidase -4 (DPP-4) inhibitors :'''''\n\nConverting enzyme inhibitor: increased risk of angioedema (vildagliptin)\n\nNumerous interactions with saxagliptin, which is largely metabolised by CYP 450 3A4, unlike sitagliptin and vildagliptin.\n\n* ''''' GLP-1 agonists''''': low potential for clinically significant interaction\n\n* ''''' ''Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors'':'''\n\ndiuretic (increased risk of hypotension, dehydration)\n\nhypoglycaemic sulphonamide, insulin (increased risk of hypoglycaemia)\n\n== '''Monitoring''' ==\nEfficacy (HbA1c <= individually assessed target) is assessed after 3 to 6 months of treatment, or sooner if treatment is intolerant or clinical signs of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia are present.\n\n== Main causes of failure ==\npoor compliance, progression of the disease, intolerance to the treatment",
