This shows diffuse and homogeneous hyperfixation of the isotope, characteristic of Graves' disease.\n\nThyroid ultrasound-doppler can be useful for diagnosis, as a complement to antibody assays or as an alternative to scintigraphy in the case of pregnancy, showing an overall hypoechoic gland with often diffuse hypervascularisation.",
