Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.\n\n- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics\n\n- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal and cardiac complications.\n<br />\n\n=== '''Indications''' ===\n- Fever: low dose\n\n- Pain:\n\no ''Acute pain'': dental pain, ''postoperative pain'', ''post-traumatic pain'', ''headaches'' or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.\n\no Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.\n\n- inflammation: higher dosage\n\nacute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, ''spinal pain'' and ''radicular pain'' and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.\n\n- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.\n\n\n=== '''Contraindications''' ===\n- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.\n\n- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).\n\n- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).\n\n- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.\n\n- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.\n\n- Haemorrhagic diseases.\n\n- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===\nVirtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's \"terrain\" and any associated medications.\n\n==== 1. Digestive side effects ====\n- frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)\n\n- gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.\n\n- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).\n\nRisk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs\n\n- '''Elderly subject''': age > 65.\n\n- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage or Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\n- Severe co-morbidities.\n\n- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.\n\n- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n- active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis\n<br />\n\n==== 2.    Renal complications ====\n- Acute functional renal failure: especially in elderly patients or those suffering from hypovolaemia.\n\nThe risk factors are :\n\n- treatment with diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists;\n\n- dehydration ;\n\n- dehydrated diet ;\n\n- heart failure.\n\n- High blood pressure due to fluid retention\n\n- Chronic renal failure (chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy)\n<br />\n\n==== 3.    Cardiovascular complications ====\n- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.\n\n- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.\n\n- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n<br />\n\n==== 4.    Allergic complications ====\n- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)\n\n- Bronchospasm\n<br />\n\n==== 5.    Gynaecological and obstetric complications ====\n- Tocolytic activity\n\n- Foetus: premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal failure from the sixth month of pregnancy.\n\n- Reduced fertility\n<br />\n\n==== 6.    Other undesirable effects ====\n- Neurosensory disorders (headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, etc.).\n\n- Cytopenias\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n\n=== '''Precautions for use''' ===\n1.    Personalised assessment of the benefit/risk ratio (taking into account the indication, the patient's condition, co-morbidities and current medication).\n\n2.    Lowest possible dosage (dose-dependent adverse effects) and principles of multimodal analgesia for dose reduction\n\n3.    Prescription as short as possible.\n\n4.    Consider alternatives (paracetamol, corticosteroids), especially in elderly patients or those at risk.\n\n5.    In adolescents, NSAIDs intended for adults can be used from the age of 15.\n\nIn children > 3 to 4 years: ibuprofen and tiaprofenic acid, dose adapted to weight.\n\nIn infants: aspirin, dose to be adapted to weight, avoid if viral infection (flu, chickenpox).\n\n6.    If digestive risk factor: co-prescription of a half-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI).\n\n7.    If ''cardiovascular history'' or cardiovascular risk factors :\n\n- if you have a history of ischaemic heart disease, arterial disease of the lower limbs, a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or congestive heart failure:\n\n- contraindication to coxibs and diclofenac,\n\n- and non-selective NSAIDs not recommended;\n\n- if cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking): NSAIDs prescribed cautiously, only if necessary, with monitoring;\n\n- for patients on antiplatelet therapy :\n\n- the prescription of an NSAID should be avoided,\n\n- if necessary, should not lead to discontinuation of the antiaggregant.\n\n8.    The prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of ''renal insufficiency'', including with topical cutaneous forms.\n\n9.    Avoid NSAIDs in the acute phase of a viral or bacterial infection.\n\n10.  Informing patients of the main risks involved and the risks of self-medication (NSAIDs sold over the counter as analgesics and antipyretics).\n\n11.  Search for possible drug interactions\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Therapeutic class\n|Interactions\n|-\n|NSAIDS\n|Do not combine two NSAIDs, including aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses.\n|-\n|Oral anticoagulant\n|Increased risk of bleeding\n\n- piroxicam and aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses: contraindicated combination\n\n- other NSAIDs: combination not recommended. When this combination is essential, it requires close clinical and even biological monitoring.\n<br />\n|-\n|Platelet antiaggregants\n\n(including aspirin at antiaggregation dose)\n|Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage\n\nPatients taking aspirin at antiplatelet doses should be warned of the risks of self-medication with aspirin or another NSAID.\n|-\n|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants\n|Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage\n|-\n|Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)\n\nDiuretic, angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB II)\n|Risk of acute renal failure in patients at risk (elderly and/or dehydrated patients)\n|-\n|Corticosteroid therapy\n|Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage.\n|-\n|Digoxin, Lithium, Aminoglycosides, High dose methotrexate\n|Decreased renal excretion of the drug (risk of toxicity).\n|-\n| Drugs likely to promote hyperkalaemia (ACE inhibitors, ARB II, heparins, cyclosporine, tacrolimus and trimethoprim, particularly hyperkalaemic diuretics, especially when combined with each other or with potassium salts).\n<br />\n|}\n\n\n=== '''Monitoring procedures''' ===\nregular clinical and biological monitoring in the event of prolonged prescription:\n\n- BP, weight, ''oedema'' if history or cardiovascular or renal risk factors, or anti-hypertensive treatment\n\n- Digestive symptoms\n\n- skin manifestations\n\n- infection: serious infectious pathology should lead to discontinuation of treatment\n\n- biology: haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, liver enzymes, pro-BNP depending on the context",
