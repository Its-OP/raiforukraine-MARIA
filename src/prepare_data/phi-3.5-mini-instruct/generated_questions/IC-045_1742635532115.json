In order of frequency atrioventricular canal (AVC), ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD): know how to look for a [[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|anomaly on cardiac auscultation]]\n\n- Psychomotor retardation\n\n- Intellectual disability\n\n- Sleep disorders with almost 50% obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome\n\n- Digestive malformations: anal imperforation, duodenal stenosis\n\n- Hypoacusis/ Deafness to be detected\n\n- Risk of congenital cataract (1%)\n\n- Attention deficit, impulsivity, intolerance to frustration\n\n- Autism spectrum disorders in 5-10% of patients\n\n- Epilepsy (West syndrome) in 5% of patients\n\n- Recurring ENT infections\n\n- Facial dysmorphia: microcephaly, flat profile; palpebral slits oblique upwards and outwards; small, round ear pavilions; flat neck with excess skin; joint and skin hyperlaxity; brachymesophalangia of the 5<sup>th</sup> fingers: clinodactyly; single transverse palmar crease (2/3 of cases); increased spacing between the first and second toes with wrinkled soles.\n\n- Delayed growth in height and weight\n\n- Flat feet with frequent valgus\n\n- Hyperlaxity with possible C1/C2 instability\n\n- Language delay\n\n\n'''At birth'''\n\nExamination of the newborn\n\n- Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family\n\n- Look for heart disease.\n\n- Assessment of hypotonia\n\n\nContact\n\n- Look for eating difficulties with swallowing problems (oral disorders that may require rehabilitation by a speech therapist).\n\n- Identifying regurgitation (gastro-oesophageal reflux), which is more frequent in infants with trisomy 21\n\n- Ask about transit disorders: [[Constipation SD-001|constipation]] frequent\n\n- Monitoring weight gain: [[Weight and height growth abnormalities SD-026| Weight and height growth retardation]] frequent (often over -2 SD)\n\nScreening\n\n- Hearing loss or deafness (PEAP currently used routinely)\n\n- Congenital cataract, strabismus, nystagmus more frequent in children with trisomy 21 ([[Vision anomaly SD-138|Vision anomaly]])\n\n\n'''In infants'''\n\n- Monitoring diet and growth in height and weight. How to look for coeliac disease\n\n- Breast-feeding possible but often more difficult (oral disorders).\n\n- Search for signs of West syndrome ([[Convulsions SD-120|convulsions]])\n\n\n'''In children'''\n\nAssess the extent of the psychomotor delay ([[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|psychomotor development abnormality]])\n\n- Assess the extent of language delay ([[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]])\n\n- Assess the extent of cognitive delay ([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])\n\n- Suggest hygienic and dietary measures to combat the onset of obesity\n\n- Research into oral disorders\n\n- Screen for otorrhoea (frequent ENT infection), serous otitis\n\n- Look for clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism: prescribe a TSHus and T4l every year ([[Thyroid work-up analysis SD-194|Thyroid work-up analysis]]). If dysthyroidism, ask for an antibody assay (anti-thyroglobulin).\n\n- Look for [[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]] and/or splenomegaly. Signs in favour of acute leukaemia: 10 times more frequent in children with trisomy 21.\n\n- Check the platelet count every year or every 2 years for frequent abnormalities of the haemogram, particularly lymphopenia and thrombocytosis, more rarely thrombocytopenia. It can also be used to diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).\n\n- In the event of neurological signs, a radiological examination should be ordered to look for C1/C2 instability with signs of spinal cord compression (MRI recommended rather than X-rays). Similarly, because of the hyperlaxity, there is a greater risk of valgus flat feet and dislocation of the patellas.\n\n- Look for autism spectrum disorders, which are slightly more common in children with Down's syndrome ([[Behavioural disorders in children and adolescents SD-133|behavioural disorders in children and adolescents]]).\n\n- Knowing how to look for sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia. It is estimated that almost 50% of children with Down's syndrome have obstructive sleep apnoea.\n\n- Children with Down's syndrome are more prone to autoimmune problems: thyroiditis, diabetes, alopecia and hair loss.\n\n\nAt the paraclinical level, prescribe rehabilitation treatments\n\n- Physiotherapy from 2-3 months\n\n- Speech therapy from birth in the case of oral disorders or around 9 months of age\n\n- Psychomotricity around 1-2 years\n\n- Occupational therapy depending on progress\n\n- Psychological follow-up if necessary\n\n\n'''In adulthood'''\n\n- Explaining treatment to disabled patients\n\n- How to look for testicular cancer in men with trisomy 21\n\n- Early ageing\n\n- Increased risk of dementia: know how to look for [[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]\n\n- Episodes of [[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]] earlier than in other people\n\n- Increased risk of epilepsy, which may be a gateway to Alzheimer's disease.\n\n- Men with trisomy 21 have [[Difficulty in procreating SD-033|Significant difficulties in procreating]]. Women can have children.\n\n\nAdministrative and social aspects: Remember to draw up the care protocol and medical certificate for the MDPH.",
