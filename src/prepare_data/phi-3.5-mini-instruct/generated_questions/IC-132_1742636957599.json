Cerebral lesions may be of ischaemic or haemorrhagic origin and may induce mild cognitive impairment (minor TNC) or a dementia syndrome (major TNC).\n\nThere are several types of lesions that can cause cognitive problems:\n\n- multiple infarctions\n\n- multi-lacunar infarctions\n\n- diffuse leukoencephalopathy\n\n- strategic infarction (e.g. thalamus or angular gyrus)\n\n- hypoperfusion\n\n. amyloid angiopathy ...  \n\nThe sudden onset of cognitive impairment, or the classic \"stair-step\", is suggestive but not necessary. In diffuse encephalopathy, particularly lacunar encephalopathy, a progressive onset is observed.\n\nOn clinical examination, there may be focal neurological sequelae (pyramidal syndrome, motor deficit, homonymous lateral hemianopia, etc.) and extra-pyramidal rigidity (if there is vascular damage to the basal ganglia). Cognitive disorders are heterogeneous (dysexecutive, psychomotor slowing, etc.).",
