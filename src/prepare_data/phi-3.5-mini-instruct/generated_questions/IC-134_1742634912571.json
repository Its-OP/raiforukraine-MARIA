present for at least 6 months)\n\n- Cystalgia with clear urine (urinary urgency)\n\n- Temporomandibular joint syndrome\n\n- Primary headaches\n\n- Complex regional pain syndrome type I (algodystrophy)\n\n\n'''<u>Knowing how to explain nociplastic pain to the patient</u>''''\n\n- We explain to patients that it is a \"pain control defect or dysregulation\", a central neurological disorder of the pain pathways, sometimes with an identified contributing factor (physical or psychological trauma), on a pre-existing genetic or psychological background.\n\n- Patients will be told that \"treatment should not be limited to medication,\" but should always combine a physical and psychological approach, whatever the cause or context.\n\n- Once the diagnosis has been made, information should be provided in writing, and \"regular, gentle physical exercise\" should be recommended as a first-line treatment, particularly in cases of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome and temporomaxillary joint syndrome.\n\n\n'''<u>Fibromyalgia</u>''''\n\n- Fibromyalgia (FM) is common (1.6% of the population) and affects women at least twice as often as men.\n\n- It is the ''most frequent chronic diffuse pain pathology'' and one of the most common types of non-disciplinary pain (along with irritable bowel syndrome).\n\n- Many pathologies can mimic and/or be associated with FM (RA, SpA, Lupus, osteoarthritis, small-fibre neuropathy, etc.).\n\n- There are practical questionnaires for screening and diagnosing fibromyalgia, in particular the simple, validated FiRST questionnaire (Table 1).  \n\n- The ACR criteria (revised in 2016) are\n\n- Diffuse pain affecting at least 4 out of 5 areas of the body\n\n- Symptoms for at least 3 months\n\n- Diffuse Pain Index (DPI) (0-19) and Symptom Severity Scale (SS) (0-12): based on the presence and intensity of the following symptoms: fatigue (0-3), waking up without rest (0-3), cognitive impairment (0-3) and, in the last 6 months: headaches (0-1), abdominal pain/cramps (0-1) and depression (0-1).\n\n- The diagnosis is made if the combination of IDD > 7 and SS > 5 or the combination of IDD between 4 and 6 and SS > 9.\n\n- '''Frequent associated somatic symptoms'': asthenia, sleep disorders, tension headaches, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless legs syndrome, urinary urgency M\n\n- Frequent associated ''psychological and cognitive symptoms'': anxiety and depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress, hypervigilance (excessive focus on pain), neuroticism (tendency to express negative emotions), feelings of injustice, inflexible coping strategies, catastrophism, concentration/attention and memory problems, etc.\n\n- '''Complementary examinations must be limited''': CBC platelets, CRP, Ionogram TSH, PTH, Vit D, autoantibodies if clinically indicated, no X-rays\n\n- '''Treatment must be multimodal'': provide the diagnosis and integrate multidisciplinary approaches with the patient's involvement, without giving false hope of magical results\n\n- '''Non-medicinal treatments: to be offered as first-line treatment'': adapted physical activity, cognitive and behavioural approaches (in the case of adjustment difficulties), relaxation/hypnosis/mindfulness meditation techniques, etc.\n\n- Recommended drug treatments similar to those for neuropathic pain: antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs) and antiepileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin, the latter with caution, see below): 30-40% improvement in 40% of patients.\n\n- Level 1 or 2 analgesics: not very effective\n\n- '''Strong opioids, corticoids, benzodiazepines: strongly inadvisable'''\n\n- '''Risk of abuse and misuse for tramadol and pregabalin'''\n\nTable 1: FIRST questionnaire\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Yes\n|No\n|-\n|I have pain all over my body\n<br />\n|\n|\n|-\n|My pains are accompanied by permanent general tiredness\n<br />\n|\n|\n|-\n|My pain feels like burning, electric shocks or cramps.\n|\n|\n|-\n|My pain is accompanied by other abnormal sensations such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness throughout my body.\n|\n|\n|-\n|My pain is accompanied by other health problems such as digestive problems, urinary problems, headaches or restlessness in my legs.\n|\n|\n|-\n|My pain has a major impact on my life: in particular, it affects my sleep, my ability to concentrate and my ability to function in slow motion.\n|\n|\n|}\nA positive response to 5 out of 6 items leads to a diagnosis of fibromyalgia with a sensitivity and specificity of 85%.\n\n''According to Perrot et al Pain 2014''\n\n<br />",
