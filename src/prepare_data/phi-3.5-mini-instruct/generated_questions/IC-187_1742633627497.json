After removal of the occlusive device, the patch test is said to be \"positive\" if there is contact eczema (erythema, vesicles) on the site to which the allergen has been applied.\n\nThe test is said to be irritant, not allergic, when there is not an eczema but a simple erythema (the occlusion favours irritation). This erythema generally disappears within a few hours, as opposed to several days in the case of contact eczema. It is therefore considered \"negative\", as is the strict absence of erythema.",
