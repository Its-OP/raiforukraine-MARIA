May trigger nystagmus (ophthalmological opinion), if no pursuit = ophthalmological opinion to rule out bilateral amblyopia.\n*9 to 15 months: look for amblyopia\n**alternating occlusion to look for a defence reaction (the infant \"defends\" itself when the healthy eye is hidden from it)\n**spinning top sign: an object is moved to the right and left of the infant, if the amblyopic infant turns its head towards the \"sick\" side. Also used to test eye mobility\n**stereoscopic tests (relief vision): Lang test = dots on a plate depicting an object which the child tries to grasp if his stereoscopic vision is correct.\n*After 2 1/2 years: near and distance visual acuity.\n**Object matching method (child points to or names the designated object): search for a refraction problem (Pigassou, Cadet or Rossano Weiss test).\n*After the age of 4\n**Directional tests: e.g. Snellen's E-tests (capital E's of different sizes and with different orientations, the child indicates the orientation of the branches of the E either with an E-shaped object or with his hand (up, down, right, left)).\n**Number and letter tests (Cadet, Monoyer Scale)\n**Examination of colour vision: Babydalton or Ischihara tests. Colour vision should be assessed at least once on entering school [[Fichier:Pigassou.png|n\u00e9ant|vignette|Test de Pigassou]]\n\n[[File:Monoyer Scale.png|neant|vignette|Monoyer Scale]]\n[[File:Ischiara.png|neant|vignette|Test D'Ishiara]]\n<br />\n[[File:Babydalton.png|neant|vignette|Babydalton test]]\n<br /><references />",
