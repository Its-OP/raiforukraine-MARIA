Biological tests are not necessary in cases of acute low back pain of common origin (disco-vertebral or arthrosic origin of the pain). The situation is different if a symptomatic (or secondary) cause or visceral pain is suspected.\n\n==Biological tests should be ordered as a matter of urgency if there is any sign of seriousness, and should be adapted to the diagnostic orientation:==\n\n*urological\n*nephrological\n*visceral\n*vascular and cardiological\n*gynaecological\n*pulmonary\n*neurological\n\n*In most cases, the biological work-up will include : CBC, creatininemia, blood ionogram, CRP, calcemia.\n*Depending on the circumstances, the biological work-up may also include: blood cultures, ECBU, arterial blood gas, blood group, cardiac enzymes (troponin), D-dimer, inflammatory work-up, proteinuria, pregnancy test, etc.\n*In the event of a cardiovascular or pulmonary referral, an ECG should be performed.\n*If the patient is neurologically oriented, an EMG or lumbar puncture may be requested.",
