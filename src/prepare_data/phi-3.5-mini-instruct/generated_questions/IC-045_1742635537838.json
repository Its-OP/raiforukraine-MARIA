If there is an abnormality on ultrasound, a foetal karyotype will be prescribed. The main signs are as follows:\n\nIn the 1st trimester: neck greater than 3.5 mm;\n\nIn the 2nd trimester: heart disease, hypoplasia or aplasia of the nasal bones, short femurs, indirect signs of duodenal stenosis... ;\n\nIn the 3rd trimester: intrauterine growth retardation with no placental cause, heart disease.",
