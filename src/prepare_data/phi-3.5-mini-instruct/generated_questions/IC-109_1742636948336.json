If MRI is not indicated, a CT scan and angioscan of the polygon of Willis should be performed.\n\nIn the event of non-acute symptoms, a cerebral MRI may be suggested initially in order to rule out chronic adult hydrocephalus, an evolving intracranial lesion process or an acute/chronic subdural haematoma.\n\nIn the context of Parkinsonian syndromes, brain imaging is unnecessary when the clinical picture is typically suggestive of Parkinson's disease.
