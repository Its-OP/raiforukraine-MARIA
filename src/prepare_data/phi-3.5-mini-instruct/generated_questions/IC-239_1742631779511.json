It most often begins in adolescence (essential acrocyanosis, which represents the vast majority of acrocyanoses). It is more common in people of light build. It most often affects both hands and feet, symmetrically.\n\n'''Frostbite''' is characterised by oedematous, pruritic and sometimes allergic, erythrocyanotic papules, usually bilateral (toes, more rarely fingers), which occur when the skin is cold and damp. The pruritic nature ('''''[[Pruritus SD-088|pruritus]]''''') is particularly suggestive, and localised digital oedema is often associated ('''''[[Localised or diffuse oedema SDD-054|SD-54: localised oedema]]'')'''. The disease progresses by flare-ups lasting 2 to 3 weeks with spontaneous recovery in spring and possible seasonal relapses. It may be complicated by haemorrhagic bullae ( '''''[[Bullae, bullous eruption SD-082|bullae, bullous eruption]]'')''' and exulcerations. The first symptoms usually appear in adolescence and are predominantly female. There are no visceral or biological manifestations.\n\nThe picture of <nowiki/>'''digital ischemia''' is that of a cyanic or white finger (or toe) or fingertip or toe ( '''''[[Color abnormalities of the extremities SD-015|color abnormalities of the extremities]]'')''', cold, painful. The picture may also be one of ulceration of the digital pulp ('''''[[Cutaneous ulcer SD-092|cutaneous ulcer]]'')''' or of digital necrosis with a gangrenous appearance ('''''[[Colour anomaly of the extremities SDD 15|bubbles, bullous eruption]])'''''",
