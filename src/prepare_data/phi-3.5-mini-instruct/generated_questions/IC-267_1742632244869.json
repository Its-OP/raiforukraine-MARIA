If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:\n****adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).\n****If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/d orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.\n****In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles (\"tea and toast\" syndrome), water restriction and/or increased osmole intake (animal proteins, NaCl) are generally sufficient.\n***In cases of associated extracellular hyperhydration: sodium restriction and loop diuretics.\n\n*Rate of correction: in these cases, the rate of correction of hyponatremia ''must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours'' (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).\n*In emergency cases of severe hyponatraemia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O), whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:\n**Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.\n**NaCl 9 \u2030 (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natraemia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e. \u2264 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.\n**Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.\n**In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.\n**Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natraemia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).",
