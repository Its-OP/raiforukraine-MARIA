A BU is not intended to formally confirm or rule out a UTI; the clinic takes precedence!\n*It should only be carried out in patients with suspected community-acquired UTI. In the case of a UTI associated with care or the use of indwelling endo-urinary equipment, the BU is of no value and should not be carried out.'''\n*Check the expiry date of the BU.\n*Check that the patient is not taking any medication that could interfere with the BU reagents (certain antibiotics, vitamin C, phenazopyridine).\n*Check that the patient's diet provides an adequate supply of nitrates.\n\n<br />\n\n*Leukocyturia, haematuria or the presence of nitrites may point to a UTI, depending on the clinical context.\n**Leukocyturia and haematuria are almost systematic in the presence of endo-urinary material, which is why the BU is not used in these cases.\n**The presence of nitrites requires the presence of nitrates (supplied by the diet) and bacteria carrying a nitrate reductase (enterobacteria) which breaks down nitrates into nitrites.\n\n== It is important to remember that the PPV and NPV of a diagnostic test are dependent on the prevalence of the disease. In studies, the BU has been widely misused and should be used and interpreted as follows: ==\n\n*In the case of a symptomatic patient (male or female), the PPV is excellent (but in the end the BU merely confirms what a clinical examination has already diagnosed). '''The NPV in this case has no value and should not be used to rule out the diagnosis of UTI'''\n**'''In the case of an asymptomatic patient'' (male or female), it is the NPV that is excellent (but the BU merely confirms what was already known, since the patient is symptom-free).\n**Its value is therefore extremely limited and its interpretation must be made with great care.\n\n<br />\n\n*Similarly, populations (diabetics, elderly patients, etc.) at risk of urinary colonisation (or asymptomatic bacteriuria) will frequently have a positive BU, which should not point to a UTI unless the clinical context is suggestive.",
