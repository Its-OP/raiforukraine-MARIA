The complex cooperation of these different means explains why the slightest malfunction is the cause of venous return anomalies, expressed clinically by signs of chronic venous insufficiency and by the dilation of superficial veins known as varicose veins.\n\n== Deep venous network, superficial venous network ==\nThere are 2 venous networks in the lower limbs:\n\n*the deep venous network: drains 90% of venous blood;\n*the superficial venous network (essentially the greater saphenous vein VGS and lesser saphenous vein VPS), which handles the remaining 10% of venous blood;\n*these 2 networks, separated by the superficial muscular aponeuroses, are connected by perforating veins.\n\nThese data can be found in the CEAP classification (\"A\" for anatomy)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''CEAP classification of DVI''''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''A: for anatomical distribution according to area of interest'''\n\n(these lesions may affect one or more sectors)\n|-\n|S\n|Superficial\n|-\n|D\n|Deep\n|-\n|P\n|Perforante\n|}\n\n== Venous reflux or venous obstruction ==\nVenous insufficiency is linked either to venous reflux or to venous obstruction following deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see item 330). The 2 mechanisms may be isolated or associated. These pathophysiological mechanisms (\"P\" for pathophysiology, see table) are included in the CEAP classification.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''CEAP classification of DVI''''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''P: for pathophysiological mechanism'''\n|-\n|R\n|Reflux\n|-\n|O\n|Obstruction\n|}\n\n== Venous return\nVenous return from the lower limbs takes place against orthostatic pressure due to gravity.\n\nThe factors of venous return are :\n\n-left ventricular perfusion pressure (residual capillary pressure is higher than DO pressure)\n\n-atrial depression and diaphragmatic movements which cause venous blood to be drawn into the OD\n\n-the venom-muscular pump of the lower limbs",
