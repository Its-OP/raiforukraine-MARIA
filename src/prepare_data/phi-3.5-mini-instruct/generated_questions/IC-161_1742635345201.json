Old symptoms are very rarely of infectious origin '''even if bacteriuria is demonstrated'''\n*The most frequent symptoms of the lower urinary tract (forget the term \"urinary incontinence and micturition disorders in adults and the elderly|urinary functional signs 125]\") are those of the filling phase:\n**pollakiuria\n**urinary urgency\n**incontinence sometimes\n*Dysuria is sometimes noted, but this is related to pollakiuria (the patient \"forces an empty bladder\" because the need is felt).\n*The main symptom = urinary burning\n*Other frequent symptoms: discreet [[Haematuria|haematuria 260]], pyuria, bladder tenesmus with pelvic pain/weight at the end of micturition.\n*On the other hand, these symptoms are the only way of expressing a \"bladder disorder\". Many pathologies (idiopathic overactive bladder, bladder tumour, etc.) manifest themselves in the same way. It is often a careful history that helps to distinguish between a recent and an old event.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Remember that the evolution of simple cystitis is not pyelonephritis!</u>''''\n\n<br />\n\n*In the absence of any anatomical or functional abnormality, cystitis does not become pyelonephritis (hence the classification of cystitis at risk of complications). This rare complication accounts for less than 1% of cystitis cases. This explains why the clinical presentation of ANP is febrile back pain without any lower urinary tract symptoms.",
