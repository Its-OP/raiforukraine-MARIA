At the same time, the concept was incorporated into the Criminal Code, providing special protection for certain victims on the basis of physical and psychological criteria (such as age, illness or infirmity), as well as economic and social criteria (such as dependence due to extreme hardship) specific to the victim. Today, it is all the more widely used, including in politics and the media, and as a result helps to shape our relationship with others and the world.\n\nLike the concepts of risk and precariousness, with which it is often associated, the notion of vulnerability has become an essential part of the humanities and social sciences for understanding people in their social and psychological experience, and the world in which they live, which is considered to be increasingly vulnerable. In today's increasingly high-tech societies, where disasters are already part of our reality, our vulnerability is intensified by the ambivalence between our heightened awareness of risks and the impossibility of controlling them all, whereas since the 19th century, thanks in particular to the development of medicine and social protection systems, we thought we were in a position to deal with the 'problem' of our vulnerability [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\n\n'''Two definitions of vulnerability, to be considered together:'''\n\nIn the human and social sciences, there are two main definitions of vulnerability:\n\n- Vulnerability as a constituent of human existence, universally shared, sometimes qualified as fundamental or ontological vulnerability, and which refers to our anthropological and biological fragility. A human existence affected by illness, loss and distress.\n\n- Vulnerability is dependent on particular historical and social contexts, and is often referred to as social vulnerability. It is the subject of a great deal of work in sociology, which identifies multiple vulnerabilities that affect different realities or populations in given socio-historical configurations. It concerns groups or individuals who are considered to be vulnerable because they have few economic resources, a very precarious employment status, a lack of social support or networks, or obstacles to social integration (isolated elderly people, people who are unemployed, people with precarious employment contracts, people with physical or mental disabilities, people without qualifications, people who do not have access to certain rights, etc.). However, care must be taken not to reduce these groups and individuals to their vulnerability, at the risk of turning them into a stigmatising category. All the more so as this vulnerability, like the notion of precariousness, can have a negative social connotation and be perceived as the responsibility of the individuals themselves, who would also be a burden on others through the assistance measures put in place by society and from which they may benefit. Sociologist Serge Paugam, using the concept of social disqualification, looks at the experiences and views of people living in precarious and poor conditions, whose social status is devalued and who feel a humiliation that often forces them to isolate themselves [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote3sym|<sup>3</sup>]].\n\nSocial vulnerability is also considered in a more dynamic way, as the effect of a recent historical process of undermining the wage-earning system and the move towards more globalised capitalism. The society of the twentieth century, characterised by a solid wage-earning condition (guaranteeing social rights, lasting protection against the hazards of life, social independence and integration, and membership of work collectives), is crumbling to the benefit of decollectivisation and re-individualisation, as well as a neo-liberal discourse that appeals to the imperatives of responsibility, initiative and autonomy. Individuals who do not have, or who have only limited social and economic resources, experience downgrading, dependence on social assistance, low self-esteem and permanent insecurity: \"individuals by default\" who lack the real possibility of being individuals [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote4sym|<sup>4</sup>]]. Robert Castel introduces the term disaffiliation, which has a dynamic logic, to understand the trajectory, in successive stages, of vulnerable groups and individuals (job insecurity; unemployment; then long-term unemployment, with a gradual disintegration of social relations). This new society, which is shaking up the whole social structure, is producing a vulnerability experienced by more and more people (inability to plan ahead and control the future, which requires stability in the present, uncertainty and constant fear of loss, feelings of powerlessness, lack of recognition: all factors which help to explain why these people pay less attention to their health, have less recourse to preventive examinations and find it more difficult to consult socially integrated and recognised health professionals).\n\nWhile fundamental vulnerability and social vulnerability are often dissociated, many authors, including Robert Castel, invite us to think of them together, considering vulnerability as both a universal condition and a potential that can affect everyone, individually, in a different or unequal way due to its relational and contextual dimensions, dimensions on which it is possible to act to reduce it, also making reversibility one of its characteristics. For Castel, we must seek to \"establish a system of strict correspondences between what a social subject experiences in the depths of his personal experience and the conditions imposed on him by his historical period and his social position. Not in order to reduce individual subjectivity to objective determinations, but on the contrary to show that the burdens of history and social constraints are internalised by the subjects that we are, to the point of constituting the fabric of our most personal affects\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote5sym|<sup>5</sup>]].\n\n'''The ethics of care''''' :\n\nVulnerability is at the heart of care ethics, which have highlighted the epistemological, ethical and political issues involved in the mobilisation and use of this concept. Care\" thinking emerged in the United States in the 1970s, with the seminal work of Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote6sym|<sup>6</sup>]]. It became established in France in the 2000s, where the choice was made to retain the Anglo-Saxon term, which refers to a network of meanings not found in a single French term. For Vanessa Nurock, translating the notion of care as \"soin\" or \"sollicitude\" is insufficient, and even erroneous, because it misses what makes care original, namely a novel combination of things that are found elsewhere separately: \"Care refers simultaneously to a feeling (solicitude), to sensitivity, to an activity (lavishing attention or care), to a position (taking to heart), to a relationship with the other (active altruism) and with oneself (without abnegation). This is why the main translations used to characterise \"care\" as \"ethics of solicitude\" or \"ethics of care\" are not sufficient, particularly because they place \"care\" either on the side of an ethical attitude (solicitude) or on the side of a concrete activity (care). But 'care' is precisely both an attitude and an activity\". Vanessa Nurock adds that \"one of the ways to account for the thought of 'care' is perhaps to make explicit what it is not, what it reacts to, to see 'care' as the negation of its negation: the opposite of 'I don't care', i.e. 'I don't care', or 'I don't concern myself with it', or it doesn't concern me\". The ethic of care is defined as a reaction to invisibilisation and indifference [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote7sym|<sup>7</sup>]].\n\nSo care is not just an ethical attitude in the intimate relationship between two people, it also has a public and political dimension: the ethics of care make demands, because it calls into question a hierarchy based on male domination that has long devalued care, reducing it to the care and concern for children and elderly parents provided exclusively by women and referring to charity and sacrifice.  \n\nSeveral notions are fundamental to care thinking. People must be understood in their singularity (the healthcare professional must hear and consider multiple points of view, specific to each person, and sometimes quite different from his or her own) and in their relationships. The care ethic emphasises what links people together, their dependencies and their interdependencies: \"the care ethic is an approach that assumes our interconnectedness with others, relationships of dependency, without promoting sacrifice and self-denial\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote8sym|<sup>8</sup>]]. These relationships of care and dependence must be extended to institutions, by looking at how we care for others through the institutions that link us (medicine being practised within institutions) and how we care for these institutions [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote9sym|<sup>9</sup>]].\n\nThe ethics of \"care\" remind us that dependence and vulnerability concern everyone and are experienced in varying circumstances and to varying degrees, since the human condition is by nature based on links of interdependence. They criticise the way our world is structured around the myth of autonomy, or at least a certain conception of autonomy, that of the rational subject who is master of his own destiny and life, the entrepreneur of his own existence and free, because he is capable of deciding for himself by using his reason and expressing his will.\n\nHowever, they do not consider vulnerability to be a defect or a lack of autonomy, even though it is commonly associated, in current representations, with dependence or loss of autonomy, i.e. a state or situation against which it is necessary to protect oneself or take action in order not to lose or regain the status of an autonomous subject, and if the subject is unable to take action because he or she is too vulnerable, it is necessary to do so in his or her place. If vulnerability is misunderstood, it can be used to justify paternalistic public policies and care and intervention measures for groups designated as vulnerable, at the risk of stigmatising them. In the name of benevolence, we multiply the categories of vulnerable people (children, patients, the elderly, disadvantaged groups, etc.) to make them the targets of policies that often mask the relationships of domination and relegation of those who embody the vulnerability we are trying to distance, master and control. It is the same human being who is both autonomous and vulnerable, according to Paul Ric\u0153ur [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote10sym|<sup>10</sup>]]. So vulnerability is not a negative condition in that it prevents or hinders autonomy, but the normal condition of living beings, the common ground of our humanity rethought in terms of weakness and dependence. In this way, a new paradigm is developing that challenges an anthropology that draws on the register of risk, control and power, and for which vulnerability is a problem, a failure or the mark of powerlessness. It is based on an anthropology that sees human beings as both capable and vulnerable, autonomous and vulnerable.\n\n'''Vulnerability in medicine:''''\n\nIn medicine and in the field of medical ethics, the notion of vulnerability is immediately associated with illness. This is because it alters the general state of the person who has to cope with the intrusion of medical examinations, overcome the upheaval associated with the announcement of the diagnosis, accept the treatments and their consequences, assume the injunction to autonomy, i.e. to be a 'good patient' who is informed, consents and co-decides on his or her care, while enduring the physical pain and moral suffering associated with the disease.\n\nThus, medical practice, at least until recently and to some extent still today, is part of a tradition of caring for individuals made vulnerable by illness, within the framework of a doctor-patient relationship conceived as profoundly asymmetrical, hence the development of and criticism levelled at so-called \"paternalistic\" medicine, which treats patients as if they were children or people incapable of exercising their rights normally and needing to be protected and helped by professionals with the necessary skills and the ability to make the right decisions.\n\nAlthough medical paternalism is largely a thing of the past, the fact remains that doctors are regularly confronted with situations where their patients do not seem to be able to exercise their rights and assert their autonomy. In fact, certain pathological conditions seem to deprive patients of any ability to reason or express their wishes: intense pain, withdrawal caused by certain addictions, extremely diminished and very weak patients, patients in chronic neurovegetative coma, certain dementias or pauci-relational states, certain end-of-life situations or serious chronic illnesses, etc. In these situations, the decision as to what should be done should be delegated to the medical team and/or relatives, in the patient's interest, and if recovery is a possible goal, until the patient can regain a decision-making role. The delegation of decision-making is therefore provisional, the aim being to put an end to the condition that has led to decisions being taken in the patient's place, where possible. Obviously, certain more complex situations do not allow the patient's decision-making role to be restored, but require the patient's support to be considered in the light of his or her wishes - when these are known through advance directives or the testimony of relatives - without it being possible to update them.\n\nHowever, vulnerability is not simply the mark of an inability to be autonomous that concerns only others. One of the contributions of the ethics of 'care' is to have reversed the meaning of the term, making it into a more positive vision of a relational capacity or disposition, in this case essential in the care relationship. What is often overlooked, or even 'unthought of' according to Agatha Zielinski, is the vulnerability of the carer and the fact that the caring relationship is first and foremost an encounter between two vulnerabilities, Common representations and expressions such as 'taking charge' of the patient suggest that there is only one vulnerable being in this relationship - the patient, whose existence is reduced to the condition of being sick, exposed to illness, pain and suffering, even death, but also to the intrusion of care and the action of carers. But the carer is also vulnerable in that he or she is exposed to and affected by the patient's suffering, placing the care relationship within a reciprocal and intersubjective framework that underpins its ethical dimension and leads the carer, assigned responsibility, to act to relieve suffering: this is the object of solicitude.\n\nBut the carer's concern is not just about meeting the needs of the suffering and incapacitated patient, it is also about considering the patient as a capable subject, \"always capable - and in this sense, always worthy of esteem\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote11sym|<sup>11</sup>]], and calling on their resources, desires and willpower so that they remain an active subject in the face of illness and not just a victim of it.\n\n\n[[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text is a revised version of Grandazzi G., \"Du risque au fondement du soin : r\u00e9flexions sur la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''Regards humanistes sur le droit, M\u00e9langes en l'honneur de la Professeure Annick Batteur'', Paris, LGDJ, Lextenso \u00e9ditions , 2021, pp. 143-153.\n\n[[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2anc|2]] Brodiez-Dolino A, \"Le concept de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''La Vie des id\u00e9es'', online 11 February 2016.
