The urinary microbiota may change depending on the clinical situation, without this being a warning sign. The ECBU is an examination that does not reveal all the bacteria present in urine, which explains why urine has been called \"sterile\" for decades. However, modern DNA detection techniques have made it possible to identify a urinary microbiota that overturns this dogma.",
