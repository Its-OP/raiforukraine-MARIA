One or more long-term consultations are often necessary. Questioning of the parents and the child should look for:==\n\n*the signs of urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly (urinary function tests 125) (pollakiuria, urgency, the existence of daytime leaks when not urinating and/or nocturnal leaks) with the date of onset of the problems and the notion of urinary infection\n*how and at what age the child learnt to be toilet trained\n*the child's psychomotor and statural development, living habits, daily water intake, schooling and leisure activities\n*any use of protection and the psychosocial impact of bladder weakness\n*any history of functional problems in the parents or siblings\n*notions of malformative uropathy\n*abdominal pain and anorectal problems\n*the existence of psychiatric disorders (ADHD), developmental disorders, sleep and obstructive disorders, and the family context in which the child is growing up.\n\n==This will enable us to rule out the main differential diagnoses, namely:==\n\n*In girls, vaginal micturition, which manifests itself as urine leakage often after micturition, without micturition problems. Vaginal micturition is associated with an inappropriate micturition position.\n*Isolated urinary incontinence with laughter\n*Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|stress incontinence 125]]: urinary leakage during physical exercise or when coughing or sneezing.\n\n==The clinical examination begins with an inspection of the panties/underwear for signs of urine leakage or soiling, followed by a search for a bladder globe. The following tests should be carried out:==\n\n*Examination of the external genitalia (genital-scrotal pathology in boys and men|appearance of the penis 50], abnormality of the vulva, irritation of the genitals and vulva).\n*Observation of urination, if possible, is informative.\n*Abdominal palpation to look for stercoral congestion and a bladder globe.\n*Complete neurological examination (motor skills of the lower limbs and perineal sensitivity) and search for skin stigmata in the lumbosacral region, sometimes discreet, in favour of a spinal dysraphism.\n*Neuro-orthopaedic examination (hollow foot, unequal length of lower limbs, scoliosis, trophic disorders in favour of an associated neurological pathology).\n\n*A 48-hour voiding diary is a simple and highly informative tool, which complements the interview and enables pollakiuria to be confirmed and quantified, and the severity of urinary incontinence 125 to be assessed. Its purpose is to record the frequency of micturition, the volume urinated (in ml) and the existence of urine leakage. It is very useful for characterising the bladder-sphincter behaviour of children, differentiating pollakiuria from polyuria and assessing the extent of urine leakage.\n\n<br />",
