It includes support for the family's \"bereavement\":\n\n*<Group 6: Members of a family who have lost a child unexpectedly as a result of illness, a situation caused by an external cause or a loss during the perinatal period. E.g.: trauma, stillbirths, abortions.\n\n===='''<u>2-Integrated, non-sequential approach</u>.'''====\n''Early palliative care'' may be concomitant with any curative care. In all cases, it involves active management.               '''It is the intensity and objective of the treatments that are discussed.'''\n\n===='''<u>3-Graduated organisation</u>'''''.====\nFor complex situations, frontline teams, can call on, '''regional paediatric palliative care resource teams''' (ERRSPP) or paediatric EMSP mobile palliative care teams; including at home.\n\n===='''<u>4-A triangulation child - parents - carers</u>'''====\nIntegrate the coexistence of '''parental competence and vulnerability.'''\n\n====<u>'''5-Three perinatal situations:'''</u>====\n<u>Antenatal</u>\n\n*Extreme prematurity at the limits of viability :\n\nhigh risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly neurological.\n\n'''<22SA and/or <500g'' : foetus (antenatal) / newborn (after birth) said to be '''non-viable'''.\n\n<24SA: Most French teams do not resuscitate\n\nbetween 24 and 26 weeks' gestation: on a case-by-case basis\n\nThe parents' wishes, informed of the severity of the prognosis, are an important factor in the decision.\n\n*incurable and particularly serious genetic diseases and malformations.\n\nAfter antenatal diagnosis, if the parents wish to continue the pregnancy and do not request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG). Uncertainty is often at its greatest. There is the possibility of foetal death in utero, death at birth, or a life of unpredictable duration, very short or prolonged over months or years with a severe disability. Thinking about all these possibilities at the same time: psychological violence for the parents.\n\nInformation for parents, diagnostic reassessment at birth.\n\nWhen in doubt, intensive management of organ failure will be initiated. In some cases, resuscitation on standby and urgent collegial consultation are necessary.\n\n\n<u>Post-natal</u>\n\n*Neonatal resuscitation situations with therapeutic impasse or diagnosis of particularly serious neurological lesions (extreme prematurity or severe perinatal anoxia). '''The question arises of a decision to ''limit or stop'' treatment''''' '''by collegial procedure''' in accordance with the ''Clayes-Leonetti law''. [Unreasonable obstinacy and limitation.

Draw on the concepts developed by \"developmental care\". Parents will be involved according to their wishes.\n\n'''''Hetero-evaluation''''' via the '''NFCS Neonatal Face Coding System, EDIN''' scales (Newborn Pain and Discomfort Scale).
