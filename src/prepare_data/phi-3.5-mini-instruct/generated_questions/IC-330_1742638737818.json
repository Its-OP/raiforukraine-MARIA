Some \u03b2-blockers have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, enabling them to limit their bradycardia-inducing effect at rest and the risk of aggravating Raynaud's phenomenon.'''''\n\n===''Systemic route'''===\n\n====Cardioselective beta-blockers====\n\n=====Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====\n''Atenolol; Atenolol; Betaxolol; Bisoprolol; Metoprolol; Esmolol; Nebivolol''\n\n=====Avec intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====\n''Acebutolol; Celiprolol''\n\n====Non-cardioselective beta-blockers====\n\n=====Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====\n''Propranolol; Nadolol; Sotalol*; Tertatolol; Timolol; Labetalol; Carvedilol''\n\n=====Avec intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====\n''Oxyprenolol; Kareolol; Pindolol''\n\n====''Eye drops (antiglaucoma)'''====\n''Betaxolol; Karteolol; Metipranolol; Timolol; Levobunolol''\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> sotalol is a particular non-selective \u03b2-blocker, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inhibiting IKr and lengthening the QT interval. It is used as an antiarrhythmic.\n\n==Indications==\n\n==='''''Cardiovascular'''''===\n\n*Angina, myocardial infarction\n*Atrial and ventricular rhythm disorders\n*Heart failure: for metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol. Treatment is started at a low dose and then gradually increased.\n*Arterial hypertension: Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, \u03b2-blockers are equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events, but are less effective in preventing stroke. \u03b2-blockers are no longer a first-line treatment for essential hypertension. They are used as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure and when heart rate needs to be controlled.\n*Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n\n==='''''Other information'''''===\n\n*Chronic open-angle glaucoma: first-line treatment (local administration in the form of eye drops).\n*Migraine: background treatment as first-line treatment (metoprolol, propranolol).\n*Thyrotoxicosis: adjuvant treatment.\n\n*Treatment of somatic manifestations of anxiety\n*Preventive treatment of ruptured oesophageal varices\n\n==''Undesirable effects'''==\n\n*frequent asthenia, bradycardia, cold extremities and Raynaud's phenomenon\n*frequent insomnia and nightmares. \u03b2-blockers are not responsible for depressive episodes.\n*Rare atrioventricular conduction disorders.\n*Bronchoconstriction, rare\n*Prolongation/masking of hypoglycaemia in diabetics on sulphonamides or insulin, rare.\n*Risk of aggravation of heart failure, rare.\n*Psoriasis, exceptional.\n*Rebound effect on abrupt cessation of treatment: tachycardia, high blood pressure, sweating, nervousness. In practice, doses should be gradually reduced until treatment is stopped.\n*After administration in the form of eye drops, absorption through the ocular and nasal mucosa is possible, which may lead to the undesirable effects described above.\n\n==Drug interactions ==\nMainly pharmacodynamic interactions.\n\n==''Contraindications'''==\n\n*Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, the benefit/risk balance of progressively-dosed cardioselective \u03b2-blockers in these patients with coronary artery disease is positive, at the cost of iatrogenicity.\n*Uncontrolled heart failure\n*Bradycardia and second- and third-degree atrioventricular block without equipment\n*Prinzmetal's angina\n*Severe Raynaud's phenomenon\n*In moderate arteriopathy of the lower limbs, the benefit/risk balance is favourable for cardioselective \u03b2-blockers.\n*Hypotension\n\n==Monitoring procedures\nClinical",
