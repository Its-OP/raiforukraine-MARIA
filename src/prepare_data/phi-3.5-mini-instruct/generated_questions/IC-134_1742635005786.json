As a result, treatment depends little or not at all on the aetiology, and if possible is based on an analysis of the pain mechanisms.\n\n\n'''<u>Main etiologies of neuropathic pain</u>''''\n\n\n- The most common cause of neuropathic pain in the general population is radiculopathy, particularly sciatica (herniated disc, post-spinal surgery, disc disease, etc.).\n\n- Other peripheral causes are :  \n\n- Surgery or trauma leading to nerve damage (e.g. post-thoracotomy pain, post-mastectomy pain, total prosthesis, inguinal hernia surgery, dental avulsion, etc.).\n\n- Root canal syndrome (e.g. carpal tunnel).\n\n- Diabetic and non-diabetic neuropathy (alcohol, vasculitis, HIV, Guillain-Barr\u00e9, chemotherapy, toxic, genetic, deficiency, so-called \"idiopathic small fibre neuropathy\", etc.)\n\n- Shingles (post-herpes zoster pain)\n\n- Cancer (truncal or plexus invasion, radiation plexopathy or neuropathy, post-chemotherapy neuropathy, post-mastectomy pain syndrome caused by damage to the intercostobrachial nerve during axillary lymph node dissection)\n\n- Trigeminal neuropathy (V) (see also facial neuralgia), glosso-pharyngeal neuropathy (IX)\n\n- The main causes are :\n\n- Spinal cord injury (e.g. traumatic, myelitis, syringomyelia)\n\n- Stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic)\n\n- Severe head injury (with brain damage); spinal cord injury,\n\n- Multiple sclerosis\n\n\n'''<u>Diagnosis and main features</u>''''\n\n- Specific context of onset (e.g. diabetes, shingles, surgery, herniated disc, cerebrovascular accident, etc.), sometimes with a delay (several months or years after the initial event), especially in the case of a central lesion.\n\n- '''Particular quality of pain''': continuous spontaneous pain (such as burning/heat, painful cold, cramps), paroxysmal pain (electric shocks, stabbing), provoked pain (pain induced by friction, cold, heat)\n\n- Presence of ''paresthesias/dysesthesias'' in the painful area (paresthesias: abnormal non-painful sensations such as tingling, pins and needles, itching, numbness; dysesthesias: the same, but frankly unpleasant).\n\n- The pain is located in a ''neuro-anatomical territory compatible with peripheral nerve damage'' (symmetrical distal distribution beginning in the feet for length-dependent neuropathy, thoracic or trigeminal dermatomal for shingles, radicular for sciatica, etc.) or central (hemi-body for stroke/SEP, both lower limbs for spinal cord damage, etc.).\n\n- Pain is associated with ''hypoesthesia'' (hot, cold, stinging), ''allodynia'' (pain induced by normally painless stimulation) or ''hyperalgesia'' (increased pain in response to painful stimulation) \u00b1 motor deficit, reflex abnormality, spasticity (depending on the aetiological context).\n\n- Additional tests are not necessary to diagnose the neuropathic nature of the pain. They are useful for confirming the nerve lesion and its aetiology, depending on the clinical context.\n\n- The ''DN4'' questionnaire (neuropathic pain in 4 questions) ''differentiates DN from nociceptive pain'' with excellent sensitivity and specificity (> 80%) for a score \u2265 4 out of 10 (Fig 1) and \u2265 3 out of 7 for its ''questioning'' version (without clinical examination) which can be completed by a non-health worker or the patient.\n\n<u>Fig. 1 : Diagnostic questionnaire DN4</u> ''' ''''\n\nAccording to Bouhassira et al Pain 2005\n\n<br /><gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Pain2005.png\n</gallery>",
