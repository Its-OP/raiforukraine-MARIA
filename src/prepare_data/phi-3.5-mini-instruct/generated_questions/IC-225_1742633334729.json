It confirms the arterial origin of the claudication and distinguishes it from differential diagnoses (venous, rheumatological, neurological).\n\nIn the event of symptoms at rest, haemodynamic measurements are essential both to attribute these symptoms to OSA and to quantify the impact of the lesions. They enable the diagnosis of chronic permanent ischaemia to be made:\n\n*ankle pressure < 50 mmHg\n*toe pressure < 30 mmHg\n*TcPO2 < 30 mmHg\n\nThe following investigations are not first-line tests:\n\n*'''Angioscanner of the aorta and arteries of the arteries of the lower limbs'''\n*'''Angio-MRI''' '''of the aorta and arteries of the arteries of the lower limbs'''\n*'''Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SDD-239|arteriography of the lower limbs]''''\n\n===2/ Aetiological assessment===\nAn assessment of cardiovascular risk factors complements the lesion assessment, with first-line biology looking for dyslipidaemia, diabetes and chronic renal failure.",
