Doppler enables anomalies to be identified.\n|Rubric=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=Simon Soudet, Marie-Antoine Sevestre Pietri, Sophie Blaise\n|Order=9}}\nThe diagnosis of CVI is based on questioning in search of functional signs, clinical examination and recourse to complementary examinations (''SDD-[[Demande d'un examen d'imagerie SD-231|demande d'un examen d'imagerie]]'').\n\nClinical signs are sought in a patient in a standing position (phlebology stepladder), with the lower limb examined in external rotation and slightly flexed in the case of the great saphenous vein. The examination must be bilateral and comparative.\n\nInspection and palpation of the veins: a distinction is made between varicose veins of the greater saphenous vein and lesser saphenous vein sectors, and non-systematised varicose veins. Palpation looks for pain and induration suggestive of superficial venous thrombosis.\n\nIn addition to the clinical examination, a venous Doppler ultrasound is performed in the standing position to confirm the diagnosis. It will look for reflux in the deep and superficial venous network.\n\nMixed aetiology of the ulcer is common, so SPIs or toe pressure should be measured where appropriate.",
