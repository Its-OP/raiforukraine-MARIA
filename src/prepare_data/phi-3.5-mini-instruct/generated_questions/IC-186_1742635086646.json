A negative test generally rules out an allergy\n\n- Multi-allergen test (in primary care if no short-term allergic opinion is available), then specific IgE (peanut and nuts).\n\n- a provocation test to provide proof, if necessary, that the suspected food is responsible (gold standard).\n\n\nTreatment is based on the treatment of anaphylaxis during the 1st<sup>er</sup> allergic accident (see Lisa 388 fact sheet), and \"secondary prevention\" via the avoidance of the allergen and therapeutic education, (in particular by training the patient / those around him in the treatment of anaphylaxis).",
