Squamous cell carcinoma is rarer (30 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year).  Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is 2 to 3 times more common in men than in women.\n\n\nThe risk of developing carcinoma is higher in subjects with a light phototype (I and II) and the incidence increases with age.\n\nSun exposure is the main factor promoting carcinomas, both chronic and cumulative exposure (EC and BCC) and intense and intermittent sun exposure (BCC).\n\nImmunosuppression (organ transplants, chronic haematological diseases, HIV infection, etc.) is also a risk factor for skin carcinomas.\n\nCarcinomas develop mainly in areas exposed to light, particularly the face and back of the hands.\n\n\nThe phototype corresponds to an individual's ability to interact with the sun. Six phototypes are defined according to eye colour, hair colour, the presence of ephelides (freckles), sensitivity to sunburn and the ability to tan (Fitzpatrick phototype classification).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nThe incidence of melanoma varies throughout the world depending on the phototype of the population and UV exposure (latitude). In France, it is 15 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year and has been rising for several decades.\n\n\nThe main risk factors for developing melanoma are :\n\n- Light phototype (blond or redhead, ephelides, light eyes)\n\n- High number of nevi (>50)\n\n- High number of atypical nevi (>10)\n\n- Personal history of melanoma\n\n- Family history of melanoma (10% of melanomas occur in a family context)\n\n- Sunburn in childhood or sudden, intense exposure to the sun.\n\n\nIn the majority of cases (80%), the melanoma appears de novo and not on a pre-existing nevus or precursor.\nPhototype\nReaction to the sun\n!phenotype\n|-\n|I\n|Tanning = 0\nSunburn = systematic\n|Very fair complexion\nLight eyes\n\nBlonde or red hair\n\nNumerous ephelidesh\n|-\n|II\n|Brown = +/- (with difficulty)\nSunburn = often\n|Very fair complexion\nBlonde or chestnut hair\n\nUV-induced ephelides\n|-\n|III\n|Tanning = gradual\nSunburn = sometimes\n|Light complexion\nBrown eyes\n\nBlonde or chestnut hair\n|-\n|IV\n|Tanning = easy\nSunburn = little\n|Matt complexion\nBrown or chestnut hair\n\nDark eyes\n|-\n|V\n|Tanning = very easy\nSunburn = exceptional\n|Dark skin\nDark hair\n\nDark eyes\n|-\n|VI\n|Tan = constant\nSunburn = absent\n|Dark skin\nDark brown eyes\n|}",
