This is the only way of obtaining a definite diagnosis.\n** Because palpitations are often transient in nature, it is rarely obtained on admission to the emergency department or on consultation.\n** If it cannot be obtained during the initial treatment, a ''Holter ECG'' is performed, with a recording time of 24 to 96 hours in the case of frequent palpitations (>1/week) or a ''long-term ambulatory ECG'' (7 to 21 days) in the case of less frequent symptoms.\n** If triggering circumstances are identified, a recording should be made under the usual conditions in which the palpitations occur, to make the examination more sensitive (e.g. stress test).\n* The ''inter-critical'' ECG\n** Carried out without palpitations, the ECG is often normal.\n** However, it can also provide clues as to the mechanism of the palpitations (e.g. ST segment elevation, ventricular pre-excitation, etc.).",
