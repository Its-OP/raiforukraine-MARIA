Information on therapeutic management, with particular emphasis on the risk/benefit ratio and the importance of compliance with drug treatment ([[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SD-279]] ; [[Follow-up of immunosuppressed patients SD-291]] ; [Identifying the consequences of a disease/situation on job retention SD-316]]; Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320]]; Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328]]; Assessment of compliance with treatment SD-354]).\n\n'''. Education and information''' (352. Explaining treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent))\n\n'''. Drug treatment'''\n\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with possible rotation of NSAIDs\n\n- Analgesics, avoiding the use of opioids (250. Prescribing analgesics)\n\n'''. Local treatments:''' in the case of arthritis (corticosteroid infiltration, isotopic synoviorthesis) or enthesopathy (cortisone infiltration).\n\n'''.

Non-pharmacological treatments'''\n\n- stopping smoking, regular physical activity (324. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (sleep, physical activity, diet, etc.)\n\n- physiotherapy :\n\n* Objectives: to reduce the risk of axial and peripheral ankylosis, i.e. loss of lumbar lordosis, increased dorsal kyphosis and cervical anteprojection, knee and hip flaccidity, and to maintain exercise capacity and function.\n* Means : Maintenance of joint amplitudes of the spine, thoracic cage and lower limbs, in active, assisted active and passive (postures). Exercise training. Self-rehabilitation +++\n\n- corset fitting only if spinal deformity is progressive.\n\n'''. Surgery: '''' prosthetic joint replacement (coxitis), rarely spinal osteotomy to correct major dorsal kyphosis.\n\n'''. Social cover: '''' 100% cover (ALD) for severe or disabling forms.",
