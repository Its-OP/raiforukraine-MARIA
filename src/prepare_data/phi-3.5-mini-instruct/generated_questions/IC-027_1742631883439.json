Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by viral DNA testing.\n\nTransmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n- In the event of a high viral load during pregnancy, antiviral treatment should be started.",
