    "question": "In the context of acute III paralysis, which of the following scenarios necessitates urgent neuroradiological exploration to rule out an intracranial aneurysm?",
    "option_a": "Partial oculomotor damage with pupillary signs of intrinsic III damage, especially in young people without vascular risk factors and accompanied by headaches.",
    "option_b": "Complete oculomotor paralysis without pupillary signs, in elderly patients with well-controlled hypertension.",
