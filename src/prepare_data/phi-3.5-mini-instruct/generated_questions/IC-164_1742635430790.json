It is accompanied by moderate fever and inconstant lymphadenopathy, particularly in the retroauricular and posterior cervical regions.\n\nComplications are rare and include thrombocytopenia, joint damage (rare in children) and, more rarely, neurological damage.\n\nTreatment is symptomatic\n\n\n'''Risk during pregnancy/Fetopathy/Congenital rubella''''\n\nTransplacental passage of the virus during the \"first months of pregnancy (before 18 weeks' gestation)\" is responsible for a risk of death in utero or congenital malformations that is all the higher the earlier the pregnancy (70% to 100% risk if primary infection before 11 weeks' gestation, up to 80% between 12 and 18 weeks' gestation).\n\nViremia during embryogenesis can cause damage to the central nervous system and/or the inner ear and/or the eye and/or the cardiovascular system.\n\nCongenital rubella can therefore result in growth retardation, sensory damage (deafness, eye damage), neurological damage (developmental delay, microcephaly) or even cardiac malformations (examination of the newborn at term SD-039).",
