It therefore depends on the alpha confidence level of the CI (generally 5%), the desired precision and the expected value of the estimated parameter.\n\nFor ''analytical and experimental studies'', this is the minimum number of subjects that must be included in the sample (and analysed) to guarantee sufficient ''power'' for the study (cf. [[Factors likely to influence the power of a study 2C-020-DE-A10]]). It depends on statistical parameters (risk of 1<sup>rst</sup> alpha species, risk of 2<sup>th</sup> beta species) and clinical parameters (effect size - see [[Effect size 2C-323-DE-A06]] - and variability of the endpoint).",
