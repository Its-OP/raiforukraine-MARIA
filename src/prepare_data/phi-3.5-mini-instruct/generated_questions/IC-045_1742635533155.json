In the event of a balanced anomaly in one parent, the family branch concerned should be further investigated in order to identify the other carriers.\n\nThe increased risk of recurrence after the birth of a child with Down's syndrome means that parents can request a foetal karyotype if they so wish.\n\nIf the parents do not wish to take the risk of miscarriage, PND can be offered.\n\nMen with Down's syndrome have reduced fertility. A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome. The children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced but pregnancies are possible. The risk of trisomy 21 is around 30% in women with trisomy 21.",
