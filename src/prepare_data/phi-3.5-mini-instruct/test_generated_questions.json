In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5/1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing;\n\n'''115.

Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor (civil or criminal).\n\n'''Misconduct and disciplinary sanctions'''\n\nDisciplinary offences\n\nAny breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des M\u00e9decins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.\n\nThis Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des m\u00e9decins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.\n\nDisciplinary sanctions\n\nThe penalties incurred are a warning, a reprimand, a temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities, a temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years) or removal from the roll of the Ordre.\n\nTemporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.\n\n'''Implementation of disciplinary liability'''\n\n'''Jurisdictions'''\n\nThe competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.\n\n'''Referral'''\n\nReferrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by a departmental council of the Ordre, the national council of the Ordre, a doctor, a doctors' union, the director of the regional health agency, the prefect, the public prosecutor and the minister responsible for health.\n\nFor doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, the Conseil national de l'Ordre, the Director of the Regional Health Agency, the Prefect, the Public Prosecutor and the Minister for Health.\n\nA patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation.\n\nIf this fails, the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil r\u00e9gional de l'Ordre.\n\n'''Procedure'''\n\nThe patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague. Proceedings before the Order's courts are adversarial; the hearing is public.",

Their prescription will therefore be guided by the clinical context and especially if there are warning signs.\n\nIf a biological check-up is prescribed, it will include: Blood count, C-reactive protein, TSH, blood glucose, creatinine, blood ionogram, blood calcium.\n\n\n'''Functional examinations'''\n\n'''- Colonic transit time using radio-opaque markers'''\n\n           This examination is based on an unprepared abdomen X-ray after ingestion of radiopaque markers for 5 to 6 days in order to assess their number and distribution on the colonic frame.

However, it has a low sensitivity and high inter- and intra-individual variability. It should be carried out after laxatives have been stopped.\n\n\nAnorectal manometry\n\nThe aim of this examination is to identify a functional disorder of exoneration. In fact, dyschezia, which is a clinical symptom, may show up in anorectal manometry as abdomino-perineal asynergy (or asynchronism), i.e. the absence of relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter when pushing.\n\nIt is usually performed without prior preparation, in a conscious patient lying on his or her left side. The principle is to use a probe introduced via the anal route and topped by a balloon.\n\n\n'''Morphological examinations'''\n\n'''- Defecography'''\n\nThe aim of this dynamic radiological examination is to look for an anatomical disorder causing dyschezia (problems with pelvic statics). It involves opacifying the rectum and, more often than not, the urinary and gynaecological tracts, and performing pushing movements. It is most often carried out when conservative treatments have failed and surgery is being considered.\n\n\n'''- Defeco-MRI or dynamic pelvic MRI'''\n\nThis examination is an alternative to defecography and the choice between the two examinations depends on the centres and the habits of the medical and surgical teams.\n\n\n'''- Opaque enema in children:''''\n\nThis examination is indicated in cases of suspected Hirschprung's disease.",

The studies enable a sample of these variables to be observed. Statistical tests are used to conclude whether the observed result can (null hypothesis), or cannot (alternative hypothesis), be explained by chance (due to sampling fluctuations) by determining a priori a threshold for the risk of making a mistake in concluding that the result is not due to chance (alpha risk of 1<sup> species</sup>, often set at 5%).\n\nThe interest of a study is not its raw results but its \"inference\" (extrapolation of the results observed on a sample to the population from which it is drawn). The risk of being wrong (due to sampling fluctuations) can be quantified by statistical tests and the estimation of confidence intervals.\n\nIn science, the \"hypothetico-deductive approach\" consists of formulating hypotheses and then testing their validity by conducting experiments and collecting data.\n\n'''Null hypotheses and alternatives:'''\n\nIn statistics, a hypothesis test is a procedure for deciding between two hypotheses:\n\n*''The null hypothesis'', noted H0: This is the hypothesis which we seek to reject, but which we want to have ''little chance'' of rejecting if it is true. For example: the effect of treatment A is the same as the effect of treatment B''. The ''first order risk'', noted \"alpha\", is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (P(reject H0 | H0 true)). By convention, we often set the first-species risk at 5%.\n*'''The alternative hypothesis''', noted H1: This is the complementary hypothesis to the null hypothesis, which we seek to accept. ''Continuation of the example: the effect of treatment A is different from the effect of treatment B''. '''The second-order risk''', noted \"beta\", is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (P(rejection H0 | H1 true)). The ''power'' of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis is true (1-beta).\n\n'''Power of a statistical test'''\n\nA statistical test is designed to be as powerful as possible for a fixed first-species risk (often 5%). The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Parameter'''\n|'''Influence on power''''\n|-\n|Size of sample analysed N\n|If N increases, power increases\n|-\n|Difference to be detected d\n|If d increases, power increases\n|-\n|Variability of observations (variance)\n|If variance increases, power decreases\n|-\n|Alpha risk\n|If alpha increases, power increases\n|-\n|One-tailed or two-tailed test\n|If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.\n|}\nIn practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).\n\n'''Stages of a statistical test:'''\n\nA statistical test is always based on the following steps:\n\n*Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis\n*Set the risk of error of the first kind.\n*Reduce what should often be observed if the null hypothesis were true, and thus determine a rejection zone for the null hypothesis.\n*Verify whether or not what is observed in the study is consistent with what would be expected under the null hypothesis.\n*If what is observed is consistent, the result of the test is the non-rejection of the null hypothesis (which does not mean that the null hypothesis is true, because the beta risk is never zero). If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is no significant difference.\n*If what is observed is not consistent, the result of the test is the rejection of the null hypothesis. There is always a risk of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (the alpha risk), but in this case we are allowed to conclude in favour of the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is a significant difference.\n*Calculate the significance level (see item 20_29).\n\n'''Single or bilateral test:''''\n\nWhen the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, the alternative hypothesis can be constructed in two ways:\n\n*bilaterally: the alternative hypothesis then corresponds to a difference, whatever its meaning. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B OR the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A''.\n*unilaterally: the alternative hypothesis corresponds to a difference in a single direction. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B. It cannot be concluded that the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A.''A difference that is not significant bilaterally may be significant unilaterally.\n\n'''Independence or matching of observations:'''\n\nIn a study, totally independent or paired measurements can be collected:\n\n*When each measurement is obtained in different and independent individuals, all measurements are totally independent. For example: ''blood glucose measurement 7 days after inclusion in the study \u21d2 measurements all independent.''\n*When certain measurements are obtained from the same individual, or from different but matched individuals (for example in a case-control study), these measurements are said to be matched. For example: ''blood glucose measurement at inclusion then 7 days after inclusion in the study \u21d2 two paired measurements in the same individual.''\n\nStatistical tests for independent data or paired data are not the same (but are based on the same steps as those described above).\n\n'''Parametric and non-parametric tests:''''\n\nEach statistical test has its own conditions of application. Certain conditions of application are based on the probability law of the underlying random variables being analysed.\n\nA parametric test is based on a certain hypothesis concerning the probability distribution. For example, a Student's t test is based on the assumption that the random variable being analysed follows a normal distribution.\n\nA non-parametric test makes no assumptions about the probability distribution.\n\n'''Choice of statistical test:''''\n\nThe choice of statistical test depends on :\n\n*the type of ''endpoint'' (called the variable to be explained or the dependent variable)\n*the type of ''exposure factor'' (called the independent or explanatory variable)\n*The structure of the data studied: ''independent'' or ''matched''.\n*The ''sample size'' (\u2265 30 or < 30) and the statistical ''distribution'' of the variables (normal or not) when they are quantitative:\n**A parametric test is only feasible if certain conditions are met (sample size \u2265 30, normal distribution of the variable, etc.).\n**If this is not the case, a non-parametric test must be performed.\n\nTable.

The selection criteria are based on :\n\n*L'''' authorisation de mise sur le march\u00e9'' (AMM) of the medicinal product in a ''precise indication''. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and carried out under strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.\n*The \"level of evidence\" of the drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should always be guided by the ''highest level of evidence'', and where the level of evidence is equal, preference should be given to the medicinal product with the greatest experience of use.\n*The patient's ''pre-therapeutic assessment'', the ''therapeutic objective'' defined and the individual benefit-risk ratio previously established for this patient.\n\n==Treatment evaluation\nOnce the prescription has been made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers :\n\n*The ''efficacy of the treatment'', which must be consistent with the therapeutic objective defined above.\n*Assessment of the drug's ''safety profile'', which will focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.\n*Drug monitoring, based on clinical data (e.g. blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g. blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment) and pharmacovigilance data, pharmacological therapeutic monitoring OIC-321-02-A|pharmacological therapeutic monitoring]]'' (measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation, for example).\n\nThese elements of treatment evaluation enable the \"benefit-risk ratio\" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period, and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.",

In addition, total social protection expenditure other than benefits (\u20ac59 billion) has risen very sharply (+24.6% compared with -2.0% in 2019). This non-benefits item includes in particular additional expenditure linked to the health crisis, amounting to \u20ac11 billion, such as the purchase of masks and equipment linked to the health crisis or financial aid granted to healthcare professionals due to their reduced activity during the confinements.\n\n\nThe two main social risks accounting for the largest financial burden remain old age (43%) and health (33%) of social protection expenditure (Chart 1). The growth in social protection expenditure is linked in particular to employment support measures as a result of the introduction of short-time working.\n\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:19-G1 social benefits.png\n</gallery>\n\n\nOld-age and survivors' benefits have slowed down since the introduction of four major reforms to the pension system in 1993, 2003, 2008 and 2010: 1) indexation of pensions to inflation rather than wages, 2) calculation of pensions based on the best 25 years instead of the best 10 in the private sector, 3) increase in the number of years needed to qualify for the full rate, 4) increase in the legal age for entitlement from 60 to 62.\n\n\n'''However, the average amount of pensions is inevitably increasing'' in social protection for several reasons:\n\n1) the rise in real wages over the generations, 2) the retirement of baby-boomers, who outnumber current generations, and 3) longer life expectancy.\n\n\nAs far as health risk is concerned, the rate of increase in expenditure has been slowed since the 1980s by a number of reform plans: 1) 1982-1983 (reduction in the reimbursement of certain drugs, etc.), 2) 1986 and 1993, which increased the proportion of expenditure to be borne by households, 3) 1996, with the introduction of the national target for health insurance expenditure (Ondam), which aims to control expenditure by basic schemes. This target was regularly exceeded until 2009, but the 2004 Health Act and the ongoing strengthening of its control and monitoring mechanisms have ensured that it has been respected since 2010.\n\nHowever, health insurance benefits in France will increase by 4.3% (after +2.4% in 2019) to \u20ac228 billion.\n\nThis increase can be explained by :\n\n- by increases in the provision of care in the hospital sector and, to a lesser extent, in outpatient care. Despite an overall fall in the volume of care outside covid-19-related care, public hospital expenditure has increased due to higher remuneration (Covid-19 bonuses, S\u00e9gur de la sant\u00e9 measures) and the additional costs of caring for patients with Covid-19. Outpatient treatment is also increasing, despite the drop in consultations with GPs and specialists due to the epidemic, but there has been a spectacular rise in laboratory procedures (Covid-19 screening tests). Lastly, daily benefits (IJ) increased by 24.4% in 2020 for two reasons. Firstly, the so-called \"derogatory\" IJs were used to compensate people who had to stop working during the initial confinement (parents without childcare, vulnerable people, self-employed workers). On the other hand, sick pay also increased, due to sick leave linked to the epidemic waves. Medical and social benefits (health and disability) will also increase in 2020. As in the hospital sector, this increase is primarily the result of pay rises for employees working in the facilities, as well as additional funding paid out to deal with the health crisis. Disability benefits will increase by 3.6% (after 3.3% in 2019), due to the automatic extension of entitlement to disability compensation benefits. On the other hand, benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases will fall in 2020 as a result of the fall in the number of accidents at work, which in turn is due to the reduction in professional activities and the massive use of teleworking during the pandemic.",

It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.\n\nThe aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:1.jpg|'''Figure 1'''.

Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos.\n</gallery><br />Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths=\"800\" heights=\"600\">\nFile:2.jpg|'''Figure 2''. A-B.

Autonomy, presumed consent, anonymity, free of charge (or non-proprietary), restoration of the body, justice, role of the trusted support person, role of relatives.\n|Rubrique=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Ordre=23}}'''Ethical and legal principles of organ donation''''\n\nThe donation of organs (heart, kidney, liver, lungs, etc.) or other elements of the human body (blood, marrow, sperm, skin, corneas, etc.) is now an essential part of life-saving medical practice.\n\nThis is a major public health need, since around 5,000 transplants are carried out every year, but there is a large waiting list (13,000 needs per year, so 8,000 patients who have not been transplanted are waiting or at risk of death).\n\nAll doctors and healthcare professionals therefore have a central role to play in raising awareness among the public, patients and families.\n\nAccording to studies, public opinion has changed in recent years: 84% of French people are in favour of organ donation and agree that their organs should be removed in the event of their death.  There has been a real shift in public opinion on this subject. Agreeing to donate one's organs is now seen as a generous, altruistic gesture.\n\nThe Bioethics Laws have reinforced and developed the principles of the so-called Caillavet Law of 1976, the first law to establish organ donation in France. The current law is based on several principles:\n\n* Removal for scientific or therapeutic purposes ;\n* Respect for the human body: inviolable, not subject to property rights;\n* Rules governing consent;\n* Donation free of charge;\n* Anonymity between donor and recipient;\n* Diagnosis of death;\n* Health safety of samples of human body parts (screening for transmissible diseases);\n* The role of the Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine (ABM), which is responsible for managing the waiting list and allocating transplants.\n\n\n'''The principles of free and anonymous donation.'''\n\nThese principles are enshrined in French law.\n\nAs Jean Rostand pointed out in 1966, attacks on the corpse will only be tolerable if they are carried out with a generous and noble intention, with positive clinical, scientific or educational ends in mind.\n\nYet we live in a society where free services are not taken for granted. In a strictly utilitarian economic system such as ours, many things are based on an interpretation of value in terms of money, in a market system. What's more, more and more people have to pay to go to the beach, to walk along a river, to go to the toilet, sometimes to look at a landscape. In this de facto environment, there is a risk that all human activity will be subject to the laws of the market.\n\nMedical practice in France does not opt for the market. It chooses solidarity, based on the principle of universal access to healthcare for all, with respect for the principle of equality. What's more, we come from a philosophical tradition, stemming from the Enlightenment, which promoted the abolition of slavery, in other words the abolition of the commercialisation of people and bodies. In this way, free medical care makes it possible to prevent trafficking in human beings and organs. It also makes it possible to protect the weakest members of society, particularly in the case of living donors, so that they are not encouraged to live off the sale of their bodies. The same applies to the heirs of a deceased person, so that they cannot trade in their mortal remains.\n\nAnonymity and secrecy \"de facto\" reinforce the principle of gratuity, as they prevent any contact between the donor's environment and that of the recipient. It also allows families' lives to be respected and protected (avoiding abusive claims or thanks, delicate relationship problems between the families concerned, making it easier for the donor's family to mourn, etc.).\n\nThey also ensure respect for the privacy of recipients (respect for the convalescence of a person destined to live with an organ or tissue that is foreign to their own body).\n\nAs the philosopher J. Derrida has pointed out, giving does not imply any logic of reciprocity. According to Derrida, giving without expecting to receive is an altruistic concept of total gratuitousness.\n\n\n'''Concerning consent and the issues it raises.'''\n\nSince 1976, consent has been presumed for deceased donors (anyone who has not made known their refusal to donate organs or tissues during their lifetime is considered to have consented).\n\nHowever, it is now possible for deceased donors to express their refusal. This is done either through a national register of refusals, or through the testimony of relatives.\n\nAs far as the register is concerned, anyone aged 13 or over may register, without going through the intermediary of a third party. This refusal may be either to oppose samples being taken for therapeutic purposes, or for so-called scientific medical autopsy purposes, or for research purposes, but the opposition may not concern forensic autopsies (so as not to hinder the judicial process of seeking the truth). The register can also be used to specify the part or parts of the body that you do not wish to donate.\n\nThere is a special case for donations from deceased minors or adults under guardianship. In these cases, consent is obtained from the parents (each of the holders of parental authority) or the guardian.\n\nThe question of the testimony of the family and close relations was framed by a law of 7 August 2004, which specifies that the doctor must endeavour to find out from the trusted support person and close relations whether there is any opposition expressed by the deceased during his lifetime. The aim is therefore to bear witness to the wishes of the deceased, and not to formulate his opinion as a close relative. But in practice, isn't the dividing line sometimes complex?\n\nWhat's more, this often raises a question on a day-to-day basis: who should be given priority in the family or among close friends? What happens in the event of disagreement? What is the hierarchy? This is why the law encourages all citizens, including those in good health, to appoint a trusted support person to act as a witness. If there is a designated trusted support person, he or she takes precedence over any other relative. Lastly, although it is not mentioned in the law, it is important to note the importance of the patient's written consent and the fact that the patient should carry a signed donor card.\n\nThis delicate issue of consent by the deceased shows the major educational and psychological role that the coordination teams responsible for taking samples and for dialogue with next of kin must play.\n<br />",

It involves examinations carried out on pregnant women to diagnose a disease (infectious, haematological, genetic, etc.) in the foetus.\n\nIf a risk has already been identified in the family, the couple can decide to\n\n- the absence of any particular action and the assumption of the stated risk;\n\n- adoption ;\n\n- a request for prenatal diagnosis ;\n\n- a request for pre-implantation diagnosis.\n\nAntenatal diagnosis can also be carried out following the identification of an anomaly during pregnancy monitoring (biological or ultrasound). The couple's proposal for an examination is discussed at the CPDPN (Multidisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis). The couple is then offered genetic tests ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]) which require invasive sampling to collect foetal material (cells, DNA), most often by chorionic villus puncture or amniocentesis.\n\no Fetal karyotype if an abnormality in chromosome number is suspected;\n\no Chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (ACPA or CGH array) in cases of suspected unbalanced chromosomal abnormality other than an abnormal number;\n\no Targeted sequencing/analysis in cases of suspected gene syndrome or genetic disease identified in the family;\n\no Some centres are beginning to offer exome testing in cases where there is a suspicion of a gene syndrome but no clear indication;\n\n\nIf a woman is diagnosed with a particularly serious illness that is incurable at the time of diagnosis, she may request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG) on medical grounds, regardless of the term. This request is discussed at a CPDPN and may be accepted if the illness meets the 2 criteria mentioned above:\n\n- Particular gravity ;\n\n- Incurable at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThe CPDPN can also suggest drug therapies and, in rare cases, surgery to treat the foetus, as in the case of diaphragmatic hernia.\n\n\n'''Prenatal screening for trisomy 21'''\n\nDoctors must inform patients of the possibility of [[Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 SD-307|prenatal screening for trisomy 21]], which is covered by the health insurance scheme. This screening must be preceded by information to the patient about trisomy 21 and the screening procedures, and requires her prior written consent. The screening process is not compulsory and the patient may withdraw from the process at any time.\n\nScreening enables a risk to be assessed, but does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In the event of positive screening, the definitive diagnosis will be made by carrying out a foetal karyotype.\n\nIn the event of a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 21, it is essential to arrange a systematic consultation with a geneticist to provide information on the prognosis and genetic counselling, prior to any decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, even if the parents decide to do so in advance.",

The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> \u21d4 H2CO3 \u21d4 CO2 + H2O\n*This buffer system is said to be \"open\" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.\n*Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH<sub>blood</sub> = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/[H2CO3]) = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/0.03 PC02)\n*The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO2 and HCO3<sup>-</sup> is modified, i.e. :\n**when there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO3<sup>-</sup> ions. This is known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis,\n**or when there is a primary change in PCO2. This is known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.\n\nB.    The main sources of acid\n\n*There are two main sources of acid:\n**Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O2, water and CO2 (oxidative metabolism). The CO2 generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO2 leads to respiratory acidosis.\n**Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H2SO4 for sulphur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H2P04 for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.\n\nC.    Role of the lung in acid-base balance\n\n*By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO2 of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO2 through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO2 by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.\n*Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO2 and pCO2, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.\n\nD.    Role of the kidney in acid-base balance\n\n*Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.\n*Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",

To be familiar with the conditions for their appointment and their roles.\n|Rubric=Management\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=8}}The right to appoint a trusted support person is enshrined in article L.1111-6 of the CSP (public health code). For a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the \"trusted support person\" in the \"health democracy\" law of 4 March 2002.\n\nThe role of the trusted support person, in the original sense of the term, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically, and to liaise with the medical teams, once the patient has designated one (a designation that allows the confidentiality of information to be shared). In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.\n\nThis primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still seen only as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person is called upon to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is an important one.\n\nEven outside the hospital setting, anyone being cared for in our healthcare system may feel the need to be accompanied by someone close to them, regardless of the status of their illness (whether in the case of severe illnesses or \"ordinary\", everyday illnesses). In addition, any citizen, even if they are not ill, who receives a healthcare service (e.g. screening, preventive action, blood tests, X-rays, etc.), may also wish to be accompanied by someone. Finally, anyone can accidentally find themselves in a situation where they are faced with a complex end-of-life decision. From a more collective point of view, we should therefore offer this possibility of designation to all citizens, as soon as they meet their doctor, insofar as the law provides for the trusted support person to be consulted to testify to the subject's wishes, to find out a person's wishes regarding a decision to stop or limit life-sustaining treatment or the question of post-mortem organ removal, all situations that can arise accidentally independently of an illness.\n\nThe appointment of a trusted support person must therefore be extended beyond the context of severe pathologies and hospitalisation alone, to become a civic option, available to everyone in the general population, regardless of their clinical condition. In practice, patients and their families are not necessarily familiar with this procedure. It is the duty of every healthcare provider and every healthcare institution to offer it.\n\nThe first thing to do is to explain that any adult relative can be a trusted support person: brother, sister, parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, spouse, partner, friend, member of an association, etc. You should explain to the patient the purpose of this appointment, while also explaining that it is not compulsory. It is a possibility that patients must be able to choose (accept or refuse if they feel neither the need nor the desire to do so), especially if they wish to keep the secret completely, or if they wish to protect all those close to them and keep their illness a secret.\n\nIn previous years, it has been observed that designated trusted third parties were sometimes unaware that they had been chosen by a patient, as they were not present and not involved in the designation process; this raised doubts about their legitimacy to subsequently participate in an ethical discussion concerning the patient. This is why, from now on, the designation, made in writing by the patient, must be co-signed by the designated person. The procedure for designating and collecting information from the trusted support person must therefore be properly organised, ensuring that there is a reference person within the healthcare team responsible for informing the patient and then the designated person.\n\nThe role of the carer is to advise the patient on the basis of his or her experience of the illness and the sometimes complex family or emotional environment. It is important to explain that both designation and non-designation are perfectly legitimate choices. This is why the Public Health Code stipulates that there is an obligation to propose a trusted support person, but not an obligation to designate one. Giving patients this freedom and guiding them in their best interests is an ethical responsibility. When explanations are given, the question of breaking confidentiality with regard to the designated relative should be discussed (how far does the patient wish to go with regard to confidences, at what point, etc.).\n\nWith regard to the persons designated, several important points will be raised, in particular their availability and their willingness to carry out this mission, which are essential to give meaning to the process. An explanation of how long the designation of a trusted support person is valid will be given: the law does not set a limit on the validity of the designation made. However, the ups and downs of life and the way a patient's experience of illness evolves mean that things can evolve and change over time. The spirit of the law and the legitimate variability of a person's choices mean that the patient should be informed of the possible change of designated person. The designation can be revoked at any time by the patient. For healthcare professionals, the recommendation is that the patient should be asked each time he or she is admitted to hospital again, or each time he or she undergoes a new cycle of care, whether the designated person will remain in place.\n\nIn fine, the designation should be made in writing, signed by the patient and the designated person, and recorded in the medical record, with precise contact details and the nature of the relationship between the patient and the designated person, including any updates.",

It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It affects one in every 4,700 births.  One subject in 35 is a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in France is F508del.  Life expectancy at birth is over 40 years.\n\nSituations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis\n\n- Ultrasound monitoring\n\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be raised during ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy when a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign which may reveal a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in around 5% of cases. This risk is increased if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by an absence of visualization of the gallbladder. A study of the CFTR gene is then carried out in the couple. If mutations in the gene are detected in one or both of the couple's partners, the mutations are tested in the foetus using an amniotic fluid sample.  \n\n- Family history of cystic fibrosis\n\nBoth parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation.\n\nThe risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhoea, or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhoea. Once the foetal DNA has been extracted, molecular biology is used to determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is only known for one parent, a full study of the CFTR gene must be carried out for the other spouse to determine the risk.\n\nOne of the parents has cystic fibrosis\n\nA parent with cystic fibrosis must pass on one of the two mutations he or she carries. It is necessary to determine the status of the spouse by carrying out an exhaustive study of the CFTR gene.  If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",

Severe LBW corresponds to a LBW below the 3rd percentile.\n\n- IUGR most often corresponds to PAG associated with arguments in favour of a pathological growth defect: longitudinal growth arrest or inflection (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).\n\n'''Risk factors:''''\n\n1 Foetal pathologies\n\nIn 10-20% of cases, IUGR has a foetal cause: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). IUGR tends to be early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and is often associated with morphological abnormalities.\n\n''2.    Vascular pathologies''\n\nThey account for 35-50% of IUGR. IUGR most often occurs late (in the 3rd trimester), but can occur early in severe forms. IUGR can recur in subsequent pregnancies.\n\nIn the case of IUGR, the arguments in favour of a vascular cause are :\n\n- association with hypertension or even pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]]''' and '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''). This association is frequent and very suggestive, but inconstant;\n\n- association with a chronic maternal pathology: chronic ''[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]]''', nephropathy (''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|Increased creatinine]]'''), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications (''[[Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320|Prevention of cardiovascular disease]]''');\n\n- a history of vascular IUGR in a previous pregnancy.\n\n- association with oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid);\n\n- abnormal uterine or umbilical Doppler, reflecting disturbances in maternal-foetal exchanges. These Doppler anomalies result in a quantifiable increase in circulatory resistance in the uterine and/or umbilical arteries (resistance index, pulsatility index) and spectral disturbances.\n\n''3.    Other causes and risk factors''\n\nThese are the following factors:\n\n- maternal age < 20 or > 35 ;\n\n- '''[[Malnutrition/malnutrition SD-030|Malnutrition/Denutrition]]'''', low weight gain during pregnancy ;\n\n- low socio-economic level ('''[[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|precarious social situation and isolation]]''') ;\n\n- smoking (''''[[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314|prevention of tobacco-related risks]]'''), alcoholism, drug addiction ;\n\n- uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids ('''[[Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-229|Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination]]''');\n\n- Placental abnormalities, such as a chorioangioma\n\n- velamentous insertion of the cord which must be systematically sought.\n\nFinally, a third of IUGRs remain poorly explained.\n\n<br />",

A drop of the diluted allergen to be tested is placed on an area of healthy skin. A small quantity of the allergen is then introduced into the epidermis by \"pricking through the drop\" (with a microlance or needle). A ''positive control'' (a drop of histamine) and a ''negative control'' (a drop of saline) are also taken. The \"15-minute reading\" is taken.\n\nThe allergen test is \"positive\" if an \"urticarial\" lesion appears as a result of the activation of mast cells carrying specific IgE antibodies to the allergen tested. The diameter of the urticarial papule must be at least 3 mm greater than the papule in the prick test carried out with the negative control (more often than not, the negative control does not produce a papule and is therefore \"perfectly negative\").\n\nThere are \"two conditions for declaring a prick test with the allergen to be negative\": 1) no papule on the test itself, 2) urticarial papule obtained on the histamine prick test (if there is no urticaria on the histamine test, the skin is not reacting overall and the negative test with the allergen is therefore uninterpretable).\n\nRare and usually mild side-effects of prick test: widespread local reaction, generalised urticaria, syndromic reaction (rhinitis, asthma). Exceptional anaphylactic reactions\n\n\n2) ''Patch tests'' explore ''delayed reactions'' and are usually performed on the patient's back, also on healthy skin. The allergen to be tested is placed in a small occlusive cup which is left in place for 48 hours. The cup is then removed and the test interpreted. The patch is considered positive if the area tested has an \"eczema-like\" appearance, indicating a local reaction of the delayed hypersensitivity type (see Lisa item 187: Eczema).\n\n\nRare and usually benign side-effects of the patch: eczema extending beyond the patch area or even spread of eczema to other areas (exceptional).\n\n\n3) ''Intra dermo-reaction'' (IDR) consists of injecting the allergen intradermally and carrying out either an immediate reading at 15 minutes (investigation of type I HS with deep urticaria associating local oedema, erythema and pruritus), or a delayed reading (investigation of type IV HS with infiltrated and often pruritic erythema at 48 hours).\n\n\nRare and usually benign side-effects of TST: those of pricks and patches, depending on the type of reaction investigated.\n\nVery rare cases of anaphylaxis during DSTs (mainly during hymenoptera venom tests and sometimes drug tests).",

In clinical practice, we sometimes experience the difficulty of providing information, particularly when faced with highly distressed patients, where the truth is difficult to tell and some patients are unable to bear it. Some former doctors used to quote St Thomas to justify not informing a patient: \"Man prefers a lie to the truth. Man prefers a lie to the truth that enlightens\". But apart from exceptional cases, this type of approach is a thing of the past. We believe that every patient has the right to know, so that they can participate in the organisation of their care pathway, but also so that they can organise their lives accordingly, in terms of both day-to-day aspects and fundamental choices. Providing information is a complex process but, like any medical skill, it can be learned. This learning process includes both the way in which the information is delivered and the way in which the patient is supported during the process, with a humanistic and psychological approach.\n\nThe law gives this development an additional dimension by placing information and consent within a contractual framework designed to assess the quality of medical practice, particularly in the event of conflict. Questions of the quality and completeness of information are part of this framework.\n\nHowever, a rare case should be mentioned: the wish not to know. This may constitute an exception to the patient's duty to inform if he or she has clearly expressed (data and arguments which must be noted in the medical record) the wish to be kept in the dark about a serious diagnosis or prognosis, or even about any information concerning his or her health and treatment. However, legal and ethical rules specify that this exception does not apply when third parties are exposed to a risk of contamination. This clarification, inspired by the case of AIDS, applies to all serious contagious diseases and is necessary because of the patient's responsibility towards others and in the interests of public health.\n\n== How far to inform: the question of serious or exceptional risks'' ==\nTwo types of situation may arise in medical practice, depending on whether or not there is a choice between different diagnostic and/or therapeutic hypotheses.\n\nIn the (most frequent) case where a treatment recognised and validated by medicine is proposed to the exclusion of all other options, the primary aim of the information provided is not to make a therapeutic choice (unless the patient opts to refuse treatment). The aim is to explain in an \"intelligible\" way the merits of the proposal put forward, in order to obtain the patient's assent and, where appropriate, any reservations he or she may have, to enable him or her to seek any help he or she may need and to organise his or her life accordingly. This is information of a medical and social nature, prior to acceptance (or refusal) of the proposed treatment, with the aim of health education to improve compliance with prescriptions and optimise the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nIn the case of diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives, on the other hand, information is part of a process of choice where, in theory, after being informed, the patient can opt for one proposal rather than another.\n\nHow far should we go in providing information? Should we talk about all the risks, including those of death linked to a treatment or those whose occurrence is exceptional?\n\nThe answers lie in the development of the legal rules governing the provision of information to a patient. Several criteria have been established to define the contractual framework between a doctor and his patient:\n\n* the capacity of persons to contract with each other (qualified doctor, registered with the Conseil de l'ordre on the one hand; patient, of legal age, legally capable on the other);\n* quality criteria concerning the commitment of the professional (obligation to use reasonable means, respect for professional secrecy, etc.) and of the patient (compliance with prescriptions and monitoring rules);\n* a lawful cause for the medical action: a clear and legitimate medical aim justifying the medical action that affects the patient's integrity;\n* consent must be obtained after the patient has been provided with quality information, without pressure, i.e. informed and free consent.\n\nIn this legal approach, information and consent become one of the criteria for the validity of a contract.\n\nWith regard to the characteristics of this information, on 21 December 1961 the Civil Division of the Court of Cassation emphasised that it should be \"simple, approximate, intelligible and fair\". Since 1995, article 35 of the Code of Medical Ethics has stipulated that:\n\n''\" The doctor owes the person he is examining, treating or advising fair, clear and appropriate information'' about his ''condition, the investigations and care he is proposing''. Throughout the course of the illness, he shall take account of the patient's personality in his explanations and ensure that they are understood\".\n\nWe note that the terms \"simple\" and \"approximate\" have disappeared, reflecting a desire to be more rigorous in the approach and rejecting excessive simplicity or approximation. As far as risks are concerned (bearing in mind that all medical procedures and prescriptions, even the most routine, involve them), the information must include them insofar as they are normally foreseeable.\n\nWith regard to the concepts of rarity and severity of the risk, in 2000 the Conseil d'\u00c9tat (an administrative court that rules on disputes involving public hospitals) stated that the mere fact that risks occur only exceptionally does not relieve the practitioner of his obligation, and that when a medical act entails a risk of death or invalidity the patient must be informed, even if this is exceptional.\n\nThese developments led to the law of 4 March 2002, which stipulates that all frequent or serious risks that are normally foreseeable must be brought to the patient's attention before a procedure is carried out, but also \"a posteriori\" (i.e. in the short, medium and long term), if new consequences and risks are identified.\n\n''\" Everyone has the right to be informed about their state of health. This information concerns the various investigations, treatments or preventive measures proposed, their usefulness, any urgency, their consequences, the frequent or serious risks normally foreseeable which they entail, as well as the other possible solutions and the foreseeable consequences in the event of refusal. When, after the investigations, treatments or preventive actions have been carried out, new risks are identified, the person concerned must be informed, unless it is impossible to trace him or her\". Law of 4 March 2002''\n\n== Rules and criteria for assessing the quality of the information provided ==\nAll healthcare professionals have a duty to provide information within the scope of their competence and in compliance with the professional rules applicable to them. The only exceptions to this duty are in cases of urgency or where it is impossible to provide information. This information is provided during an individual interview, as part of a dialogue. The purpose of the information is twofold:\n\n* respect patients' autonomy of choice by giving them all the information they need to make an informed decision, i.e. to consent to the proposed treatment;\n\n* to provide them with all the information they need to take part in their care and receive all the advice and assistance they need to organise their lives.\n\nThis information is provided first and foremost to the patient. If the patient so wishes (i.e. with his or her consent, so as not to breach medical confidentiality without his or her knowledge), it can be given in the presence of a close relative or a trusted person. However, to ensure that the patient remains free to talk about matters that he or she would not wish to discuss in the presence of a third party, it is important to suggest that the interview should initially be an individual one, and that the third party should only be invited secondarily. In the case of minors and patients who are unable to reach the age of majority, information is provided to their parents or legal representatives, but without excluding the patient from access to information. As soon as their age and situation allow, patients must themselves receive information adapted to their degree of maturity. In the case of minors, as far as possible, the information is given to the two holders of parental authority. If only one is present, the healthcare professional will explain the need to inform the other, whether or not the couple are separated. In situations where the prognosis or risk is serious, it is preferable to have an interview with both parents.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the provision of information must comply with certain rules of good practice: it must be based on complete, validated data that is up to date with advances in medicine and science (in practice, this means that the data must be up to date); it must be understandable to everyone (avoiding medical-technical formulations that are the domain of professional terms and skills); and finally, in terms of content, it must meet five essential points, which must be addressed and discussed with every patient and their representative: the aims of the medical approach, its advantages and disadvantages, its risks, as well as the risks of not implementing it, the constraints generated and the impact on daily life, possible help and support: social rights, help (professional and/or associative) to facilitate the person's progress through the care pathway and their daily life.\n\n== The place of the written word and the issue of traceability of information and consent ==\nIn practice, as far as the form is concerned, the information must remain above all oral''''''''. It may be aided by the provision of appropriate educational information documents to the patient. Apart from specific cases provided for by law (organ donation from a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.\n\nThe information document must meet the same quality criteria as those mentioned above. In addition, it is recommended that information documents should be drawn up by a collegiate body, within learned medical societies or healthcare groups and institutions, tested on patients and validated with user representatives. The advantage of consensual information of this kind is that it produces a benchmark drawn up by experts.\n\nThese documents should encourage patients to ask doctors any questions they may have. They can be enhanced with visual aids or linked to websites with animated diagrams or videos. They should be translated or explained in the patient's own language.\n\nAnother medico-legal issue concerns the traceability of the information provided, i.e. the elements that make it possible, in the event of a dispute, to prove that the patient has been properly informed. On 25 February 1997, a ruling by the French Supreme Court, known as the \"H\u00e9dreul ruling\" - named after the patient concerned - quashed and annulled the judgement of a Court of Appeal concerning a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp, following which the patient had suffered an intestinal perforation, the risk of which he claimed he had not been informed. Initially, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case, ruling that the patient had to prove that the doctor had not warned him. In its ruling, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed that doctors have a specific obligation to inform their patients; it also stated that it is now up to the doctor to prove that he has fulfilled this obligation (creating what has been called a reversal of the burden of proof, which no longer lies with the patient). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Court takes into account the reality of the consultation process, specifying that the methods of proof remain unrestricted and that, according to its ruling of 14 October 1997, information may be proven by any means, except in cases where a special legal provision imposes a particular method of proof (such as written consent, for example, in medical research, or for organ removal from living donors).\n\nSince this decision, we have seen the development of brochures or information sheets on examinations and treatments. However, it should be remembered that these documents, although recommended, and even if some have patients sign them, do not free doctors and healthcare structures from other approaches. The quality of the information provided covers other aspects, which will also be taken into account in the event of a dispute. The following will be taken into account: consultation times, information meetings organised by healthcare structures, brochures given to patients, letters exchanged between doctors (in particular with the general practitioner) with copies given to patients, elements of the medical file given to patients.\n\nIt is important that all these information sessions are recorded in the medical record (by whom, in whose presence, on what date), together with any difficulties encountered in providing them. It is also important to mention any situations in which it was impossible or complex to obtain information, and to justify this on the basis of the patient's clinical and social situation.\n\nIt is therefore important not to forget that a written document does not free the doctor from all the other means of information that he or she may deem necessary, and in particular that the oral time spent with the patient is of major importance.",

Ageing alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain remains ''under-estimated and under-treated'' and treatment must be ''individualised and adapted'' according to the patient's state of health (''co-morbidities and chronic treatments, state of emunctory functions).\n\n- Acute pain: certain acute pathologies that are usually painful in adults (myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, fractures) can be \"silent\" in the elderly, who often present late at the emergency department, consult and report their pain later than younger adults, with more complications that can be serious or even fatal.\n\n- Chronic pain: the prevalence is \"high\", affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions, with a variety of aetiologies (osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, iatrogenic, etc.).\n\n- Pain management is based on '''4 pillars:''' '''R'''ep\u00e9rage,''''E'''appraisal,''''T'''raitement and always Re-'''E'''appraisal of pain in order to judge the effectiveness of the approach adopted. It includes the care teams and/or the family.\n\n\n'''<u>Know the particularities of pain management in the elderly</u>''''\n\n\n'''Spotting'''\n\n- Some types of pain are predictable (pain during care, pressure sores, etc.), even if this is not specific to the elderly (see \"Prevalence and epidemiology\" section), while others are more difficult to anticipate (paroxysmal attacks of pain) or to identify.\n\n- You need to look for \"warning signs\" and have a pain reflex, especially if the behaviour is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming.\n\n- Any elderly person who expresses pain or behaviour suggestive of pain is indeed in pain. We need to apply the \"precautionary principle\" and fight against preconceived ideas, beliefs, fears and representations held by patients and those around them, such as \"It's normal to be in pain when you're old\".\n\n\n'''Evaluation'''\n\n- The patient will be correctly seated (environment, wearing of glasses, hearing aids and dental prostheses), with an empathetic and patient approach, a climate of trust and taking into account any cognitive or expressive difficulties.\n\n- A \"geriatric assessment\" (including depression and behaviour) is carried out in addition to identifying the components of the pain.\n\n- Self-assessment is carried out using a simple numerical or verbal scale rather than the VAS. In the event of failure, an observation of behaviours using a ''hetero-evaluation'' scale (Algoplus\u00ae, Doloplus\u00ae, ECPA\u00ae) is used, preferably in a team, and this evaluation is repeated regularly.\n\n\n'''Treatment'''\n\n- Ageing ''modifies the pharmacology'' (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy) of drugs, including analgesics. The analgesics and coantalgesics used are the same as those used by younger adults, but the adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous because of \"co-morbidities and polymedication\". The contribution of clinical pharmacists can be useful in screening for drug-related iatrogenia and in drug conciliation.\n\n- Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexists in the elderly.\n\n- Before any analgesic is prescribed, the patient's state of health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation and compliance must be ascertained. Dosage adjustments are recommended, dosages increased slowly (\"start low and go slow\"), and renal function monitored.\n\n- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.\n\n- It is recommended that analgesics be combined with non-pharmacological techniques, which are perfectly feasible with a few adaptations to the sensory deficits caused by ageing (sight, hearing, mobility).\n\n\n'''Revaluation'''\n\n- Always reassess to ''adapt and prioritise'' treatments in order to reduce multi-medication and optimise the benefit-risk balance.\n\n- An elderly patient who does not complain can be painful.",

Trials on non-patients were illegal. Approvals were granted on the basis of expert opinion. From 1975 onwards, demands for scientific proof and rigorous methodologies began to emerge.\n\n==Loi Huriet-S\u00e9rusclat (20 December 1988)==\nThis law sets out the principle of equality for all participants, whether sick or not. The terms \"protection of individuals\" are preferred to \"human experimentation\". It establishes two types of research: with direct individual benefit and without direct individual benefit. Constraints are heavier for the second type: it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the research sites, and the promoter may be held liable, even without fault.\n\nConsent must be \"free, informed and express\", in accordance with international texts. Special protection is sought for \"vulnerable\" persons. In keeping with the principle that the human body should be free of charge, the \"non-commercialisation\" of the human body is affirmed. No remuneration is possible, but \"compensation\" for participants \"without direct individual benefit\" who are not hospitalised is possible.\n\nThe law provides for the creation of Consultative Committees for the Protection of Individuals in Biomedical Research (CCPPRB), independent of the administrative authority. Research will not be possible if it is not based on the latest state of knowledge, if it is not preceded by sufficient pre-clinical experimentation, if there is a foreseeable risk out of all proportion to the expected benefit, if it does not aim to extend scientific knowledge of human beings and the means likely to improve their condition, if it is not designed to reduce pain, fear or discomfort. All these conditions are cumulative.\n\nIt can only be carried out under the direction and supervision of an experienced doctor. The material and technical conditions must be appropriate to the trial and compatible with the requirements of scientific rigour and personal safety. The interests of the patient must always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society.\n\nThis law is beneficial in that it provides legal certainty for investigators and requires prior examination of protocols and informed consent. However, a number of difficulties remain: it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a study has direct benefit or not, and the protection afforded to patients is worse than that afforded to healthy volunteers.\n\n==Law of 9 August 2004\nThis law transposes the 2001 European directive on clinical trials. It defines biomedical research: \"Biomedical research is research organised and carried out on human beings with a view to developing biological or medical knowledge\". Research occurs when, over and above the act of providing care and the immediate interests of the patient, the doctor seeks to advance scientific knowledge, i.e. to identify and formalise general teaching. This applies not only to the testing of techniques and products, but also to cognitive research.\n\nThe notions of direct or indirect benefit have been abandoned in favour of the notion of interventional and non-interventional trials. Non-interventional trials are excluded from the reform (observational survey, epidemiology). Research into routine care is subject to simplified procedures. Protocols are assessed on the basis of the benefit/risk balance rather than the therapeutic benefit. Protection is strengthened and the different protection regimes disappear.\n\nThe roles of the various players are well defined. The promoter is the natural or legal person who initiates the research, manages it and verifies its funding. The investigator is the natural person who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a given site. Where there are several investigators, a coordinator is appointed.\n\nThe Committees for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) replace the CCPPRB. The CPP is made up of fourteen members in two colleges. The medical college comprises four people qualified in research, including at least two doctors and one epidemiologist or biostatistician, one general practitioner, one hospital pharmacist and one nurse. The societal college is made up of a person qualified in ethics, a psychologist, a social worker, two persons qualified in legal matters and two representatives of associations (article R.1123-4 of the Public Health Code).\n\nThe opinion of the CPP becomes necessary and favourable. It is decision-making and no longer advisory. This opinion takes into account the information provided to the subject (time for reflection, adequacy, completeness and intelligibility of written information, oral information supported by a written text), the title of the protocol, the contact details of the sponsor and coordinating investigator, the objective, methodology and duration of the research, the expected benefits, the constraints and foreseeable risks, medical alternatives, care arrangements at the end of the research, access to results at the end of the research, confidentiality of data, the date of the opinion of the CPP and the authorisation of the competent authority and the insurance certificate issued by the sponsor. This opinion also takes account of the written consent obtained by the investigator, which must be free and informed. There are special cases: in the case of minors, consent is obtained from the legal representative; in the case of persons unable to express themselves, it is obtained from the trusted support person or the guardianship judge; in an emergency, it is obtained from the family or the trusted support person if they are present. The CPP's opinion is also based on the relevance of the research (scientific, methodological and ethical), the match between the objectives and the resources deployed, the satisfactory nature of the assessment of the expected benefits and risks and the soundness of the conclusions, the procedures for recruiting participants, the amount and procedures for compensating participants, registration on the National Volunteer Register (Internet) to prevent abuse, compliance with an exclusion period between two research studies, the quality of the research sites and the qualifications of the investigators.\n\nThe French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has become the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM). For products other than medicinal products, the competent authority is the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 (DGS). The declaration system is replaced by an authorisation system. Authorisation is valid for one year. The ANSM may request additional information or suspend research.\n\nSubjects taking part in the research must undergo a prior medical examination, be affiliated to a social security scheme, be registered in the national database, and have access to the overall results and information relating to their state of health. They may receive compensation, subject to a ceiling, for the constraints they have undergone or for the damage they have suffered (by the sponsor in the event of negligence or by a compensation fund in the absence of negligence). They may not take part in more than one research project at the same time.\n\nPatient associations and health system users are represented on the CPPs. Overall research results must be communicated. They may be included in national and European research databases (unless the sponsor objects).\n\n==Law of 5 March 2012 (Jard\u00e9 Law)==\nIn the law of 5 March 2012, also known as the \"law on research involving the human person\" (RIPH), the term \"biomedical research\" has been removed. It aims to provide a single framework for medical research and simplify the procedures involved. It distinguishes between three types of research: interventional research with risk, interventional research with negligible risk (aimed at evaluating routine care) and non-interventional or observational research.\n\nTypes of research defined by the law on research involving the human person :\n\n===1st category: interventional research involving an intervention on a person that is not justified by his or her usual care===\nIn risky interventional research, the intervention on the individual is not justified by his or her usual care (use of a new molecule, for example). Consent must be free, informed and express, and given in writing.\n\nThis research focuses on :\n\n*on medicinal products;\n*other health products (mentioned in article L.5311-1 of the French Public Health Code);\n*foodstuffs.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*authorisation from the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam for research involving medicinal products;\n*favourable opinion from the CPP (Committee for the Protection of Individuals);\n*specific insurance cover taken out by the sponsor;\n*formalities with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL; for example, commitment to comply with the MR001 reference methodology);\n*EudraCT number (used to identify each study carried out in the European Union; the sponsor must request this number from the European Medicines Agency).\n\n===2nd category: interventional research involving only minimal risks and constraints===\nNegligible-risk interventional research does not involve medicinal products and presents minimal risks and constraints. Consent must be free, informed and express, and may be obtained orally.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*favourable opinion from a CPP ;\n*no authorisation from the Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament (ANSM), but information (summary and opinion of the CPP sent);\n*insurance taken out by the sponsor;\n*CNIL procedures;\n*research registration number (the sponsor must request this from the Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament);\n*be part of the list established by the Order of 12 April 2018.\n\nResearch in the second category involves healthy or sick people. The minimal nature of the risks and constraints associated with carrying out the procedure(s) is assessed in the light of :\n\n*gender\n*age\n*physical condition\n*the pathology, if any, of the person undergoing the research;\n*frequency and duration.\n\nSuch research may involve the use of health products, but these are then used under the usual conditions of use. It may involve minimally invasive procedures (venous blood sampling, non-invasive imaging, etc.).\n\n===3rd category: non-interventional research===\nNon-interventional research involves no risks or constraints. All procedures are carried out and all products are used in the usual way.\n\nThe subject must be informed and his or her non-opposition must be sought.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*favourable opinion from a CPP ;\n*no authorisation from the ANSM but information (summary and CPP opinion sent);\n*application to the CNIL.\n\n\nThe CPP is involved in all types of research, and its opinion must be favourable for all three types.\n\nThe territorial jurisdiction of the CPPs has been abolished, and the CPPs come under the supervision of a National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person, which is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and assessing the practices of the CPPs.  The CPP will make its decision within forty-five days. If the CPP remains silent after this period, the application is rejected.\n\nResearch involving retrospective data (e.g. theses on medical files) is excluded from this framework as it does not concern individuals but data. Such research is subject solely to the opinion of the CNIL, which is based on a prior opinion from the Comit\u00e9 d'expertise pour les recherches, les \u00e9tudes et les \u00e9valuations dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 (CEREES).\n\nThe different players\n\n*The French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM):\n**is responsible for the methodology of first category trials (after implementation of the BR),\n**issues a registration number for the first, second and third categories of research. Please note: the EUDRACT number for interventional research involving a medicinal product is provided by the European Medicines Agency, the ID-RCB number is provided by the ANSM for all other research,\n**receives the summary and the opinion of the CPP for second and third category research.\n\n*The National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person (CNRIPH), created in 2018, is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and evaluating the practices of the CPPs.\n*The Committee for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) is made up of fourteen full members divided into two colleges.\n*The promoter is the natural person or legal entity responsible for research involving human subjects, who manages the project and ensures that it is financed. The sponsor or its legal representative must be established in the European Union. The sponsor is usually a pharmaceutical laboratory, a research centre or a health establishment such as a university hospital.\n*The investigator is the natural person(s) who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a site. This is most often a doctor.\n\n==Ethical issues==\nDespite the strict normative framework for research, unpredictable situations, harmful effects and unethical drifts can still be observed.\n\nThe principle of protecting vulnerable populations can have a paradoxical effect by excluding these populations from clinical trials, and therefore denying them access to new therapies. In this case, equity in access to care is not respected.\n\nIn some studies, the adverse effect, which had not been observed in animals, causes significant damage in human subjects because it is specific to humans. This unpredictable adverse effect occurs even though the research has been properly conducted following a test in animals.\n\nHow can we be sure that informed consent is genuine when the subject is illiterate or does not understand the language, when the subject is a child or when the subject is incapable of giving consent? What is the value of the consent obtained? There can be no remuneration, but expenses may be reimbursed. Is there any form of control in this case? When the products studied are marketed, will their cost guarantee fair access for all? What will be the accessibility of the product for subjects who wanted to or had to withdraw from the study?\n\nMany questions remain, despite all the attention paid to subjects suitable for biomedical research.\n\n\nKey points\n\n*Research involving human subjects is subject to strict legal supervision. This framework is essential to enable research to develop while respecting individuals.\n*Since 2012, there has been a single legislative framework for all research involving humans. Research is classified into three types depending on whether or not it is interventional and on the risk involved.\n*The roles of the players involved in a research protocol are well defined (investigator, sponsor).\n*The personal protection committees play an important role and provide a decision-making opinion.\n*The competent authority is the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines.",

Atelectasis can also be passive (pulmonary collapse on contact with a pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome, for example) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).\n\nAtelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by ''a direct sign and indirect signs''.\n\n#Direct sign'': opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity has the following characteristics\n#*Systematised with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.\n#*No aeriform bronchogram.\n#Indirect signs: corresponding to the consequences of the reduction in volume of the affected area.\n#*Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma\n#*Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart and hilum\n#*Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome\n#*Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories\n\nChest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to \"specify the site of the obstruction\" (endoluminal, wall or extrinsic) \"and its nature\" (foreign body, tumour, etc.).\n\n\n'''Example of parenchymal atelectasis on chest X-ray (Figures 1-3):'''\n\n(NB: TDM images are provided for illustrative purposes)<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Atel1.JPG|'''Figure 1'''.

Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.\n\nWhen the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.\n\nThe classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:\n\n- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)\n\n- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)\n\n- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)\n\n- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in \"looking for associated lesions\": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",

The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.\n\n=== '''Epidemiology''' ===\nThe main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex and a family history of AAA.\n\nAAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs).\n\nThe prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.\n\n=== '''Natural history''' ===\nThe diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be \"fast-growing\" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year.\n\nThe risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm.\n\nFor the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.\n\n=== '''Other aneurysmal locations''' ===\n\n==== Popliteal artery aneurysms ====\nAAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, but most often in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases).\n\nA popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived) or during ultrasound exploration (for example during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia or, more rarely, stress ischaemia.\n\nThe main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high.\n\nRarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis.\n\nRupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.\n\n==== Aneurysms of the iliac or femoral arteries ====\nMore rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.\n\n==== Thoracic aortic aneurysms ====\nAAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",

It can be carried out with sperm from a spouse ('''IAC'') or from a donor ('''IAD'').\n\nInsemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to obtain maturation of one to three follicles, or induction of ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders ([[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|Menstrual Cycle Disorders]]: anovulation or dysovulation).  \n\nPelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation. This is known as ovulation monitoring.\n\nOvulation is triggered by injection of recombinant hCG to synchronise ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition.\n\nThe day after the induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory, under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected (similar to the migration-survival test, see LISA sheet for item 38). The sperm preparation is inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.            \n\n*In Vitro Fertilisation''''' conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.\n\n<u>Ovarian stimulation</u> under supervision (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) by administration of high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked at the same time by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n\nThese protocols require ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH and progesterone levels). The aim of this monitoring is to :\n\n*check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing),\n*choose the optimum day for ovulation induction,\n*identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g. insufficient ovarian response).\n\nOvulation is triggered when several follicles have reached a size greater than 16 mm by injection of either an hCG analogue (recombinant hCG) or a GnRH agonist.\n\n<u>Follicular puncture</u> (of the follicular fluid) is performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anaesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory where it is examined for cumulo-ovocyte complexes.\n\n<u>Sperm preparation</u> is carried out in the majority of cases using a '''sperm sample taken by masturbation'' on the day of the follicular puncture. However, it is also possible to use frozen sperm from a spouse or a third-party donor. It is also possible to use sperm taken surgically (either from testicular tissue (testicular biopsy) or from the liquid in the epididymis (epididymal puncture)) in cases of azoospermia (sperm which will then be used fresh or after freezing). Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinised urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). The spermatozoa recovered are prepared according to the \"in vitro\" fertilisation technique envisaged.\n\n<u>Fertilisation</u> is either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).\n\n<u>Culture and embryo transfer</u>: after fertilisation of the oocytes by sperm, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on a number of factors.\n\nA pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.\n\n<u>Embryo freezing</u>: non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and then kept in storage tanks containing liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are first thawed and then transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.\n\n\nThe MPA can be :\n\n*intra-marital'' (using the gametes, oocytes and spermatozoa of both members of the couple)\n*or with the intervention of a ''third party donor'' (sperm donor, oocyte donor or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure and for which the couple no longer have any parental plans).\n\nDouble gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible (French Bioethics Act 2021).\n\nPGM can be carried out in the context of \"viral risk\" (HIV, hepatitis B and/or C) in centres approved for this activity. Finally, one of the techniques used in MAP is \"pre-implantation diagnosis\" (PGD), the aim of which is to diagnose genetic anomalies (genes, chromosomes) in embryonic cells. Only a few AMP centres are authorised to carry out PGD in France.\n\n<br />",

Knowing the definition of unreasonable obstinacy and therapeutic prolongation, the need to respect the wishes of the patient, the need to work to relieve pain and suffering, sedation. Understand the concepts of limiting and stopping treatment. Distinguish between treatment and care. Know the definition of palliative care.\n|Rubrique=Management\n|Contributors=C\u00e9line Lef\u00e8ve\n|Ordre=18}}The L\u00e9onetti law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life and the Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law of 2 February 2016 aim to improve care for patients at the end of life. The issue here for medicine is not to initiate or prolong active therapies, but to know how to withdraw in order to maintain only so-called palliative care, which can go as far as deep and continuous sedation until death. These laws have thus provided a framework for the possibility (at the request of the patient or next of kin) or even the obligation (for the doctor, and in dialogue with the patient or family) to stop medical treatments that are disproportionate or only contribute to maintaining vital functions, while maintaining care that preserves the patient's dignity.\n\nThese laws are part of a profound social and legal movement dating from the 1970s-1980s aimed at promoting patient autonomy and, in particular, giving patients the means to communicate their wishes regarding the end of life. This movement can be explained by advances in medical technology, which now make it possible to prolong life long after patients have lost the ability to express themselves. Artificial respiration, nutrition and circulation can be provided before or during the end of life. Around 70% of the French population die in hospital.\n\n# The right to support at the end of one's life and to refuse unreasonable obstinacy\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law states that everyone has the right to ''access to palliative care and support at the end of life'': ''Everyone has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible relief of suffering. Healthcare professionals will do everything in their power to ensure that this right is respected. \"Everyone has the right to receive treatment and care designed to relieve their suffering. In all circumstances, this suffering must be prevented, taken into account, assessed and treated.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law reaffirms \"the patient's right to refuse or interrupt treatment\" or an investigation and prescribes the continuation of his or her follow-up, in particular palliative care. \"If, by refusing or interrupting treatment, the patient's life is endangered, he or she must reiterate this decision within a reasonable time. They may call on another member of the medical profession. It imposes an obligation on the doctor to respect the person's wishes, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness, to refuse or not to receive treatment.\n\nThe 2016 law enshrines '''the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy'''<nowiki>: \"When they appear unnecessary, disproportionate or when they have no effect other than the sole artificial maintenance of life, [treatment] may be suspended or not be undertaken, in accordance with the patient's wishes and, if the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation.\"</nowiki>\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: ''limiting care'' and ''stopping care''. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy. In the case of limitation, the aim is to refrain from implementing measures likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. It means not undertaking certain prolongation treatments that are technically possible, but without the aim of improving the patient's condition. Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment involves the suspension of vital treatment in progress, such as artificial respiration.\n\nThe 2016 law confirmed that artificial nutrition and hydration should be considered as \"treatments\" like any others, and may be suspended provided that the patient has, either directly or indirectly (via advance directives, for example), expressed his or her wish not to continue them. If this is the case, patients should be reassured that they will be comfortable and will not feel thirsty (thanks to the vigilance of the care teams, who will offer regular mouth care) or hungry.\n\nFor people who are not capable of expressing themselves, no decision to limit treatment may be taken by the doctor without first convening a collegial procedure, the aim of which will be to ascertain the patient's wishes as they may have expressed them previously. This procedure requires a meeting to be held within the healthcare department with all the healthcare professionals familiar with the situation. A second medical opinion must also be given during this collegial procedure. Next, the doctor in charge of the patient must consult the patient's advance directives, or, failing that, the trusted support person and, failing that, the family or close friends. Finally, it is the doctor in charge of the patient who will decide whether or not to stop treatment, having been informed of the patient's wishes.\n\n# The right to deep and continuous sedation\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law affirms the right to benefit from ''deep and continuous sedation until death when the vital prognosis is engaged in the short term'': ''At the patient's request to avoid all suffering and not to undergo unreasonable obstinacy, deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration of consciousness maintained until death, associated with analgesia and the cessation of all life-sustaining treatments'' is possible in cases that the legislator specifies: \"1\u00b0 When a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease whose vital prognosis is at risk in the short term is suffering in a way that is refractory to treatment; 2\u00b0 When the decision of a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease to stop treatment is at risk in the short term and is likely to cause unbearable suffering. When the patient is unable to express his or her wishes and, as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy referred to in Article L. 1110-5-1, in the event that the doctor stops life-sustaining treatment, the doctor shall apply deep and continuous sedation causing altered consciousness that is maintained until death, combined with analgesia\".\n\nA refractory symptom is defined as one which is unbearably perceptible and which cannot be relieved despite obstinate efforts to find a suitable therapeutic protocol without compromising the patient's consciousness.\n\nDeep and continuous sedation is based on the \"double effect argument\": \"The physician implements all analgesic and sedative treatments to respond to the refractory suffering of the patient in an advanced or terminal phase, even if they may have the effect of shortening life\". To clarify the distinction between acting and refraining from acting, and between acting and ceasing to act, we can refer to the intentions of the agent: the intention to cause death, which constitutes \"active\" euthanasia, differs from the intention of the person who refrains from continuing a treatment deemed unnecessary or harmful, and therefore excessive, a situation of unreasonable, disproportionate obstinacy, known as \"therapeutic overkill\", and condemned by the principle of non-maleficence. This distinction means that the term \"euthanasia\" is reserved for the \"active\", full, deliberate intention to end a life, an act that is criminal according to the law and reprobated by traditional medical ethics, which are still upheld by medical institutions and authorities. And room is made for the possible legitimacy, in certain circumstances, of an act which, even if it shortens life, no longer fights against an inescapable death and aims \"first and foremost\" to relieve suffering, and will no longer be qualified as euthanasia for this reason.  The main justification for drawing a line between euthanasia and non-euthanasia is to distinguish the intended effect of an act from its foreseeable but unintended side-effects. This is the \"double effect\" argument that inspired the 2005 law on the end of life, revised in 2016. According to this argument, the undesirable, \"bad\" consequences of an action that is considered to be primarily \"good\" do not necessarily prevent that action from being taken. For example, it is possible to relieve the suffering of an incurable patient at the end of life, even if the intensive administration of painkillers hastened the patient's death. The spirit of the principle of double effect is to say that while we can never will evil, even for the sake of a good, we can nevertheless will a good even if the result is evil, when the aim of this good is deemed to take priority. The aim of the primary good is imposed despite the evil that will be its effect. The advantage is to get out of a moral conflict between opposing duties: to relieve suffering, to protect life. In this way, we can say that there is no such thing as \"euthanasia\" because the desire is in no way to cause death, but to relieve a sick person in a proportionate way. Death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid suffering in the final moments. Monotheistic religions therefore accept the relief of suffering at the end of life, even if life is shortened. Thanks to the double effect argument, the principle of respect for life can be made more flexible and become compatible with a concern for quality of life.\n\n# Respecting the wishes of people at the end of their lives\n\nThe option for patients to write down their advance directives, i.e. their wishes regarding \"the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures\", has existed since the 2005 law. The main new feature of the 2016 law is that it is now binding.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law provides for \"advance directives and the designation of a trusted support person\" to enable people who are no longer able to express their wishes to have their rights recognised. Advance directives become the preferred expression of the wishes of patients who are no longer able to express themselves. \"Any person of legal age may draw up advance directives in the event that they are one day unable to express their wishes. These advance directives express the wishes of the person in relation to the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures. \"They may be revised and revoked at any time and by any means.\n\nAdvance directives are now ''binding'' on doctors. \"When a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is unable to express his wishes, the doctor is obliged to enquire about the expression of the patient's wishes. In the absence of the advance directives referred to in article L. 1111-11, the doctor shall obtain the testimony of the trusted support person or, failing this, any other testimony from the family or close friends\". \"Advance directives are binding on the doctor for any decision to carry out an investigation, intervention or treatment, except in the event of a life-threatening emergency, for the time necessary for a full assessment of the situation, and when the advance directives appear manifestly inappropriate or not in keeping with the medical situation\". Some people, including palliative care professionals, stress the variability of wishes and, consequently, the difficulty of interpreting and applying advance directives drawn up in previous circumstances that are far removed from the current end-of-life situation. \"The decision to refuse to apply advance directives that the doctor deems to be manifestly inappropriate or inconsistent with the patient's medical situation is taken at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation and is recorded in the medical record. It is brought to the attention of the trusted support person designated by the patient or, failing that, to the attention of the family or close friends.\n\nThe \"trusted support person\" \"may be a relative, a close friend or the doctor treating the patient\". \"His/her testimony prevails over any other testimony. This designation is made in writing and co-signed by the designated person. It may be reviewed and revoked at any time.\n\nConclusion. Fortunately, the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy limits the will to power that can arise from the implementation of treatments to prolong the life of a person at the end of life, at the cost of objectification, physical and/or moral suffering and disregard for that person's (previous or current) wishes. The right given to people at the end of their lives to ensure that their wishes are respected by means of advance directives rightly reinforces the limits to this abuse.\n\nHowever, the end of life calls for anticipation as much as it resists it. Paradoxically, it is marked by a fear of the future, synonymous with death, and yet by the impossibility of not projecting oneself into the next day, or even the next moment, in the hope of living it as serenely and intensely as possible. From then on, care at the end of life consists of offering, through attentive and solicitous relationships, adaptive, day-to-day support aimed at living in the present, without succumbing to the vain temptation to control the future.\n\n\n''References:''\n\nVan Lander, A.

It is characterised by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.\n\nHorton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) is the cause to be considered first, even though it is not the most common cause, due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered as an \"emergency\". A systematic search should therefore be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease; changes in the temporal arteries; suggestive ocular signs (episode(s) of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography, indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), temporal artery biopsy (this should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralisation and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids as a matter of urgency.\n\nArteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. One or more risk factors are generally present: smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.\n\n=== '''Papilledema''' ===\nThis is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.\n\nIn cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.\n\n=== '''Retro-bulbar optic neuritis (RBON)''' ===\nDamage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.\n\n\nOther causes of optic nerve damage include:\n\n- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: these neuropathies have in common that they are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead), metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).\n\n- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumours or tumours in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n== Damage to the optic chiasm ==\nCompression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as \"chiasmatic syndrome\" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e. a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibres which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.\n\n== Retrochiasmatic disease ==\nThis results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibres travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive haematoma), tumour and trauma.\n\nA sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumour etiology.",

Severe and painful PFP with hearing impairment.\n\n- ENT pathology (mastoiditis, parotitis, parotid tumour): evocative auricular discharge or painful enlargement of the parotid gland ([[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]]).\n\n- Lyme meningo-radiculitis: tick bite in the preceding days or weeks or erythematous plaque. PFP may reveal the infection.\n\n- other bacterial or viral meningoradiculitis (coxsackie, herpes, mumps).\n\n- HIV infection, particularly during seroconversion.\n\n* Brain stem stroke: PFP associated with contralateral hemiplegia of the face (alternating syndrome).\n\n* Multiple sclerosis: importance of a history of previous relapses.\n\n* Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: PFP in the background of a picture dominated by limb involvement. Facial diplegia may occur.\n\n* General inflammatory diseases:\n\n- Sarcoidosis: PFP may inaugurate the disease (most frequent cranial involvement).\n\n- Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome: recurrent PFP, with mucocutaneous infiltration of the face, plicated tongue and family history.\n\n* Tumours: progressive onset, usually affecting other cranial nerves (cerebellopontine angle tumour, trunk glioma, skull base metastasis, carcinomatous meningoradiculitis).

Historically, a living donor had to be the father or mother of the recipient, if possible. However, since 2004, donors may include spouses, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandparents, uncles and aunts, first cousins, as well as the spouse of the father or mother (blended couples). The donor may also be anyone who can prove that they have lived with the recipient for at least two years. It goes without saying that compatibility between donors and recipients must be reliable. In this way, the law keeps pace with changes in society and in medical and social demand.\n\nThe law also provides for the possibility of cross-donation. Cross organ donation involving living donors can take place in a \"chain\" between individuals.  In this way, a patient A can bring a donor B (who is not compatible with A); but this donor B will be used by a patient C who will bring a donor D who will be compatible with patient A.\n\nIn other words, we favour a donation chain between living donors and recipients.\n\nThere is therefore a requirement for considerable coordination and simultaneity between the removal and transplant operations, which means that 4 operating theatres have to be mobilised at the same time for 4 people, for example.\n\nThe law now allows the chain to be extended beyond two 'pairs'.\n\nConsent from living donors must be explicit, free and informed. It is based on a highly codified procedure:\n\n* Information on risks from the doctor: complete, including information on rare and exceptional risks;\n* Reflection period;\n* Opinion of an independent committee of experts, with the subject again being informed by this committee of experts and the freedom to consent assessed;\n* Consent formulated and subsequently recorded before a magistrate (President of the Judicial Court) + intervention of the guardianship judge for protected adults (for whom only marrow donation is authorised).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that donation is prohibited in the case of living donors who are minors or under guardianship or curatorship, with the exception of marrow. In this case, the consent of the parents (holders of parental authority) or legal representative is required, as described above.\n<br />",

In medicine: the questioning of the principles, values and rules governing the actions of practitioners and researchers, with a view to justifying them.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=1}}<br />\n\n=== Meaning and definition of ethics, as distinct from morality and deontology ===\nEthics is the ability of individuals to reflect critically on the moral dimension of their individual and collective actions and practices. It is a reflexive ability that enables people to question the morality of their actions and the relevance of the values, standards and rules that dictate that they should act in a particular way. It is a skill that makes it possible to question morality, because it is both the place where moral standards are produced and the place where they are questioned. Where morality provides answers and restricts freedom, ethics allows us to question our choices, to arbitrate between contradictory moral obligations. Ethics recognises moral pluralism (of values) but also the need to reach agreement beyond this pluralism, through the use of reason and discussion in a democratic context.\n\nThe issues raised in medical practice by developments in science and in our society (patients' rights, access to care, the concept of the family, the use of genetics, gamete and embryo conservation, organ removal, computerisation of medical record data, biomedical research, loss of autonomy, end of life, etc.) require individual and collective reflection to consider the good or bad consequences of decisions and to arbitrate sometimes complex choices in care practices or the organisation of the healthcare system.\n\nToday, every decision involves a multidisciplinary balancing act between medical scientific data, the rights of individuals (personal protection, information, consent), individual desires, collective values and norms and the economic constraints that guide our society.\n\nThe ethical approach aims to organise the way in which decisions are taken in each situation, taking into account these different and sometimes contradictory elements. Ethics is therefore not a value judgement (like morality, which prescribes or forbids), or a code of good practice often linked to legal rules (like deontology), but a process of reflection and analysis to help decision-making. These distinctions are important. Morality reflects the state of thinking in a society (or part of a society) at a given time or reflects a dogma. It derives from a set of principles that determine what is good in Aristotle's sense: it is normative, approves or disapproves, rewards or punishes. Deontology brings together, within a code, the rules of good professional practice that mark out the relationship between carer and patient. It defines a framework for professional responsibility and derives from principles derived from the Hippocratic Oath and from legislation governing medical practice. The law, for its part, encompasses all the rules that govern our society, and the obligations and duties of each individual. When applied to the healthcare and public health system, we speak of health law. It stems from numerous legislative texts (law on patients' rights, bioethics laws, laws organising the healthcare system, etc.) and is set out in codes (Public Health Code, Civil Code, Criminal Code). It is designed to manage conflicts and impose penalties and compensation. It is enforced by the courts. Ethics and law are closely intertwined and may evolve over time. Ethics, on the other hand, is an approach. Its aim is to re-examine moral principles and deontological and legal rules, particularly when they do not provide answers in line with the wishes of the people concerned, or when the situation in question cannot be resolved. Ethics is thus the result of active, collective, interactive reflection on human values and on the tensions between wills and other logics. It studies values, tensions, criteria for choice and the various possible scenarios. It works through argument and debate. In medical practice, it is essential because it helps to guide choices towards concrete decisions that primarily concern a single person: the patient.\n\nAs a way of questioning how we should act, ethics is above all a multi-disciplinary reflection, in the sense that all the human sciences, law, health sciences and care professionals participate in the construction of the reflection by their varied contributions concerning the individual as well as society and its institutions. This is why ethics is not, in the strict sense of the term, a science. It is not the subject of positive knowledge, nor does it result simply from the study of facts and behaviour. Such a study, while of real interest, is not enough to establish values; describing and explaining what is is not enough to define what should be.\n\n=== Ethics of responsibility and applied ethics ===\nIn the ethics of responsibility, the idea is to go further by feeling responsible for all the consequences of our actions, with in particular the need for a critical analysis of a rule or a decision if they are not accepted by all or are not suitable for all, \"a fortiori\" if we know that they may have harmful consequences for the equilibrium of a person or a group of people. In this way, the ethics of responsibility leads to a willingness to act not by making automatic choices, but each time in a singular and reasoned way, in favour of a consequentialist approach.\n\nThis means maximising knowledge of the consequences of choices and actions. So, as the objective of responsibility demands, all anticipatory ethics becomes a branch of research with an obligation for collective analysis that should be cultivated by encouraging the cooperation of many experts in the most diverse fields, most often inviting a cross-disciplinary approach. But there is also a need for debate with the people affected, patients and, more broadly, the general public. So any decision involving the future of one or more people, or \"a fortiori\" everyone, needs to be at the heart of an approach that looks at future consequences, sharing information on benefits, doubts, uncertainties and risks. Any practice that involves risk or uncertainty, or that may call into question a particular human value, must be debated.\n\nThis approach is fully applicable to the medical field. Given the many upheavals that medicine has brought about in the course of our lives and in the organisation of society (quality of life, the future of the individual, disability, death, suffering, procreation, screening and prediction, etc.), the question of biopower over individuals has been raised, and today medical risks and practices are under the microscope.\n\nIf we want to promote a democratic approach to health issues and encourage people's freedom and responsibility in this area, we need to link medical progress with recognition of social expectations. This link is particularly important when dealing with practices that have a major impact on people's lives, especially if the benefits are debated and/or there are risks involved.\n\nThis is why ethics in healthcare is intended to be practical and operational, i.e. ethics that are not just conceptual, but that lead to advice to guide action and choices. This is why we speak of applied ethics.\n\nApplied ethics is based either on descriptive analyses of cases, or on surveys of situations, or on sociological or ethno-medical studies. On the one hand, it proposes the analysis of professional practices, with the aim of addressing the attitudes and behaviour of all those involved when faced with a problematic situation, and on the other, an argument on the consequences of the various possible choices. When it applies to specific cases, it is referred to as 'micro-ethics', and when it concerns societal choices or healthcare policies, it is referred to as 'macro-ethics'. Applied ethics aims to guide decision-making.",

Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and <u>formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min</u>. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n* Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (sulphonylureas): Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc). They are associated with '''glinides''' (<u>repaglinide</u>) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: <u>hypoglycaemia</u> and weight gain [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics variable depending on the molecule and <u>therefore variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides</u>. <u>No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.</u>\n\n* '''Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (colloquially DPP4, family: \"gliptins\").''' Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). <u>Posology to be adjusted to renal function.</u> Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.\n\n* '''GLP1 receptor agonists (colloquially GLP1 agonists).''' Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. <Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia.</u> Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.\n\n* '''Intestinal alphaglucosidase inhibitor,''' only representative: <u>acarbose</u>. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.\n\n* '''SGLT2 inhibitors.''' Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. <u>Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects [[Adult heart failure]] [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]</u>. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation.

Tremor==\nInvoluntary rhythmic oscillation of all or part of the body around its position of equilibrium. There are two main types of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]]: those which occur in muscles at rest and those which occur in activated muscles (i.e. in action) with postural and intentional components often associated.\n<br />\n\n==B. Chorea==\nSudden, random, anarchic movement, often of the rotation or flexion/extension type, non-stereotyped, arrhythmic, without purpose, affecting various territories (face, neck, trunk, limbs), present at rest and in action, occurring against a background of hypotonia.\n\nWhen this type of movement is proximal (affecting the roots of the limbs) and has a large amplitude, we speak of ballismus (most often linked to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus).\n\n==C.  Dystonia==\nInvoluntary, prolonged muscle contractions responsible for abnormal posture and/or repetitive movements, aggravated by movements in the vicinity of the affected area and stereotyped. It may therefore involve abnormal posture and/or movement. Dystonia is therefore a cause of [[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|localised or generalised muscle contracture]] which can give the impression of [[Joint stiffness SD-056|joint stiffness]].\n\nFocal dystonia: a segment of the body is affected as in spasmodic torticollis (also known as cervical dystonia, characterised by torsion of the neck), blepharospasm (focal dystonia responsible for [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|palpebral anomaly]]) linked to dystonia of the orbicular muscles of the eyelids and characterised by abnormal, iterative and prolonged occlusions of the eyelids.\n\nFunctional dystonia: dystonia occurs during a particular gesture or function (e.g. writer's cramp, musician's cramp).\n\nHaemidonia: damage to one of the hemi-bodies.\n\nGeneralised dystonia: involvement of at least one lower limb and the trunk.\n<br />\n\n==D. Myoclonus==\nSudden muscle jerks originating in the central nervous system. They may be segmental (focal or multifocal) or generalised, isolated (arrhythmic) or repetitive (rhythmic, giving the impression of an irregular tremor). These muscular jerks are positive myoclonias, whereas negative myoclonias are sudden resolutions of muscle tone (as in asterixis or \"flapping tremor\"). Myoclonus may be cortical, subcortical (linked to dysfunction of the basal ganglia), reticular, pontine or spinal in origin.\n\n==E. Tics==\nA tic is a sudden, brief, intermittent, stereotyped movement without purpose (a \"caricature of a normal gesture\"), which is repetitive. It may be preceded by a premonitory sensation (internal sensation of the need to move preceding the tic) and can be controlled by the will for a few minutes at the cost of increasing internal tension and a rebound phenomenon occurring after the control effort. The tic is the most frequent abnormal movement.\n\nThe tic may be simple, involving just a few muscles (blinking, shaking the head, shrugging the shoulders, etc.) or complex, involving an elaborate motor sequence (putting the right hand under the left armpit and adducting the left shoulder to crush the right hand).\n\nMotor tics are the opposite of vocal tics (screaming, sniffing, throat clearing, forced exhalation, etc.) which may, rarely, correspond to obscenities known as coprolalia.\n\n==F.

The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to think of it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process the patient is given information so that, on the one hand, she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure and, on the other, once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for a variety of reasons ranging from the material difficulties encountered by families (identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult carrying trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",

It is cosmopolitan, but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebosis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebosis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues (by vegetative forms of \"Entamoeba histolytica histolytica\").\n\n'''<u>Cryptosporidiosis</u>''''\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhoea, and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.\n\n'''<u>Giardiasis</u>''''\n\nGiardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhoea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.\n\n'''<u>Toxoplasmosis</u>''''\n\nToxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat faeces, and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases, and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",

All fertility preservation techniques are currently reimbursed at 100% by the French Assurance Maladie, in accordance with the conditions set out above.\n\n\nIt should be noted that MAP treatment and recourse to fertility preservation are carried out after \"multidisciplinary consultation\" between the doctors and reproductive biologists of the MAP centre carrying out the procedure.\n\n<br />",

They are useful for confirming the nerve lesion and its aetiology, depending on the clinical context.\n\n- The ''DN4'' questionnaire (neuropathic pain in 4 questions) ''differentiates DN from nociceptive pain'' with excellent sensitivity and specificity (> 80%) for a score \u2265 4 out of 10 (Fig 1) and \u2265 3 out of 7 for its ''questioning'' version (without clinical examination) which can be completed by a non-health worker or the patient.\n\n<u>Fig. 1 : Diagnostic questionnaire DN4</u> ''' ''''\n\nAccording to Bouhassira et al Pain 2005\n\n<br /><gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Pain2005.png\n</gallery>",

Our bodies can be seen or touched by others, but only we can experience them from the inside. We therefore have a different perception of our own body and the bodies of others. This difference is exacerbated in the case of patients, who experience the unique nature of an illness in their own bodies, and can be a source of dissension between carers and patients. Carers, being healthy, tend to see illness as a physical phenomenon requiring medical intervention, whereas for patients the experience of illness has an impact on their whole life. The patient's experience of illness triggers a search for meaning and gives rise to feelings (shame, fear) or behaviours (blame) that considerably increase their suffering.\n\nBy analysing the experience of pain, we can understand how illness alters our experience of the body.\n\nPain is not just a physiological fact; it is first and foremost a fact of existence. It is not the body that suffers, but the whole individual, in terms of the meaning and value of his or her life. Pain thus affects the sense of identity. People no longer recognise themselves for who they were. The people around them change their behaviour towards them. For better or for worse, pain profoundly transforms the person affected by it. It is not confined to an organ or a function; it is also moral. Toothache is not just in the tooth, it affects every aspect of a person's life.",

These cases and controls can be re-contacted to collect data retrospectively on more specific exposures that were not collected prospectively as part of the cohort, without having to re-contact all the subjects in the initial cohort.\n\n'''Case-cohort study''': From an existing cohort, a sample called the ''sub-cohort'' is selected at random (i.e. representative of the entire cohort). All the incident 'cases' in the cohort (all the individuals who have experienced the event of interest, whether or not from the sub-cohort) are selected and compared with the 'non-cases' in the sub-cohort only. This scheme is used in particular when the study requires additional data to be collected. In order to avoid collecting data on the entire initial cohort, only cases (from the entire cohort) and \"non-cases\" (from the sub-cohort) are collected. For example: association between a genetic anomaly and the occurrence of cancer (the genetic anomaly will only be measured in cancer cases and non-cases in the sub-cohort).\n\n'''Quasi-experimental study''': we speak of quasi-experimental studies when the objective is to evaluate the effect on a judgment criterion of an experimental intervention, conducted on an individual or population scale, i.e. administered to all or some of the subjects in a population or sample as part of a study, <u>outside a randomised trial.</u> In practice:\n\n* <u>No control group,</u> for example in:\n** a '''repeated cross-sectional before/after survey'' design of an intervention conducted on an experimental basis in a population in order to compare the prevalence of the event of interest between the two periods.

This is the case when we have a registration system which lists all the subjects who have developed the event of interest during a given period in a given population (e.g. cancer registry, notifiable diseases, etc. see [[Data collection 2C-020-DE-B05]]). To estimate the frequency of the event of interest in this population, we can use census data, for example, which will give us the total size of the population over the period for the denominator. These frequencies can be compared between several populations or over time. When different recording systems are available to estimate the frequency of the event of interest and that of exposure factors in groups of subjects, it is also possible to compare the joint changes in these frequencies over time or space. Example: estimate changes in the age- and sex-standardised cancer incidence rate in France between 1990 and 2020 using cancer registries, compare these incidence rates between different regions, study the correlation between changes in these incidence rates and changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption over the same period.",

For a long time, death was recognised through the inanimate or cold corpse. Then came the notion of death due to cardiac arrest and then encephalic death.\n\nIn 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined this new definition of death as encephalic death, but it was not officially recognised until 1968 in the circular legalising the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the so-called Jeanneney circular).\n\nIt can therefore be said that today there are two ways of being dead, as stated in \"Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes and amending the Public Health Code\".)\n\n# Patient in cardiac arrest (clinical criteria) :\n#* Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation;\n#* Abolition of all brain stem reflexes;\n#* Absence of spontaneous ventilation;\n#* In this case samples must be taken rapidly.\n# Patient in a state of encephalic death:\n#* No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test;\n#* Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation;\n#* In these cases, sampling may be deferred and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state in order to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.\n\nIn this context, it is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:\n\n* people in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I);\n* people in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II);\n* people for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment because of the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III);\n* people who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).\n\nEncephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. In addition, the general public fears that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. So we need to be very clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. We need to listen, explain and support them. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels on this subject: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.\n\n\n'''A special case: organ donation and the medico-legal obstacle'''\n\n* If there is a \"medico-legal obstacle\" at the time of death... this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.\n* BUT :\n** Agreement of the Public Prosecutor+++ (role of the forensic pathologist+++) / The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.\n** The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.\n** The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",

Patients may claim that one of their rights has been infringed in order to hold a doctor or healthcare establishment liable. However, the onus is on the patient to prove fault. Article L.1142-1 of the French Public Health Code stipulates that health professionals and establishments are only liable for the harmful consequences of preventive, preventive or therapeutic acts if they are at fault.\n\n'''Patients' rights'''\n\nInfringement of one of these rights may give rise to medical liability for negligence:\n\n- right to health protection ;\n\n- right to respect for dignity ;\n\n- the right not to be discriminated against in access to prevention or care;\n\n- right to privacy and confidentiality of information ;\n\n- the right to receive the most appropriate treatment and care and to benefit from therapies whose effectiveness is recognised and which guarantee the best possible health safety and relief of suffering in the light of proven medical knowledge;\n\n- the right not to be subjected to acts of unreasonable obstinacy ;\n\n- the right to deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration in consciousness maintained until death ;\n\n- the right to receive treatment and care to relieve suffering ;\n\n- right of access to palliative care and support ;\n\n- the right to be informed about your state of health ;\n\n-the right to information on the costs to which the user may be exposed in the course of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic activities;\n\n- the right to refuse or not to receive treatment\n\n\nThe event giving rise to liability must therefore be a proven fault. This fault can take different forms and is usually distinguished as follows:\n\n- technical negligence, which consists of a breach of established medical knowledge or scientific data. This proven medical knowledge constitutes a technical standard to which the judge refers, and may be defined by reference to scientific medical literature and recommendations of good practice. The judge must refer to proven medical knowledge at the time of the disputed medical act;\n\n- breach of a duty of humanism, which refers to the \"human\" dimension of medical practice, and may result in particular from a breach of professional secrecy or a lack of information that does not allow free and informed consent.\n\nIn some cases, the triggering event may take other forms: it may be the defect of a health product, the product being considered defective when it does not offer the safety that can legitimately be expected.",

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n'''Knowledge of pain assessment tools and scales for communicating and non-communicating adults'''\n\n'''General principles'''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several sites of pain, each site should be assessed separately.\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (French version: questionnaire douleur de Saint Antoine), which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|-\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\nThis generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient, there is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).\n\n <gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:EVA adults.png\n</gallery>\n\n*Adult EVA\n\n<br /><gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Eva vertical.png\n</gallery>\n\n*\n\n Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less co-operative patients (asthenia, fatigability).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| No\n         pain\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|10\n|Pain\nmaximum\n|}\n'''The Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (or categorical scale)'''\n\nAimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones.\n\nIncludes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question \"are you in pain\"?\n|}\n'''Pain hetero-assessment scales''''\n\n- They are aimed at patients with ''verbal communication disorders''.\n\n- They require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behaviour and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioural scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently used in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, interruption of movement, etc.\n\nusual activities.\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds imply that clinicians should consider the search for the cause of the pain and its treatment.\n\n<br />",

As it has grown, it has been extended to cover groups of people, such as students, the unemployed and government contract workers, who are not employed in the private sector. France has chosen to achieve universal conversion of the population, whether or not they contribute to the financing of social security.\n\nThe general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), i.e. those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nSince 2018 and the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed (tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers and the non-regulated liberal professions).\n\n\n'''Organization'''\n\nSince the \"Jeanneney\" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organisation of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.\n\nThree of these branches cover one or more risks:\n\nhe Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It is responsible for supporting families in their day-to-day lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability;\n\nThe Sickness, Occupational Injuries and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers two types of risk: sickness, maternity, disability and death, and accidents at work and occupational diseases;\n\n'''the Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.'''\n\nIn addition, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a ''fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability''. This new branch will be managed by the Caisse nationale de solidarit\u00e9 pour l'autonomie (CNSA).\n\nTwo other branches carry out common, cross-functional tasks:\n\nthe social security contribution collection branch is managed by the Urssaf Caisse nationale (the new name, since 2021, of the Agence centrale des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale - Acoss). It collects the resources allocated to the other branches of social security (i.e. it collects the social security contributions - employer's and employee's - paid by employers), through the intermediary of local offices - the Urssaf;\n\nthe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des employeurs du R\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale is managed by the Union des caisses nationales de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (UCANSS).

The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.\n\n\nThe two most frequent locations are :\n\n- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease.\n\nAppears most frequently around the age of 9-10.\n\n- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease.\n\nA common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.\n\n\nThese pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localised in the growth plate. X-rays may be used to complete the assessment.\n\nTreatment consists of a period of sports rest. Only the most severe cases require immobilisation and offloading.\n\nHomolateral or contralateral recurrences are frequent.",

It is accompanied by intense pruritus and manifests itself in the form of eczematous or urticarial lesions covered with tense bullae. Lesions are localised to the roots and flexural surfaces of the limbs; the head, neck and mucous membranes are spared. Biologically, there is a blood hypereosinophilia.\n\n\nPemphigus vulgaris affects people aged around 45 and manifests itself as painful erosions of the oral mucosa and other mucous membranes (genital, anal, nasal, conjunctival). Secondarily, there may be cutaneous bullae on non-inflammatory skin and a Nikolsky's sign. It may be drug-induced or associated with another autoimmune disease. In superficial pemphigus, there are no mucosal lesions but only squamous-crusty or even keratotic skin lesions.\n\nHistologically, a subepidermal bulla with an infiltrate of eosinophilic polynuclear cells is found in bullous pemphigoid, and an intraepidermal bulla with acantholysis (detachment of keratinocytes) in pemphigus vulgaris.\n\nIn direct immunofluorescence, there is a linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction in bullous pemphigoid and a deposition of IgG and C3 on the surface of keratinocytes in pemphigus (inter-cellular or mesh marking).\n\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence shows that circulating antibodies recognising the dermo-epidermal junction are present at high titre in bullous pemphigoid and circulating antibodies recognising the intercellular substance in pemphigus.\n\nIn ELISA, these circulating antibodies recognise the following target antigens: BP180 and BP230 proteins in bullous pemphigoid, desmoglein 3 in pemphigus vulgaris and desmoglein 1 in superficial pemphigus.",

I will respect all persons (...) without any discrimination according to their condition or beliefs\".\n\nPublic Health Code: health professionals must \"listen to, examine, advise or treat all persons with the same conscience, regardless of their origin, morals or family situation, their membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation or religion, their disability or state of health, their reputation or any feelings they may have towards them...\". (Public Health Code, art. R. 4127-7)\n\nThere are cases in which it may be legitimate to make differences, even on prohibited grounds such as nationality. For example, when recommendations were put in place in 2007 for vaccination against tuberculosis aimed at specific populations (children born in a highly endemic country or whose parents are from that country), the Directorate General for Health asked the Human Rights Defender whether this constituted discrimination. His response was that this targeted health policy did not constitute discrimination, given the public health issues at stake and the proportionate nature of the proposed rules. However, she called for great vigilance to ensure that this measure was not used to monitor the residency status of the target groups.\n\n\n'''Refusal of care as discrimination'''\n\nSituations of refusal of care are situations where certain people are refused treatment simply because, for example, they have a certain socio-administrative status.\n\n''Cas clinique''<ref>''Migration Sant\u00e9 Alsace, \"Vers plus d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9 : guide de pr\u00e9vention et de lutte contre les discriminations\", 2019,'' https://www.migrationssante.org/axes-dintervention/discriminations-et-sante/guide/</ref>'' :'''''Ms B., a patient of Romanian nationality, requested and obtained an appointment with a GP. On the day of the appointment, she was finally refused a consultation. The doctor gave two reasons: (1) the patient was in receipt of State Medical Aid (AME), which made it difficult for the Assurance Maladie to pay her; (2) the patient did not speak or understand French well.''  \n\nInvited to a mediation session following a complaint to the Order by an association accompanying the patient, the doctor was reminded that it is explicitly forbidden to refuse treatment on the grounds of a particular health cover (Article 1110-3 of the Public Health Code). Furthermore, the apprehension of administrative difficulties cannot, in itself, justify refusing care. Lastly, difficulty in communicating does not justify a refusal of care in the first instance. At the very least, a clinical examination is possible. Interpreting resources can be mobilised. In this case, the refusal of care was discriminatory and unlawful.\n\n'''Professional law and harm to individuals'''\n\n<nowiki>Some refusals of care are legitimate: for example, a professional is obliged to refuse care requested when it does not fall within his or her remit. Health professionals may also refuse to provide care, as expressly stated in paragraph 2 of article R. 4127-47 of the French Public Health Code: \"Except in an emergency or where he would lack humanity, a doctor has the right to refuse care for professional or personal reasons.[...]\".</nowiki>\n\nBut in all cases, the act of refusing care cannot be to the detriment of the individual, whose right to health is affirmed by texts of high normative value (the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1976, the European Social Charter of 1961 and 1996, and in France, the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946).\n\n\n'''The reality of discrimination in access to healthcare in France today'''\n\nDiscrimination is difficult to measure and understand. Testing is the most widely used method for establishing the presence of a social phenomenon of discrimination, making it possible to describe differences in treatment by healthcare professionals, for equivalent clinical cases but with distinct socio-cultural variables. A major study was carried out in 2019 on the differences in access to medical appointments in France depending on whether you are eligible for CMU-C (now ACS) or are of African origin. The results highlight strong discrimination based on economic vulnerability, with explicit and direct discriminatory refusals of care for 10 to 15% of the 1,500 professionals contacted. The study also found discrimination based on origin in some regions.\n\nThis study only describes the visible part of the problem:\n\n*Refusal of care is not always explicit and can take more insidious forms: late, unusual and abusive scheduling of an appointment, repeated and abusive referral to another practitioner or to a hospital outpatient department without a stated medical reason, refusal to draw up an estimate, non-compliance with applicable tariffs (except in cases provided for by law), refusal to waive the advance payment of costs for beneficiaries who have complied with the care pathway, etc. (CNAM, 2008, Circulaire CIR-33, \"Prise en charge des r\u00e9clamations et plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\", \"Prise en charge des plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\"). (CNAM, 2008, Circulaire CIR-33, \"Prise en charge des r\u00e9clamations et plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\").\n*Complaints about discriminatory treatment are rare, due to the difficulty of establishing the facts, particularly when they are not direct and explicit, and because the appeal bodies (CPAM, defender of rights, professional order, etc.) are often unknown and difficult to access.\n\n'''Psycho-social mechanisms: stereotypes and prejudice'''\n\nTesting can reveal discriminatory behaviour that becomes visible on a large scale. It does not, however, make it possible to establish discriminatory \"intent\". But for the sociologist interested in understanding discrimination phenomena in all their social dimensions, discrimination is a structural rather than an individual phenomenon, and has real consequences, in particular by producing new inequalities beyond those on which it is based.\n\nFor example, a racist or homophobic act suffered by a person does not simply result in verbal or physical aggression. It is part of a continuum for the person being discriminated against because of their otherness in relation to a stereotyped identity that has become the norm. All social groups have social representations that give them access to a common meaning and a grid for reading experience.\n\nDiscrimination is caused or facilitated by some of these social representations. '''Stereotypes''' are simplifying representations that are relatively rigid and not always of good quality<ref>Jean-Baptiste L\u00e9gal, Sylvain Delouv\u00e9e. ''Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination''. Dunod, 2015.</ref>. A stereotype may be advantageous or disadvantageous, but it is always simplifying. We attribute such and such stereotypical traits to the group as a whole. '''Prejudices''' are preconceived opinions that are generally depreciatory about a group and predispose people to act unfavourably towards its members.\n\n\n'''Labelling patients and prioritising plains'''\n\nBecause of their training, working conditions and professional cultures, doctors use categories to classify and identify patients and their problems. Categorising people or situations in this way saves time in known or perceived situations, or in emergency situations. But categorising or labelling can lead to discrimination. Some labels that are very widespread and seem harmless (\"shrink\", \"CMU patient\" etc.) carry only simplifying connotations. Under no circumstances is their use based on validated scientific knowledge.\n\n''Cas clinique''<ref>''Migration Sant\u00e9 Alsace, \"Vers plus d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9 : guide de pr\u00e9vention et de lutte contre les discriminations\", 2019,'' https://www.migrationssante.org/axes-dintervention/discriminations-et-sante/guide/</ref>'': Mrs R., the daughter of a couple of Iranian nationality, complained of severe pain during childbirth. The midwife told one of her colleagues \"not to worry, that the patient's culture had to be taken into account and that it was a 'Mediterranean syndrome'\". But the patient was in the process of developing a serious complication''.\n\nYou might think that the professional was trying, in all benevolence, to take account of the culture of origin and adapt her care to the individual. However, this \"Mediterranean syndrome\" has no scientific basis. The ways in which pain is expressed vary both within and between cultural groups, and a person's geographical origin is not predictive of the way in which they will express their complaints<ref>Myriam Dergham, Rodolphe Charles, Le \"syndrome m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en\" : une stigmatisation par cat\u00e9gorisation des conduites de maladies, Medecine, volume 16, number 10, December 2020</ref>.\n\nThe use of a \"culturalist\" analysis grid, and therefore of stereotypes, can lead to discrimination, unbeknownst to professionals. It should also be borne in mind that healthcare professionals themselves come from a particular social background. They will therefore be more likely to understand patient signals with which they are familiar.\n\n\n'''Socio-historical mechanisms of discrimination'''\n\nDiscrimination is not only direct and conscious, it can also be indirect and systemic.\n\n*Discrimination primarily affects vulnerable populations, i.e. \"subgroups of the general population which, because of social, economic, historical, political or geographical factors, are exposed to greater risks and are therefore likely to be disadvantaged in terms of their state of health and/or their access to care\"<ref>Frohlich, K.L. and Potvin, L. (2008) Transcending the known in public health practice, the inequality paradox, the population approach and vulnerable populations. American Journal of Public Health, 98, 216-221. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2007.114777</ref>.\n*Discrimination (on the basis of origin, place of residence, gender, age) exists in access to housing, employment, leisure activities, etc. This discrimination itself has an adverse effect on the quality of life. This discrimination itself has an adverse effect on health (social determinants of health). So there are forms of discrimination that do not fall within the field of health, but which nonetheless affect people's health.\n*Finally, discrimination must be linked to social policies. Making access to certain rights more difficult, for example by tightening the conditions for obtaining a residence permit or restricting access to certain social benefits, reinforces inequalities in health. Paradoxically, certain policies that aim more specifically to give the most disadvantaged groups access to healthcare or rights can have the perverse effect of targeting these groups, and thereby stigmatising them.",

The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. There are many other causes: intra-alveolar haemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organised pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.\n\nThe definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:\n\n*pulmonary opacity (denser or \"whiter\" than normal parenchyma)\n*containing images of aerated bronchi (= aerated bronchogram)\n\nThe term \"systemic\" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe (Figure 1). The silhouette sign can help to localise the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term \"retractile\" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, we speak of ''''''athelectasis''.\n\nCT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray, and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary oedema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.<gallery widths=\"700\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Alv1.JPG|'''Figure 1.''' Front chest X-ray showing a systematised opacity of the right upper lobe with a clear stop at the contact of the small scissure (blue arrows).

Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).\n\n'''Attention'''\n\n- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''', '''[[Mental Confusion/Disorientation SD-119|mental Confusion/Disorientation]]''' (which result from severe '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''') and '''[[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and Consciousness Disorder]]'''''\n\n- Attention is necessary for all the major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.\n\n- Tests by repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.\n\n'''Perceptual integration functions'''\n\n- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects and the body schema.\n\n- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe), and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.\n\n- '''Temporal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Aphasia''' ('''[[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]]''') by impairment of comprehension, '''visual agnosia''' (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects (colours or shapes) or more complex ones (faces, manufactured or living objects)\n\no Tests understanding of simple commands (\"close your eyes\"), naming of objects or faces.\n\n- '''Parietal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Apraxia''' (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), '''visual neglect''' '''unilateral''', i.e. inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), '''disturbance of the representation of the body schema'' (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc).\n\no Tested by copying a geometric figure (MMSE image), drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (\"military salute\", \"nose-thumbing\") and gestures involving the use of objects (\"brushing teeth\", \"combing hair\", \"playing the violin\", \"hammering a nail\").\n\n'''Memory'''\n\n- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.) but in the tests, ''episodic memory'' is mainly assessed.\n\n- '''Episodic memory''' :\n\no the ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e. the place, the moment, the emotional state)\n\no the critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or \"consolidation\")\n\no depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the ''hippocampi'' and adjacent cortices.\n\no Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to \"progressive forgetting\" (\"What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?\").\n\n- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.\n\no 1. read five words (\"Museum\", \"Lemonade\", \"Colander\", \"Grasshopper\" and \"Truck\") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (\"What is the drink?\"...).\n\no 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).\n\no 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g. a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.\n\n'''Executive functions'''\n\n- Mental operations enabling the individual to '''understand the context'' of the action, to d''''inhibit automatic or reflexive behaviour'' and to '''generate voluntary behaviour'' directed towards a goal.\n\n- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.\n\n- '''Dysexecutive syndrome''' leads to a lack of contextualisation (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgement and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviours (repetitive and stereotyped ''[<nowiki/>[[Obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour SDD-136|obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour]]]''') and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food ''[<nowiki/>[[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SDD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]]''', disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).\n\n- Tested using the ''rapid frontal efficiency battery'' (BREF)",

It is arbitrarily divided into three compartments, which are often defined as such on a profile X-ray (Figure 1):\n\n*The ''anterior mediastinum'', which contains fatty tissue, the thymus and ganglion chains.\n*The middle mediastinum, which contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.\n*The '''posterior mediastinum''', which contains the descending thoracic aorta, oesophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, lymph node chains\n<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"400\">\nFile:Mediast1.jpg|'''Figure 1.''' Segmentation of the mediastinum illustrated on profile chest radiograph. In blue: anterior mediastinum; in green: middle mediastinum; in yellow: posterior mediastinum.\n</gallery>\n\n\nMediastinal abnormalities may correspond to :\n\n*The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Example: mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumour, paraspinal abscess, bronchogenic cyst, etc.\n*''An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure.'' Example: aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, cardiomegaly.\n*''An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure'' in the mediastinum. Example: intra-thoracic thyroid goitre, hiatal hernia.\n\n\nThe main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are summarised in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Anterior mediastinum\n|Middle mediastinum\n|Posterior mediastinum'''\n|-\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|-\n|Thymic tumours\n|Bronchogenic cysts\n|Neurogenic tumours\n|-\n|Germ Cell Tumours\n|Vascular dilations\n|Oesophageal tumours\n|-\n|Thyroid gland\n|\n|Hiatal hernia\n|-\n|Pleuropericardial cyst\n|\n|\n|}\n\n\nOn a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality ''is characterised by an opacity''.\n\n*A clear external boundary convex towards the lung\n*Gently sloping into the mediastinum\n*Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements\n*Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum\n\n[[File:Bords mediastinaux.jpg|vignette|'''Figure 2.'''

On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava.

This complexity and uncertainty make it difficult to provide information that will enable us to define \"the time that remains\".\n\n- The ethical challenge when it comes to informing patients is to provide honest and clear information, in line with respect for patients' autonomy and their right to be informed about their state of health, as set out in the Kouchner Act of 4 March 2002, by creating the conditions for building a relationship of trust: by being attentive to the person's needs and emotional reactions, by allowing them to express themselves and by taking the time to answer their questions and expectations, by assuring them that healthcare professionals will support them all the way and by laying the foundations for future care.\n\n- Respect for the dignity of the individual as a human being (Kant) - whatever their vulnerability, state of weakness, dependence, ability to express themselves, etc. - and recognition of the common humanity shared by carers and cared for. - and the recognition of the common humanity shared by carers and cared for.\n\n- The relief, in accordance with the principle of beneficence, of a person's pain and suffering. While the two concepts can be distinguished for the purposes of analysis (the term pain can be reserved for affects felt in particular organs of the body or in the body as a whole, and the term suffering for affects that are open to reflexivity, language, the relationship with oneself, with others and to questioning), the two phenomena do interpenetrate, as pain can completely invade subjective experience and affect the relationship with oneself and with others, as well as the person's ability to think, to say and to act (Ricoeur).\n\n- Respect for the person's autonomy, including when they are unable to express themselves. This respect means trying to find out about the person's history, personal identity and, in particular, their own values or preferences, what is important to them and what defines them (which is essential, for example, in deciding where the end of life will take place - at home, in hospital, in a healthcare establishment). This respect for the individual's wishes is reflected in the 2016 Clayes-L\u00e9onetti Act, which requires medical decisions to be made in accordance with the individual's advance directives and the testimony of the trusted support person, or failing that, the person's close relatives.\n\n- Maintaining the person's status as a subject. This involves maintaining the person's involvement in personal relationships, offering relational support to enable them to develop the meaning they need for the end-of-life ordeal and, more broadly, for their existence, and maintaining their self-esteem.\n\n- The issue of respecting the autonomy of people at the end of their lives raises the question of how to take into account their possible request for death and the methods that society defines as acceptable for responding to it. While the demand for death varies according to the stage of the illness, the intensity of pain and suffering and the quality of treatment and care, it can also be ambivalent and in reality mean a demand for presence and care, and it can also persist. Should care at the end of life be limited to accompanying the dying process by relieving the person's suffering through the massive administration of analgesics, even if this means accelerating the moment of death but without intending to bring it about (according to the double effect argument whereby death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid the suffering of the last moments)? Can it consist of providing a person at the end of life, whose suffering cannot be relieved and who expressly and persistently asks to be helped to die, with the means to take his or her own life (assisted suicide)? Or can care consist of actively and deliberately causing death (euthanasia) in response to a person's request?\n\n- The question of the decision-making process, which requires the implementation of an ethics of discussion during collegial and interdisciplinary deliberations. According to the philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas, decisions can be considered morally valid if they are the result of a discussion, i.e. an exchange of arguments that seeks agreement. However, reaching a consensus is no guarantee of the morality of the decision. What is important is that the discussion takes place in such a way as to give meaning to the decisions taken. It is also important that the decision-making process does not aim to apply general rules, but is based on the uniqueness and complexity of the situation.\n\n- The question of equity, i.e. access to appropriate care, in particular palliative care, taking into account the multiple inequalities that can affect people at the end of life (social, cultural, territorial inequalities, linked to their pathology, etc.).\n<br />\n\nReferences:\n\nC.

Medical complications need to be treated early and rehabilitation needs to be started quickly. Rehabilitation can take place in the private sector or in a CAMSP (Centre d'action m\u00e9dico-sociale pr\u00e9coce for 0-6 year olds) then SESSAD (Service d'\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale et de soins \u00e0 domicile, up to the age of 20).\n\nThroughout life, it is important to know how to look for the main complications (see [[Evolution of trisomy 21|2C-045-SP-A01]]) and to treat them in order to avoid, in particular, over-handicap (vision problems, hypoacusis, hypothyroidism).\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 have a margin of progression, which varies from one patient to another and is impossible to predict. They have a psychomotor delay ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|anomaly of psychomotor development]]). For example, walking is acquired on average between 2 and 3 years of age, compared with between 9 and 18 months for a child without Down's syndrome. Language acquisition is often the most delayed, accompanied by speech disorders ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]).\n\nPuberty proceeds normally.\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 are often short (over - 2 DS) ([[Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]) and have a tendency to develop obesity which should be treated by hygienic and dietary measures and by encouraging the practice of sport.\n\nThe majority of children with Down's syndrome are able to recognise words, and even to read, write a few words and count a little, allowing them a degree of independence.\n\nInclusion in the mainstream environment should be encouraged as far as possible, either in normal classes or in adapted classes (ULIS: Unit\u00e9s Localis\u00e9es pour l'Inclusion Scolaire). If the child has reached his or her limits in terms of acquiring school skills, he or she may be admitted to an IME (Institut m\u00e9dico-\u00e9ducatif) or an IMPro (Institut m\u00e9dico-professionnel) to work on independence and learn a trade.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome can be housed (rare). They can work in a mainstream workplace (rare), work in an ESAT (\u00c9tablissement et service d'aide par le travail, the majority), stay with their parents or move into a so-called occupational home.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome usually have an emotional life and some women (rare) have children.\n\nIn adulthood, the question arises of guardianship, curatorship or family administrative supervision to protect these people, particularly financially.\n\nFrom their fifties onwards, people with Down's syndrome begin to experience the complications associated with premature ageing and an increased risk of dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer's type ([[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|memory impairment/cognitive decline]]).\n\nLife expectancy is estimated at 60 years.",

It results in a short-term increase in inotropy or cardiac ejection volume. In the long term, however, it is associated with an alteration in ventricular geometry and function. It involves several phenomena: neurohormonal activation, altered calcium and mitochondrial metabolism, interstitial fibrosis, hypertrophy and cell death.\n*Figure [[File:Diagram of the main determinants of ventricular remodelling in CI.png|vignette|482x482px|schematisation des principaux d\u00e9terminants du remodelage ventriculaire dans l'IC]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n====Desynchronisation and arrhythmia====\nBackground: IC is accompanied by frequent changes in cardiac electrical activation; it is rare for an IC patient to have a strictly normal ECG.\n\nDesynchronisation: electrical disorders of ventricular activation (first degree AVB, left bundle branch block) with haemodynamic consequences (shorter duration of diastole in the cardiac cycle, delayed contraction of the lateral wall on the septal wall in systole). This desynchronisation can be corrected by specific stimulation techniques such as resynchronisation.\n\nArrhythmias: all the changes encountered in heart failure (alteration of the ventricular substrate, neurohormonal activation, presence of electrical triggers) favour the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardias, fibrillation). These arrhythmias can be poorly tolerated and lead to sudden death. They can be prevented in cases of severe IC by installing a defibrillation system.\n\n===''Right heart failure'''===\nRight heart failure may be secondary to intrinsic damage to the right ventricle or to an increase in right ventricular afterload due to precapillary PH or postcapillary PH itself linked to left heart failure (the most frequent cause).

This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e. it tends to bias the results of the study in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference.\n* or ''differential'', i.e. the risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference, or in favour of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.  \n\n'''Selection bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomisation prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimise these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.  \n\n'''Classification bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the classification error on the judgement criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgement criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words bring the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgement criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgement criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls. Generally speaking, these biases can be limited by using data collection procedures that are as standardised and objective as possible, and that are similar for all subjects included in the study.",

Patients without a precise diagnosis at the latest one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the state of the scientific, medical and technical art does not allow a precise diagnosis to be made. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse.

Understand the obligations of proportionality and competence.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=4}}To study ethical issues, we need tools and rules for analysis and debate.\n\n'''<u>I. The principles approach</u>'''\n\nThe principles approach, proposed by Professors Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress in 1979<ref>Tom L. Beauchamp, James F. Childress (1979). Principles of biomedical ethics. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> in the United States, is interesting, particularly for thinking in the context of healthcare practices, and has met with great success in the medical community. The principles-based analysis approach, known as principalism, proposes the study of the ethical issues involved in a medical practice or a choice of healthcare organisation, from the angle of four major principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice.\n\n'''Beneficence and non-maleficence'''\n\nBeneficence and non-maleficence stem directly from the medical tradition. In its Hippocratic conception, the care-giver-patient relationship is based on Aristotelian morality and \"Primum non nocere\". Historically, medical action whose aim is to do good, by refraining from doing harm, refers to the principle of beneficence; this is a moral principle according to which what is advantageous for a patient must be achieved. This presupposes that medical action is necessarily good by nature, that a medical act is medically validated (today we would say scientifically validated) and that it has been proven in the positive sense of the term. However, as this is not always the case and the benefit/risk balance may be uncertain, the principle of beneficence must be supplemented by the principle of non-maleficence, because the risk of harming a patient may exist. It must be taken into consideration and weighed up.\n\n'''Autonomy'''\n\nThe principle of autonomy derives from the so-called \"modern\" philosophy of the seventeenth century, which prefigured the Enlightenment of the eighteenth. In his Discourse on Method, Ren\u00e9 Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body as a condition of freedom. Freedom, which enables every person to judge what is right or good for them, is based on the act of the mind. The subject's autonomy can therefore be understood as the individual freedom to decide on his or her own preferences through internal deliberation based on a capacity for analysis. It is regulated by a social contract, in the sense given to it by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in which individuals acquire rights within the framework of the common law, in favour of freedom of thought, belief and choice of destiny.\n\nIn the field of healthcare, the application of such an area of patient freedom may have been ignored. For a very long time, medical decisions were taken without the patient's consent, or even without informing him or her. This attitude has been described as 'paternalistic', and since the 1970s there has been a legitimate demand for patients to be involved in the choices that concern them. According to the definition given by the philosopher Tore Nilstun, paternalism consists in treating others in accordance with what you consider to be their good, while rarely subordinating any preferences, expressed or otherwise, to that good. In clinical practice today, the recognition of patient autonomy is reflected in the shared construction of the medical decision. This approach is commonly referred to as the co-decision process. It is based on the recognition of autonomy and is developed through an approach that now requires healthcare providers to inform and take into account the patient's questions, wishes and values. This autonomy must be recognised, but sometimes it cannot be considered an absolute, either because the patient is losing his autonomy and therefore his capacity to analyse and make decisions, or because the demands he may make in the name of his freedom cannot be reconciled with the values or organisation of our healthcare system or our society.\n\n'''Justice'''\n\nThe principle of justice is the result of a collective ideal. It can vary from one society to another. In our society and in the context of healthcare, justice is traditionally understood in terms of non-discrimination, universality, access to healthcare for all and solidarity. It is an open, broad and evolving concept. It undeniably has a strong moral dimension based on respect for the individual. But it is also the source of many ethical tensions, because what may be considered just by some may not be considered legitimate by others. It will undoubtedly be the subject of many debates in the years to come: how far will it be fair to limit access to certain expensive treatments? How far will it be fair to respond to all requests for collective solidarity? This concept therefore directly relates to political choices.\n\nThe nature of justice is above all a democratic choice. So-called redistributive justice (aimed at distributing wealth) involves arbitrating between what is morally desirable and what is materially possible. It can also raise the question of why some citizens should have more or less than others, and according to what criteria (age, merit, fragility, income, value to society, etc.). This would be the transition from the notion of universality to that of proportionate universalism (offering a benefit, but with modalities or intensity that vary according to need). The notion of justice is therefore closely linked to the issue of combating or reinforcing inequalities. It also involves the question of rights and duties: how do we strike a balance between what everyone is entitled to expect, and what we are entitled to expect from each other?\n\nBehind the concept of justice lies the concept of professional responsibility, in the strictest sense of the term: acting in accordance with the rules established by a society, i.e. the common law, with the corollary obligation to be accountable before the law. All professionals must therefore be familiar with the rule of law and incorporate it into their approach in order to assess whether they are complying with it or, if necessary, to justify the reason(s) for not applying it, or even transgressing it. This is a complex process, which requires the company not to act lightly, and to call on the services of high-level experts, in particular through collegial decision-making, and sometimes even through referral to the courts. This approach is particularly applied to end-of-life decisions, refusal of care, forced hospitalisation in geriatric or psychiatric care, or complex decisions to terminate pregnancies.\n\n<II. In practice'''</u>\n\nThe ethics of principles approach must therefore question each of them, in particular beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. First of all, this approach in no way precludes the addition of other principles. Furthermore, the idea is not that these four principles should necessarily be respected in a choice or an action, but that they should be systematically questioned in order to see, on the one hand, why and how they cannot all be respected and, on the other hand, how they compensate for each other.\n\nA decision may be acceptable if one of the principles is compromised but offset by the strength of the other three. The most classic example is the loss of autonomy of the subject, where action is nevertheless possible without the person's consent, because the action will be beneficial, not harmful, and judged to be just. Philosophers such as Emmanuel Levinas and Hans Jonas put forward the principle of beneficence and responsibility for others, which underpins the morality of action in relation to the fragility of others. Hans Jonas advocates a principle of responsibility towards the most fragile and action in the name of beneficence alone. This position avoids abandoning those who are losing their autonomy. But this action must be carried out with respect for mutual understanding, dignified support and the constant search, not for consent, but for the other person's as- sence, in other words the building of a path towards a form of adhesion. So, in the principalism approach, we must not conceive of each principle as an absolute, but as a point to be debated, whose possible transgression or adaptation must be ethically validated.",

Be familiar with the main sources of bias.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Julie Berbis (CUESP),Alexandra Rouquette (CIMES),J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lambert (CIMES)\n|Order=26}}\n\nThere are two sources of error in estimating a parameter:\n\n* <u>Random error</u>, due to sampling fluctuation.  Causes a decrease in the precision of estimates. Depends on sample size, the larger the sample size, the more precise the estimates.\n* <u>Systematic error</u> (bias), not due to chance. The presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. The presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. Independent of sample size\n\n'''Three major families of bias''' :\n\n* <u>Selection bias:</u> linked to the choice of method of selection and/or follow-up (attrition bias linked to lost to follow-up in longitudinal studies) of subjects, leading to the sample analysed ultimately corresponding to a population different from the target population. It therefore threatens the representativeness and external validity of the study.\n* <u>Bias of classification</u>: linked to the measurement of exposure and/or the judgement criterion. The reality of an individual's status (for example, really obese) is not correctly collected in the study (because the scales used to weigh him are faulty and systematically give 3 kilos less). Memory bias is an example of information bias linked to the unreliability of self-reported data.\n* <u>Confusion bias</u>: related to the fact that the observed relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied may be distorted by not taking into account a third factor (confounding factor) itself associated with both the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied.\n\n'''Selection and information biases relate to <u>descriptive and analytical objectives</u>.'''\n\n* They may lead to an over- or under-estimation of measures of frequency and measures of association.\n* They result from errors (avoidable or not) committed by the investigators (diagnostic errors, wrong choice of control group, refusal of participation of eligible subjects, lost to follow-up in a cohort...). <u>They must be identified and controlled at the time of protocol preparation, and cannot be corrected at the time of analysis</u>.\n\n'''Confounding biases relate only to <u>analytic objectives</u>.'''\n\n* They may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the measures of association.\n* They do not arise from errors made by the investigators, but reflect the nature of things. They should be <u>anticipated when planning the study</u> (restriction of inclusion criteria, matching, randomisation if possible, collection of potential confounders, etc.) <u>and can be corrected in the analysis</u> (stratification, adjustment, etc.).",

The law does not specify what is covered by the terms \"particularly serious condition recognised as incurable\" and does not draw up a list, which again is impossible to predict.\n\nAcceptance of the woman's request is conditional on the opinion (validation) of the request by a multidisciplinary collegiate procedure. In practice, this procedure is carried out within a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre (CPDPN).\n\nWhen an abortion is considered on the grounds that continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health, the multidisciplinary team is made up of at least four people:\n\n* a doctor qualified in gynaecology-obstetrics, member of a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre;\n* a practitioner specialising in the condition from which the woman suffers;\n* a doctor chosen by the woman;\n* a qualified person who may be a social worker or psychologist.\n\nThe doctor qualified in obstetrics and gynaecology and the doctor qualified in the treatment of the woman's condition must work in a health establishment.\n\nThe law also specifies that when termination of pregnancy is envisaged on the grounds that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis, the multidisciplinary team responsible for examining the woman's request is that of a CPDPN. When the team from the aforementioned centre meets, a doctor chosen by the woman may, at her request, be involved in the consultation. Unless it is a medical emergency, the woman is offered a period of reflection of at least one week before deciding whether to terminate or continue her pregnancy.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, two doctors who are members of the multidisciplinary team certify that the multidisciplinary opinion has been given and that the request complies with the law. In both cases, prior to the meeting of the competent multidisciplinary team, the woman concerned or the couple is informed and may, at her request, be heard by all or some of the members of the said team.\n\nThree differences between IVG and IMG :\n\n* Termination of pregnancy for medical reasons can only be carried out by a doctor;\n* There is no time limit for termination of pregnancy: it can take place at any time during the pregnancy;\n* The principles for obtaining the woman's request and consent are the same as for abortion, but the CPDPN is responsible for accepting the request for an abortion, following a rigorous procedure.",

The most important stage in the disease is therapeutic education. The first step is to make the diagnosis, because putting a name to the symptoms is the first step in justifying and organising treatment. The fact that clinical and paraclinical tests are normal is often not enough to reassure the patient. The benign nature of the disease needs to be explained, along with the chronicity of the symptoms. Time must be taken to explain the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (alteration of the intestine-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motor disorders and intestinal dysbiosis) and the various treatment options. The aim of this approach is to avoid medical nomadism. The doctor-patient relationship is fundamental. To achieve this, the doctor must listen to the patient's expectations and questions, and avoid inaccurate and vexatious statements such as \"There's nothing wrong with you\" or \"It's all in your head\".\n\n           When a doctor prescribes treatment, it is important to set reasonable targets for the patient. The efficacy of treatments is often uncertain and does not lead to a cure. The aim is to improve symptoms in order to improve quality of life. It is important to plan the assessment of treatment efficacy so as not to miss any warning signs that may warrant a colonoscopy.\n\n           Medicinal treatments (table 1) are based on the prescription of antispasmodics and transit regulators in the first instance. In the second line, treatments such as certain diets, probiotics or hypnosis may also be used. Psychological treatment, or even antidepressants, may also be used. It should be explained that the target is not a mood disorder, but digestive symptoms, particularly abdominal pain.\n\n           As far as dietary management is concerned, simple dietary hygiene advice is offered as a first line of defence (3 meals a day, eat slowly, avoid excessively fatty foods, etc.). When these measures are already respected or are insufficient, patients can be offered a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAPs) over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. This diet eliminates malabsorbed carbohydrates and often results in improved digestive comfort. It is useful for this diet to be supervised by a dietician.\n<br />Table 1: list of main treatments\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Category of treatment\n|International non-proprietary name of treatment\n|-\n|Antispasmodics\n|Alverine + simethicone\n\nTrimebutine\n\nPhloroglucinol\n\nPinaverium\n|-\n|Laxatives\n|Osmotics: Macrogol\n\nBallast: Ispaghul\n|-\n|Transit retardants\n|Loperamide\n|-\n|Antidepressants\n|Amitriptyline\n\nRarely : Serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n|}",

This means that people with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection. The incidence of prosthesis-related IE is estimated at around 5% at 5 years.\n\nEarly AEs (<1 year after implantation) result from peri-operative contamination (catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation, etc.). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).\n\nLate IEs (>1 year after implantation) originate from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are therefore those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).\n\n\nClinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. In addition, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.\n\nThe diagnostic strategy for ARs on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves (see item 152).\n\nAntibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.\n\nThe indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following being particularly favourable: the presence of clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, an uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, the presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by \"Staphylococcus Aureus\".\n\nThe prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends above all on clear information being given to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.\n\nTherapeutic education is essential, particularly with regard to signs that should prompt consultation (prolonged fever, AEG). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.\n\nDental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.\n\nThe antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure.

These have redefined the way in which we see and conceive of illnesses, but also the way in which we apprehend our bodies. As an artefact between carer and patient, between observer and observed, they redefine the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body, and transform the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images and data that can be reductionist.\n\nThe resulting observation is accompanied by its own terminology, which can also lead to distancing and create a gap between what is experienced by the patient (their subjective experience) and the way in which medicine objectifies their body.\n\nWhen it comes to the human body, the human sciences most often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The first is simply a body among bodies, impersonal, governed by natural laws, devoid of specifically human characteristics, an object of action or contemplation.

In the world of healthcare, this distinction makes it possible to relativise and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without falling into the easy reductionism that would consist of directing the carer's attention to a single aspect of physicality.

It is an a posteriori approach to risk. A risk has occurred resulting in harm to a patient. This harm may be real or perceived by the patient.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of errors and the reasons for complaints will enable us to identify ways of preventing further errors by implementing improvement measures.\n\n'''Basics of in-depth analysis of error causes'''\n\n'''Reason's model'''\n\nReason's model (or the Swiss cheese model) is the model most often presented. It has the advantage of drawing attention to the latent causes of an accident, distinguishing between active and latent errors.\n\nThis helps us to understand that human error is most often only a consequence of deeper organisational flaws. This model proposes an analysis of undesirable events in successive sequences in which the different levels of defence existing at each stage have been overcome. This concept of successive barriers has now been replaced by a systemic model, which is too complex to be detailed here.\n\n'''Safety barriers'''\n\nBarriers are in-depth defences (protections) against the risk of error. There are three types of safety barriers:\n\n- prevention barriers ;\n\n- recovery barriers ;\n\n- mitigation barriers.\n\nAn effective safety system must have all three. Neither recovery nor mitigation barriers should be neglected.\n\nThese three types of barriers can be :\n\n- intangible: laws and regulations, instructions, good safety practice, recommendations, procedures and protocols, training programmes, work organisation, etc. ;\n\n- material: physical coding (e.g. special design of medical gas and vacuum connection rings to prevent inappropriate connections of different colours).\n\n'''Prevention barriers'''\n\nThey are designed to prevent errors and accidents from occurring: for example, the surgical checklist, an intangible barrier that breaks down into three stages (Box 5.4), or computerised prescribing in a system that provides alerts based on dangerous doses, the patient's clinical and biological condition, drug interactions, etc.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Inset: Operating theatre checklist adapted from the HAS checklist grid, 2011 version''''\n|-\n|'''''Before anaesthetic induction'''''\n\n'''''Pause time before induction'''''\n\n- Verification of :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. procedure and surgical site (patient, records)\n\n. availability of clinical and paraclinical documentation\n\n. knowledge of the installation method, consistent with the site/intervention, not dangerous for the patient\n\n. skin preparation of the patient being operated on, documented in the department/operating theatre liaison sheet\n\n. equipment/materials required for the operation, with no malfunctions\n\n- Cross-check by the risk team :\n\n. allergic\n\n. inhalation\n\n. intubation difficulties\n\n. ventilation\n\n. bleeding\n\n'''Before surgery'''\n\n'''Pause time before incision'''\n\n- Ultimate\" cross-check within the team, in the presence of the surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s)/IADE, IBODE/IDE :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. planned intervention\n\n. surgical site\n\n. correct installation\n\n. availability of the necessary documents\n\n- Sharing information orally within the team on the elements at risk/critical stages of the intervention (time out) in terms of :\n\n. surgical\n\n. anaesthetic\n\n- In accordance with current protocols:\n\n. administration of antibiotic prophylaxis\n\n. preparation of the operating field\n\n'''After surgery'''\n\n'''Break before leaving the operating theatre'''\n\n- Oral confirmation by staff to the team:\n\n. of the recorded intervention\n\n. the correct final count of compresses, needles, instruments, etc.\n\n. labelling of samples, operating theatres, etc.\n\n. if any undesirable events or medical risks have occurred: report/notification\n\n- Prescriptions for immediate post-operative care are made jointly by the surgical and anaesthetic teams.\n\n\nN.B: IADE: state-qualified nurse anaesthetist; IBODE: state-qualified operating theatre nurse; IDE: state-qualified nurse.\n|}\n'''Recovery barriers''''\n\nThe mistake has been made but recovered before it has any consequences. For example, the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is the antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed before surgery, but the nurse reads about it in the medical record and alerts the prescriber, who changes the prescription.\n\n'''Mitigation barriers'''\n\nThe error has been made and has not been recovered. The aim is to limit the consequences for the patient. For example, a patient suffers cardiac arrest as a result of an error in the route of administration made by a nurse. She notifies the senior doctor as soon as she realises the error. The medical team is on site and starts cardiac massage while the SOS cardiac arrest team called in immediately arrives. The electric shock restored cardiac function, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilisation and monitoring. He was discharged the next day.\n\nRoot cause analysis\n\nThe root causes of a medical error should be sought in the overall context surrounding the undesirable event.\n\nThe analysis methods are structured to avoid oversights. The most commonly used methods are the ALARM method and the Orion\u00ae method. Root cause analysis methods generally include the following six steps for proper application:\n\n1/ Data collection: semi-structured interviews with all the people present at the time of the event, files, any other documents needed to understand the events;\n\n2/ reconstructing the chronology of the event;\n\n3/ Identifying deviations from recommended practices, without judging against an existing benchmark;\n\n4/ identification of contributing factors: immediate and deep or root causes (boxes 5.5)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Box: Typology of contributing factors or root causes (according to the ALARM method)''''\n|-\n|'''''Factors may be linked:'''''\n\n- the patient: state of health, seriousness of associated illnesses, communication difficulties (language, conflict with carers, etc.), vulnerability of certain patient populations (the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, children, adolescents, people with disabilities, the underprivileged, etc.);\n\n- the tasks to be carried out ;\n\n- to the team: communication within the team and with the patient in the therapeutic relationship, traceability of information in the patient file, supervision of junior staff undergoing training;\n\n- the working environment: physical (premises, equipment, supplies, etc.) or organisational (availability of qualified human resources, work organisation, working hours, etc.);\n\n- organisation and management: policies for replacing absent staff (no replacement, temporary staff, travel), continuous training, equipment management, etc;\n\n- the institutional context: national and regional public health policies, adverse event reporting systems, etc.\n|}\n5/ Proposed actions to be implemented (accompanied by an action plan) ;\n\n6/ drafting the analysis report.",

The discovery of these mechanisms led to the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation and spinal cord electrical stimulation to treat certain types of pain.\n\n- Supra-segmental modulation mechanisms (''Figure 2) originate in brain structures, particularly in the brainstem (periaqueductal grey matter, raphe nuclei, etc.) and involve different neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.\n\n- They are also called ''descending controls'' because they are able to modulate, either by inhibiting or facilitating it, the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord in a very powerful way.\n\n- Bringing these modulation systems into play makes it possible to account for classic clinical observations such as the ''absence of a direct relationship between the size of a lesion and the resulting pain'' and, more generally, the influence of psychological, cognitive, contextual and cultural factors on the experience of pain.\n\n- Alterations or dysfunctions in these systems are involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic pain syndromes.<gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Untitled.png 2.png|Figure 1: supra-segmental modulation (inhibitory controls from the brainstem).\n</gallery>\n\n\n'''<u>Pathophysiological elements</u>''''\n\n- Classically, we distinguish \"3 main types of pain\" on a physiopathological basis, even if certain mechanisms (particularly central) are common to these different types of pain. These main types of pain may be associated (e.g. postoperative pain which is typically nociceptive but frequently associated with a neuropathic component).\n\n\n''Pain caused by excessive nociceptive stimulation'' (or nociceptive pain).\n\n- These pains, secondary to various tissue lesions (trauma, burns, infection, malignant processes, etc.), are the most frequent in clinical practice.\n\n- In this case, the nociceptive systems are intact and it is considered that they are linked to the over-stimulation of these systems, notably due to the inflammatory reactions frequently observed in this context.\n\n- Visceral pain\" related to distension of cavities or spasm of smooth muscles (e.g. gastroenteritis, colitis, renal colic, hepatic colic, etc.) is related to pain caused by excess nociception (stretching of the walls, often associated parietal inflammation, etc.).\n\n- Inflammatory processes lead to hyperactivation of the nociceptors (''peripheral sensitisation'') linked to the action of a large number of pro-nociceptive substances (bradykinin, H+ ions, prostaglandins, histamine, substance P, NGF, etc) released during inflammation and liable to directly activate or sensitise the nociceptors.\n\n- Under conditions of inflammation, nociceptors that are normally silent when not stimulated become spontaneously active and their evoked responses are increased and appear with a lower threshold.\n\n- These peripheral mechanisms can secondarily induce central modifications consisting mainly of phenomena of \"central sensitisation\" and \"alterations in modulation systems\", which play a decisive role in the perpetuation of certain types of pain and explain certain therapeutic failures aimed solely at acting on peripheral factors.\n\n- The mechanisms of central sensitisation are complex. In particular, they involve NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptors, the activation of which is linked to the significant increase in the central release of glutamate due to the prolonged activation and sensitisation of nociceptors.\n\n- The cascade of intracellular events triggered by the activation of these NMDA receptors is at the origin of a long-lasting hyperexcitability of central nociceptive neurons (''central sensitisation'') which contributes to increasing and amplifying the pain and could account for the transformation of certain acute pains into chronic pains.\n\n\n'''Neuropathic pain.'''\n\n- They are linked to lesions or diseases of the somato-sensory system and in particular the nociceptive system. They are most often associated with a sensory deficit (deafferentation) and cannot therefore be explained by simple overstimulation of the nociceptors.\n\n- They depend on secondary peripheral and central mechanisms that help to amplify and perpetuate the pain.\n\n- One of the most well-documented peripheral mechanisms is the appearance of '''''ectopic discharges''''', i.e. electrical activity (action potentials) which originate aberrantly at the nerve lesion. These foci of abnormal discharges result from the accumulation at the lesion site of dysfunctional ion channels, in particular certain subtypes of specific sodium channels, whose physiological role is to regulate membrane excitability.\n\n- The profound metabolic changes associated with nerve damage are responsible for a reduction or increase in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides (glutamate, substance P, BDNF, etc.) which are responsible for secondary central changes.\n\n- The central mechanisms are mainly: the development of ''central sensitisation'' phenomena, alterations in modulation systems or neuroplasticity (reorganisation of somato-sensory systems) which contribute to amplifying and perpetuating pain.\n\n\n'''Nociplastic''' (or dysfunctional) pain\n\n- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome, which are characterised by the absence of an identifiable lesion likely to explain the pain.\n\n- The pathophysiology of these pains is less well known, but the best documented hypothesis at present is that they depend mainly on ''alterations in pain control and modulation systems'', with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.\n\n<br />",

At the same time, the concept was incorporated into the Criminal Code, providing special protection for certain victims on the basis of physical and psychological criteria (such as age, illness or infirmity), as well as economic and social criteria (such as dependence due to extreme hardship) specific to the victim. Today, it is all the more widely used, including in politics and the media, and as a result helps to shape our relationship with others and the world.\n\nLike the concepts of risk and precariousness, with which it is often associated, the notion of vulnerability has become an essential part of the humanities and social sciences for understanding people in their social and psychological experience, and the world in which they live, which is considered to be increasingly vulnerable. In today's increasingly high-tech societies, where disasters are already part of our reality, our vulnerability is intensified by the ambivalence between our heightened awareness of risks and the impossibility of controlling them all, whereas since the 19th century, thanks in particular to the development of medicine and social protection systems, we thought we were in a position to deal with the 'problem' of our vulnerability [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\n\n'''Two definitions of vulnerability, to be considered together:'''\n\nIn the human and social sciences, there are two main definitions of vulnerability:\n\n- Vulnerability as a constituent of human existence, universally shared, sometimes qualified as fundamental or ontological vulnerability, and which refers to our anthropological and biological fragility. A human existence affected by illness, loss and distress.\n\n- Vulnerability is dependent on particular historical and social contexts, and is often referred to as social vulnerability. It is the subject of a great deal of work in sociology, which identifies multiple vulnerabilities that affect different realities or populations in given socio-historical configurations. It concerns groups or individuals who are considered to be vulnerable because they have few economic resources, a very precarious employment status, a lack of social support or networks, or obstacles to social integration (isolated elderly people, people who are unemployed, people with precarious employment contracts, people with physical or mental disabilities, people without qualifications, people who do not have access to certain rights, etc.). However, care must be taken not to reduce these groups and individuals to their vulnerability, at the risk of turning them into a stigmatising category. All the more so as this vulnerability, like the notion of precariousness, can have a negative social connotation and be perceived as the responsibility of the individuals themselves, who would also be a burden on others through the assistance measures put in place by society and from which they may benefit. Sociologist Serge Paugam, using the concept of social disqualification, looks at the experiences and views of people living in precarious and poor conditions, whose social status is devalued and who feel a humiliation that often forces them to isolate themselves [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote3sym|<sup>3</sup>]].\n\nSocial vulnerability is also considered in a more dynamic way, as the effect of a recent historical process of undermining the wage-earning system and the move towards more globalised capitalism. The society of the twentieth century, characterised by a solid wage-earning condition (guaranteeing social rights, lasting protection against the hazards of life, social independence and integration, and membership of work collectives), is crumbling to the benefit of decollectivisation and re-individualisation, as well as a neo-liberal discourse that appeals to the imperatives of responsibility, initiative and autonomy. Individuals who do not have, or who have only limited social and economic resources, experience downgrading, dependence on social assistance, low self-esteem and permanent insecurity: \"individuals by default\" who lack the real possibility of being individuals [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote4sym|<sup>4</sup>]]. Robert Castel introduces the term disaffiliation, which has a dynamic logic, to understand the trajectory, in successive stages, of vulnerable groups and individuals (job insecurity; unemployment; then long-term unemployment, with a gradual disintegration of social relations). This new society, which is shaking up the whole social structure, is producing a vulnerability experienced by more and more people (inability to plan ahead and control the future, which requires stability in the present, uncertainty and constant fear of loss, feelings of powerlessness, lack of recognition: all factors which help to explain why these people pay less attention to their health, have less recourse to preventive examinations and find it more difficult to consult socially integrated and recognised health professionals).\n\nWhile fundamental vulnerability and social vulnerability are often dissociated, many authors, including Robert Castel, invite us to think of them together, considering vulnerability as both a universal condition and a potential that can affect everyone, individually, in a different or unequal way due to its relational and contextual dimensions, dimensions on which it is possible to act to reduce it, also making reversibility one of its characteristics. For Castel, we must seek to \"establish a system of strict correspondences between what a social subject experiences in the depths of his personal experience and the conditions imposed on him by his historical period and his social position. Not in order to reduce individual subjectivity to objective determinations, but on the contrary to show that the burdens of history and social constraints are internalised by the subjects that we are, to the point of constituting the fabric of our most personal affects\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote5sym|<sup>5</sup>]].\n\n'''The ethics of care''''' :\n\nVulnerability is at the heart of care ethics, which have highlighted the epistemological, ethical and political issues involved in the mobilisation and use of this concept. Care\" thinking emerged in the United States in the 1970s, with the seminal work of Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote6sym|<sup>6</sup>]]. It became established in France in the 2000s, where the choice was made to retain the Anglo-Saxon term, which refers to a network of meanings not found in a single French term. For Vanessa Nurock, translating the notion of care as \"soin\" or \"sollicitude\" is insufficient, and even erroneous, because it misses what makes care original, namely a novel combination of things that are found elsewhere separately: \"Care refers simultaneously to a feeling (solicitude), to sensitivity, to an activity (lavishing attention or care), to a position (taking to heart), to a relationship with the other (active altruism) and with oneself (without abnegation). This is why the main translations used to characterise \"care\" as \"ethics of solicitude\" or \"ethics of care\" are not sufficient, particularly because they place \"care\" either on the side of an ethical attitude (solicitude) or on the side of a concrete activity (care). But 'care' is precisely both an attitude and an activity\". Vanessa Nurock adds that \"one of the ways to account for the thought of 'care' is perhaps to make explicit what it is not, what it reacts to, to see 'care' as the negation of its negation: the opposite of 'I don't care', i.e. 'I don't care', or 'I don't concern myself with it', or it doesn't concern me\". The ethic of care is defined as a reaction to invisibilisation and indifference [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote7sym|<sup>7</sup>]].\n\nSo care is not just an ethical attitude in the intimate relationship between two people, it also has a public and political dimension: the ethics of care make demands, because it calls into question a hierarchy based on male domination that has long devalued care, reducing it to the care and concern for children and elderly parents provided exclusively by women and referring to charity and sacrifice.  \n\nSeveral notions are fundamental to care thinking. People must be understood in their singularity (the healthcare professional must hear and consider multiple points of view, specific to each person, and sometimes quite different from his or her own) and in their relationships. The care ethic emphasises what links people together, their dependencies and their interdependencies: \"the care ethic is an approach that assumes our interconnectedness with others, relationships of dependency, without promoting sacrifice and self-denial\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote8sym|<sup>8</sup>]]. These relationships of care and dependence must be extended to institutions, by looking at how we care for others through the institutions that link us (medicine being practised within institutions) and how we care for these institutions [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote9sym|<sup>9</sup>]].\n\nThe ethics of \"care\" remind us that dependence and vulnerability concern everyone and are experienced in varying circumstances and to varying degrees, since the human condition is by nature based on links of interdependence. They criticise the way our world is structured around the myth of autonomy, or at least a certain conception of autonomy, that of the rational subject who is master of his own destiny and life, the entrepreneur of his own existence and free, because he is capable of deciding for himself by using his reason and expressing his will.\n\nHowever, they do not consider vulnerability to be a defect or a lack of autonomy, even though it is commonly associated, in current representations, with dependence or loss of autonomy, i.e. a state or situation against which it is necessary to protect oneself or take action in order not to lose or regain the status of an autonomous subject, and if the subject is unable to take action because he or she is too vulnerable, it is necessary to do so in his or her place. If vulnerability is misunderstood, it can be used to justify paternalistic public policies and care and intervention measures for groups designated as vulnerable, at the risk of stigmatising them. In the name of benevolence, we multiply the categories of vulnerable people (children, patients, the elderly, disadvantaged groups, etc.) to make them the targets of policies that often mask the relationships of domination and relegation of those who embody the vulnerability we are trying to distance, master and control. It is the same human being who is both autonomous and vulnerable, according to Paul Ric\u0153ur [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote10sym|<sup>10</sup>]]. So vulnerability is not a negative condition in that it prevents or hinders autonomy, but the normal condition of living beings, the common ground of our humanity rethought in terms of weakness and dependence. In this way, a new paradigm is developing that challenges an anthropology that draws on the register of risk, control and power, and for which vulnerability is a problem, a failure or the mark of powerlessness. It is based on an anthropology that sees human beings as both capable and vulnerable, autonomous and vulnerable.\n\n'''Vulnerability in medicine:''''\n\nIn medicine and in the field of medical ethics, the notion of vulnerability is immediately associated with illness. This is because it alters the general state of the person who has to cope with the intrusion of medical examinations, overcome the upheaval associated with the announcement of the diagnosis, accept the treatments and their consequences, assume the injunction to autonomy, i.e. to be a 'good patient' who is informed, consents and co-decides on his or her care, while enduring the physical pain and moral suffering associated with the disease.\n\nThus, medical practice, at least until recently and to some extent still today, is part of a tradition of caring for individuals made vulnerable by illness, within the framework of a doctor-patient relationship conceived as profoundly asymmetrical, hence the development of and criticism levelled at so-called \"paternalistic\" medicine, which treats patients as if they were children or people incapable of exercising their rights normally and needing to be protected and helped by professionals with the necessary skills and the ability to make the right decisions.\n\nAlthough medical paternalism is largely a thing of the past, the fact remains that doctors are regularly confronted with situations where their patients do not seem to be able to exercise their rights and assert their autonomy. In fact, certain pathological conditions seem to deprive patients of any ability to reason or express their wishes: intense pain, withdrawal caused by certain addictions, extremely diminished and very weak patients, patients in chronic neurovegetative coma, certain dementias or pauci-relational states, certain end-of-life situations or serious chronic illnesses, etc. In these situations, the decision as to what should be done should be delegated to the medical team and/or relatives, in the patient's interest, and if recovery is a possible goal, until the patient can regain a decision-making role. The delegation of decision-making is therefore provisional, the aim being to put an end to the condition that has led to decisions being taken in the patient's place, where possible. Obviously, certain more complex situations do not allow the patient's decision-making role to be restored, but require the patient's support to be considered in the light of his or her wishes - when these are known through advance directives or the testimony of relatives - without it being possible to update them.\n\nHowever, vulnerability is not simply the mark of an inability to be autonomous that concerns only others. One of the contributions of the ethics of 'care' is to have reversed the meaning of the term, making it into a more positive vision of a relational capacity or disposition, in this case essential in the care relationship. What is often overlooked, or even 'unthought of' according to Agatha Zielinski, is the vulnerability of the carer and the fact that the caring relationship is first and foremost an encounter between two vulnerabilities, Common representations and expressions such as 'taking charge' of the patient suggest that there is only one vulnerable being in this relationship - the patient, whose existence is reduced to the condition of being sick, exposed to illness, pain and suffering, even death, but also to the intrusion of care and the action of carers. But the carer is also vulnerable in that he or she is exposed to and affected by the patient's suffering, placing the care relationship within a reciprocal and intersubjective framework that underpins its ethical dimension and leads the carer, assigned responsibility, to act to relieve suffering: this is the object of solicitude.\n\nBut the carer's concern is not just about meeting the needs of the suffering and incapacitated patient, it is also about considering the patient as a capable subject, \"always capable - and in this sense, always worthy of esteem\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote11sym|<sup>11</sup>]], and calling on their resources, desires and willpower so that they remain an active subject in the face of illness and not just a victim of it.\n\n\n[[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text is a revised version of Grandazzi G., \"Du risque au fondement du soin : r\u00e9flexions sur la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''Regards humanistes sur le droit, M\u00e9langes en l'honneur de la Professeure Annick Batteur'', Paris, LGDJ, Lextenso \u00e9ditions , 2021, pp. 143-153.\n\n[[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2anc|2]] Brodiez-Dolino A, \"Le concept de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''La Vie des id\u00e9es'', online 11 February 2016.

In France, half of premature births are due to spontaneous prematurity (spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membranes) and the other half to induced prematurity.\n\nSpontaneous prematurity occurs after spontaneous labour with intact membranes ('''[[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman]], [[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]''') or after premature rupture of the membranes ('''[[Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109|Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman]'''). Induced prematurity is linked to a foetal or maternal pathology leading voluntarily to birth through medical intervention.\n\nThe main causes of induced prematurity are pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]] and [[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''), IUGR, [[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|'''Hypertension during pregnancy'''',Retroplacental haematoma]] and maternal pathologies requiring the birth of the child (respiratory insufficiency [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|''Acute respiratory distress''',]] decompensated heart disease, etc.).).\n\nPatients with preterm rupture of membranes may also have an induced delivery if the condition of the newborn or the mother requires induction of labour or a caesarean section.

What are products and elements of the human body?\nThe \"elements\" of the human body are the organs, tissues and cells of the body. The \"products\" of the human body are renewable: blood and gametes, for example. Fingernails, hair, teeth and hair are called \"phanera\" and are excluded from the scope of the elements and products of the human body discussed here, which refer to three kinds of \"things\":\n\n# Blood and its components, as well as labile blood products.\n# Organs, which can only be \"used\" as part of a donation.\n# Finally, the broader category of tissues or cells, including haematopoietic cells derived from bone marrow, cord blood or placental blood, embryonic or foetal tissues or cells, cord and placental cells, gametes, etc.\n\n== II. What are the principles governing these products and elements of the human body? ==\nAll these products and elements are not vulgar things that can be exploited. But neither are they \"sacralised\". While the human body is in principle fundamentally unavailable (it cannot be alienated), its products and elements sometimes have to be taken to be used, for therapeutic purposes in particular. In a way, therefore, they are available. This availability is governed by three main principles:\n\n* Non-economic ownership: \"The human body, its elements and products cannot be the subject of an economic right\" (Civil Code, art. 16-1). This means that they can never be traded or associated with any price.\n\n* The person's informed consent. The removal of elements from the human body and the collection of its products is subject to the principle of the donor's prior consent, in accordance with the procedures laid down by law (article 1211-2 of the Public Health Code), with nuances and exceptions depending on the situation and the intended purpose. Once the collection or removal has been carried out, the products and elements may be used for purposes other than those initially intended, provided that the person concerned, duly informed, does not object.\n\n* Anonymity: According to article 16-8 of the French Civil Code, \"no information may be divulged that would make it possible to identify both the person who has donated an element or product of his or her body and the person who has received it. The donor may not know the identity of the recipient, nor may the recipient know the identity of the donor. In the event of therapeutic necessity, only the donor's and the recipient's doctors may have access to information enabling them to be identified.\n\nThese principles obviously do not apply in the same way in all cases. For example, \"a transfusion of renewable blood cells with a limited lifespan does not raise the same ethical and reflexive issues and elements as the transplantation of an organ essential to the survival of a recipient, or the aiding of the conception of an individual through the donation of gametes\" (Thibert, 2020).\n\n== III. Ethical issues beyond the legal framework ==\n\n* Elements and products of the human body may be incorporated into biological collections, sometimes known as \"biobanks\", which ensure their conservation and exploitation for scientific purposes or therapeutic innovation. This raises numerous questions about the ownership of samples, the right of withdrawal that donors may or may not exercise, the protection of health data, and the prospect of widespread commercialisation of these elements, for example (Clarizio ''et al''. 2022).\n* For gamete donation for medically assisted procreation (MAP), donor and recipient couples cannot come into contact and know each other's identities. Thus anonymity is initially preserved: the donors and the recipient couple or the single woman recipient can never know each other's identities. However, the 2021 Bioethics Act provides for access to origins for people born from donated gametes or embryos, when they reach the age of majority and if they so request, \"via a national commission\". They will be able to receive information about the donors and/or their identity.\n* In the case of organ removal from the living, consent is obtained after information has been provided on the risks and possible consequences of removal. In the case of \"post-mortem\" removal, consent is reversed (also known as \"presumed consent\"), and presupposes the absence of refusal of such removal, by registration on an automated national register set up for this purpose (see \"Organ donation\" and \"Organ donation and removal from deceased persons\" sheets). This raises ethical issues. Considering \"presumed\" consent as \"genuine\" consent is by no means self-evident, since to consent is to \"agree with\", which implies that you have consciously acquiesced to what you have been offered or asked. To deduce consent to organ donation (the idea of donation also implies an active and personal gesture) from an absence of opposition to the removal poses a problem that the legal framework alone is not sufficient to resolve. Carers cannot therefore take a decision unilaterally on the basis of the law alone. It is essential to open a dialogue with the deceased person's next of kin, all the more so when the deceased person had not explicitly indicated his or her wish to have his or her organs removed \"post mortem\" (possession of a donor card, explicit statements on the subject, etc.).\n\n==== Bibliographical references ====\nClarizio, Emanuele ; Ch\u00e9rici, C\u00e9line ; Dupont, Jean-Claude ; Guchet, Xavier, Herpe, Yves-\u00c9douard.

Since 1<sup>er</sup> January 2018, social protection for the self-employed (RSI) has been entrusted to the general Social Security scheme.\n\n- '''le r\u00e9gime agricole''', within the Mutualit\u00e9 sociale agricole (MSA), covers '''5% of the French population''' and concerns farmers and agricultural employees[1]; made up of a ''one-stop shop'' that manages both health insurance, occupational accidents and diseases, retirement and family benefits. The MSA itself manages the collection of its contributions.\nFile:19 MSA.png\n</gallery>\n\n* The special schemes predate the general scheme and refused to join it in 1945. Although they predate the creation of the Social Security system, they were maintained by the legislator in the decree of 8 June 1946, which is set out in articles L711-1 and R711-1 of the Social Security Code. The latter states: \"The following remain subject to a special social security organisation, if their members already benefit from a special scheme under one or more of the social security legislations:\n* administrations, services, offices, public establishments of the State, industrial establishments of the State and the Imprimerie Nationale, for civil servants, magistrates and workers of the State;\n* regions, d\u00e9partements and communes;\n\n* departmental and communal public establishments that are not of an industrial or commercial nature;\n* activities which entail membership of the French Seamen's Insurance Scheme established by the Decree-Law of 17 June 1938 as amended;\n* mining companies and companies treated as such, as defined by decree no 46-2769 of 27 November 1946, with the exception of activities relating to the exploration or exploitation of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons;\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran\u00e7ais;\n* secondary general interest and local interest railways and tramways;\n* the production, transport and distribution of electricity and gas;\n* the Banque de France;\n* the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris and the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise.\n\nThere are three main types of special schemes:\n\n* the civil service scheme (civil servants and military personnel) ;\n* the scheme for public companies and establishments;\n* other schemes, smaller in terms of the number of beneficiaries, which may be structured either on a professional basis (schemes for notary clerks and employees, mines, churches, etc.) or on a company basis (schemes for staff of the Paris Opera, RATP, SNCF).\n\nThe organisation and operation of special schemes are quite different from one another. However, they are characterised by the fact that the various risks (sickness, family, retirement, accidents at work, etc.) are covered in different ways by the companies or institutions themselves, by specific funds or by the bodies of the General Scheme.\n\nSince 1945, however, we have witnessed a dual phenomenon:\n\n* a significant reduction in their number: while there were more than a hundred of them when Social Security was created in 1945, there will be 27 in 2021, concentrated mainly in the management of pensions (which explains the current problems of reforming the pension system);\n* a rapprochement with the R\u00e9gime G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, both in the way they operate and in the payment of benefits, which are increasingly aligned with it (particularly in terms of retirement and health insurance).\n\nSocial and economic changes have led to major transformations in the economic sectors covered by the special schemes: industrial sectors such as mining and tobacco have declined sharply, with fewer workers and therefore fewer resources for these schemes. The deterioration in the ratio between the number of contributors and the number of beneficiaries poses, in the more or less short term, the problem of the sustainability of these schemes.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.securite-sociale.fr/la-secu-cest-quoi/organisation/les-regimes#:~:text=Les%20R%C3%A9gimes%20sp%C3%A9ciaux,7%25%20de%20la%20population%20fran%C3%A7aise</nowiki>.",

Ethics and prenatal diagnosis (PND) ==\nPrenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all \"medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero\". This activity is carried out under the supervision of the Agence de biom\u00e9decine, a public body created by the law of 6 August 2004.\n\nIts main tools are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis or cordocentesis). Faced with the fear that these techniques could be used to satisfy the desire for \"perfect\" children, ethical considerations led the legislator to introduce a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The text of the law as it stood on 6 August 2004 specified the purpose of PND: \"to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child\".\n\nThe application of advances in foetal imaging and human genetics to foetal medicine is highly questionable. Medical genetics initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, with the discovery in 1956 of the existence of a trisomy of chromosome 21 in the cells of patients suffering from the disease then known as \"mongolism\". Gradually, it became possible to harvest foetal cells from pregnant women using the amniocentesis technique. This marked the birth of prenatal diagnosis, first for trisomy 21 and then rapidly for a dozen other chromosomal anomalies. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis then expanded considerably, due in particular to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring of pregnancies, the appearance of biological techniques for analysing serum markers to assess the risk of trisomy 21 and molecular biology techniques.\n\nHowever, as progress in PND is much more rapid than that in therapy, recognising a disease often means realising that there is no treatment available to cure it, leading some couples to request termination of the pregnancy because of a disease that their future child will (perhaps) develop early, but also, in some cases, late after 30, 40 or 50 years.\n\nIt is then up to the CPDPN to interpret the meaning given in practice to \"a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis\" (Public Health Code).\n\nFrance is one of the few countries to authorise IMG \"at any time during pregnancy\" and the legislator, supported by the National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), has never wished to draw up a list of diseases giving access to IMG, in particular to avoid automatic decision-making (which would not take account of individual situations) and the stigmatisation of a group of people. Indeed, when faced with a request for an IMG, a CPDPN cannot exclude considering the context (the history, culture, representations and convictions of each of the parents), which may lead to different decisions from one couple to another, from one CPDPN to another, for the same pathology. The law therefore leaves a great deal to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and the expression \"particular seriousness\" may be interpreted in different ways by different families and teams. This freedom means that the experience, sensitivity and background of each couple can be taken into account in their decision.\n\nToday, the CPDPNs are faced with certain requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases for which prevention and/or treatment may or may not exist. One example is the case of foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene (which increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer) in families marked by numerous early deaths linked to these diseases. In these situations, requests for IMG have been deemed justified by the family history, which then becomes a criterion of \"particular seriousness\". However, some people question the legitimacy of certain requests.\n\nThe question underlying this whole debate is that of the criteria legitimising a medical decision to terminate a pregnancy. In the case of medical reasons relating to the preservation of the mother's life, there is little debate on this issue, as medicine gives priority to the person \"present\", in this case the mother. On the other hand, in the case of foetal impairment, the underlying issue is a serious one, and ties in with that of the acceptance of disability in our society. Some people, including medical practitioners, although not opposed to abortion, fear that society could slide into a situation where, because there are not enough facilities for the care of disabled children, parents would be encouraged, in an unspoken way, to resort more systematically to abortion. Another question, which is too often avoided by both medical and parental authorities, is: what quality of life can be guaranteed to people whose level of awareness and capacity for autonomy are sometimes difficult to assess?\n\nThe very terms of the law must therefore be questioned in the ethical process of deciding whether or not to terminate a pregnancy:\n\n   - High probability\": you don't have to be 100% sure that a child carrying the mutation will develop a serious disease. Some couples say they don't want to take the slightest risk. But isn't having a child already taking a risk? Others consider that a 25% risk, for example, is acceptable because it means that there is a 75% chance that their baby will be fine. So how we assess the notion of probability depends on each person and their history;\n\n   - incurability\": there may be diseases that are curable but \"disabling\", but behind this handicap, some people put variable notions ranging from \"acceptable\" to \"unbearable\". This involves an assessment of comfort and quality of life. Here again, incurability is a fairly subjective concept whose interpretation can vary from one individual to another;\n\n   - Particular seriousness\": the concept of seriousness also varies greatly from one person to another. What is a serious illness, and for whom? Who decides? Is it serious for the child, for his or her parents, for the doctor, for society? This question arises particularly in the case of diseases that cause intellectual impairment: systematic screening for trisomy 21 is a perfect illustration. When is an illness serious? At birth, in childhood, in adulthood or after the age of 50? How serious is a disease? When it affects a finger, a hand, the whole body, motor functions, cognitive functions? These questions illustrate the density and complexity of the discussions held within the CPDPN. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is necessary, as it is not only their perception of the seriousness of the disease that is at stake, but also their philosophy of life. This dialogue requires a great deal of time and energy on the part of multidisciplinary teams (doctor, geneticist, genetic counsellor, obstetrician, psychologist) whose main role is to support the couple as they work towards a decision.\n\n== B. The specific case of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) ==\nSince 2013, a new screening test for trisomy 21 has gradually come onto the market in France. This is the non-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT), which uses research and analysis of foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood. By simply taking a blood sample from the pregnant woman, this test makes it possible to detect trisomy 21 at a much earlier stage (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea - SA) and with a higher level of performance. The discovery of foetal DNA circulating freely in maternal plasma was described in 1997. Analysis of foetal DNA in maternal blood has already been used for many years in certain antenatal diagnostic indications, such as determining foetal sex in X-linked recessive diseases and genotyping foetal Rhesus D in Rhesus D-negative women. Until 2011, the quality of these techniques meant that they could not be reliably applied to the search for trisomy 21. Today, thanks to advances in new high-throughput sequencing techniques, the screening test for trisomy 21 based on analysis of free foetal DNA in maternal blood has a sensitivity of close to 99.9% and a specificity of 99.8% in high-risk populations.\n\nThis progress is revolutionising the practice of PND insofar as, in addition to trisomy 21, the technique is making it possible to study other characteristics of the foetal genome, with new indications and requests for prescriptions. Current debates are therefore focusing on the conditions of access to this test, not only for trisomy 21, but also for the search for other anomalies (search for risk markers potentially predictive of diseases such as cancers or other pathologies) or access to sex diagnosis.\n\nIt has been proposed that the implementation of the study of foetal DNA in maternal blood should be the subject of applied research, in the field of clinical practice, in order to gain a better understanding of the issues and perceptions of professionals and patients. The preferences of patients and professionals may differ, and the latter may be 'subjected' to the pressure of women's demands.\n\nWill the rules for prescribing these new tests be consensual? Won't the globalisation of access to healthcare and access to e-health via the Internet mean that women will carry out tests on their own, then come back to their doctors with the results and requests for treatment? It will therefore be necessary to assess these attitudes and changes and the nature of the requests, and probably to devise new frameworks and new rules. This will undoubtedly be one of the issues at stake in the forthcoming review of the bioethics laws.\n\nThere is also the question of the impact of this development of the DPNI on requests for terminations of pregnancy. The possibility of carrying out the DPNI test before the end of the first trimester raises a fundamental question: as this test can be carried out at an early stage, even before the first trimester ultrasound, the result can also be given to the patient very quickly, i.e. before the legal term for voluntary termination of pregnancy of 16 SA (weeks of amenorrhoea), potentially allowing direct access to an abortion based, in fact, on this biological result. This development may therefore call into question the spirit of French law, which historically sought to make a clear distinction between two situations: the first, abortion (within a time limit of 16 weeks' gestation) where the woman did not wish to have a child or was unable to welcome one at that point in her life (a situation then described as maternal distress, i.e. with a psycho-social component), and the second, IMG (termination for maternal and/or foetal medical reasons), with no time limit, but currently subject to prior agreement following expertise by a CPDPN reference centre. If the results of the DPNI are communicated to the woman before 16 weeks' gestation and she requests an abortion, the ethical framework of the decision changes completely. Some couples may be tempted to have an abortion, even when the risk of illness has been judged to be low by the doctors or the potential \"anomaly\" to be of little seriousness.\n\nAs far as healthcare professionals are concerned, the future status of the DPNI will undoubtedly need to be clarified so that women are aware of the place it will have in the pregnancy monitoring strategy. To date, some studies show that the number of professionals who do not wish to prescribe this new test at all is low, but that there is a real debate on the legitimate indications and questions associated with its use.\n\n== Key points\n   - PND (prenatal diagnosis) is the set of medical practices designed to detect a serious condition (genetic anomaly, chromosomal abnormality or malformation) in the embryo or foetus in utero, in order to give the future parents the choice of whether or not to terminate the pregnancy and to allow better medical management of the pathology if the pregnancy is continued.\n\n   - When a foetal anomaly is detected, it is up to the CPDPN (multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre) to certify that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition that is incurable at the time of diagnosis. If the pregnant woman so decides, this certificate enables her to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds.\n\nThe technique of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) would allow selection of foetal sex or access to genetic screening for markers of pathology or risk at an early stage in pregnancy. It is easy to understand why, while supporting the emergence of NIPT, it may be necessary to target the indications carefully and possibly discuss the timing of the return of results before or after the time limit for voluntary termination of pregnancy.",

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation centre (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, \"15\", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.\n\n\n'''Emergency call management:''' The call is initially taken by a '''medical regulation assistant''' (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a \"medical regulator (MR)\" who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the \"need for care and commit the necessary resources\": this is \"act I\" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognised by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an \"advisory role\", advising a witness or the patient him/herself on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources: this assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest, for example. The rest of the intervention (\"act II\" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs in order to organise the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.\n\n'''Link to item 17''' Telemedicine, telehealth and telehealth services.\n\n\n'''Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de R\u00e9animation (SMUR)''': The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to '''take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital'', of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu. SMURs may specialise in transporting children (SMUR P\u00e9diatriques).\n\n\nStructures des urgences (SU)'' : A hospital service, the SU is responsible for ''dealing with unscheduled admissions'' to a public or private health establishment, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, of any unselected person presenting in an emergency situation, including psychiatric emergencies''. Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalised around the ''reception organising nurse'' (IOA). The ED is generally organised into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a paediatric care unit. There is usually also a \"short\" rapid care pathway and a \"long\" pathway (patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalisation).",

Typically, tension headaches improve when the subject is relaxed, busy or on the move.\n\n- Clinical examination: sometimes tensing and sensitivity to pressure of the facial or cervical muscles.\n\n- '''Frequency of seizures''':\n\no ''Episodic tension headache'' (< 15 days/month)\n\no ''Chronic tension headache'' which is part of CCQ; headache at least 15 days/month for > 3 months, without or with drug abuse.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''ICHD3 Diagnostic Criteria for Episodic Tension Headache'''\n|-\n|'''A'''\n|'''At least ten episodes meeting criteria B to D''''\n|-\n|'''B'''\n|'''Duration between 30 minutes and 7 days'''\n|-\n|'''C'''\n|'''At least two of the following characteristics:'''\n\nbilateral localisation\n\n'''- pressure or squeeze type (non-pulsatile)'''\n\nlow to moderate intensity\n\n'''- no aggravation by physical activity'''\n|-\n|'''D'''\n|'''Absence of accompanying signs:'''\n\n'''- no nausea, no vomiting'''\n\n'''- photophobia or phonophobia (the presence of only one of these two elements is possible)'''\n|-\n|'''E'''\n|'''Not best explained by another ICHD-3 diagnosis'''\n|}",

Do not confuse ''thermal medicine'' with ''hydrotherapy'' (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or ''thalassotherapy'' (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognised nor reimbursed by the Health Insurance) or ''Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine''.\n\n==Waters used in Thermal Medicine ==\nThey are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The \"thermality\" separates \"cold\" waters (8 to 15\u00b0C, mainly for diuresis cures), \"mesothermal\" waters (25 to 34\u00b0C, for prolonged baths) and \"hyperthermal\" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The \"mineralisation\" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as :\n\n#SULPHUR: H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the \"Pyrenean\" type or calcic;\n#SULPHATE: urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium;\n#SODIQUE CHLORIDES: rich in sodium\n#GAS BARBONATES: sodium or calcium;\n#WITH A RARE ELEMENT: arsenic, iron, copper, selenium;\n#LOW MINERAL content: (trace metals).\n\nNB: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (\"griffon\") and to carry out the treatment on site.\n\nOther thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S) and mud (peloids).\n\n=='''Thermal techniques with 3 main types of cures <small>([[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explain a treatment to the patient]])</small>'''==\n\n#Internal hydrotherapy based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 litres per day) are used for digestive, urinary or metabolic disorders.\n#Contact\" cures: application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.\n#''External hydrotherapy'' uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional or general, of varying temperature, pressure and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.\n\nThe other thermal techniques are ''functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine'' (physiotherapy, postural drainage and respiratory re-education) and also health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place. '''([[Prescription of a rehabilitation SDD-247|Prescription of a rehabilitation]])''''\n\n== '''Spa resorts in France'''==\n'''Around a hundred spa resorts in France:''' firstly in Occitanie (200,000 spa visitors/year), then in Nouvelle Aquitaine (150,000 spa visitors/year) and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (130,000 spa visitors/year). The 3 main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL) and Gr\u00e9oux (RH, VR).\n\n==Indications for spa treatment ==\nChronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialisation in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters). There are 12 therapeutic orientations for spas recognised by the French social security system, and spas may have 2 (exceptionally 3) therapeutic orientations.\n\n#RH : Rheumatology and sequelae of osteo-articular trauma ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]])''''\n#Respiratory tract diseases (ENT or pneumology)\n#MCA : Cardio-Arterial Diseases\n#AU : Diseases of the Urinary System and Metabolic Diseases\n#AD: Diseases of the Digestive System and Metabolic Diseases\n#PHL: Phlebology\n#GYN: Gynaecology\n#DER: Dermatology\n#AMB: Oral and lingual mucosal diseases\n#NEU : Neurology\n#PSY: Psychosomatic disorders\n#''TDE : Troubles du D\u00e9veloppement de l'Enfant'' [[Anomalie du d\u00e9veloppement psychomoteur SD-115|'''(Anomaly of psychomotor development)''']]\n\nNB: obsolete information is shown in italics.\n\nSince the early 2000s, under the aegis of the AFRETH (Association Fran\u00e7aise de REcherche THermale - French Association for Thermal Research), several high-quality clinical trials have been carried out, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of thermal medicine in its main indications. The most validated indications are rheumatology (osteoarthritis, chronic lumbago, inflammatory rheumatism outside flare-ups), followed by arteritis and psychiatry (generalised anxiety disorders).\n\n==Undesirable effects of spa treatments ==\nVery rare and often \"non-serious\": asthenia after a few days of treatment (\"spa crisis\"), complications of treatment techniques, etc. \n\n==Contraindications to spa treatments ==\nObvious non-indications such as infections, cancers, relapsing illnesses, recent cardiovascular diseases, immunodepression, etc.\n\n=='''How to prescribe a spa treatment?'''==\n'''([[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|Drafting a prescription/medical letter]])''''\n\nThe cure is prescribed by the attending physician on a special form to be sent to the Caisse d'AM with its 2 sections: prise en charge (completed by the prescribing physician) and d\u00e9claration de ressources (completed by the insured person). The doctor must specify (using the key letter) the main indication (and any secondary indications). A course of treatment lasts 3 weeks. Reimbursed at 65% by SS (100% reimbursed if ALD, occupational disease or work accident). Complementary medical practices (pharyngeal showers, Proetz displacement method in ENT, thermal gas injections for arteriopathy) are reimbursed at 70%.\n\nThe ''medical surveillance package'' includes 3 medical consultations: on arrival, in the middle and at the end of the cure. Only one cure per year is reimbursed by Social Security. You can renew your spa treatment every year.",

In this case, ''the study may be described as interventional (without being experimental, as there is no change in the nature or levels of the exposure factor)''.\n\n<nowiki>*************************************************************************************************************************************************************</nowiki>\n\n\nRole of the ''promoter'': the natural or legal person who takes the initiative to conduct the research, manages it and ensures that it is funded. They are legally responsible for the research. All RIPH must be promoted.\n\nRole of the investigator: the individual who directs and supervises the conduct of research at a site, in accordance with the protocol.\n\n'''Information and consent''' of research participants: Individuals must be informed prior to any inclusion in research. This information must be appropriate, complete, fair and comprehensible. In the case of studies involving human subjects, informed consent must be obtained for category 1 or 2 RIPH, or non-opposition for category 3 RIPH, prior to any inclusion.\n\nRole of the ''Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes'' ('''CPP''', there are around forty in France): made up of health professionals (doctors, pharmacists, methodologists/biostatisticians) and people from civil society, it checks that the research complies with the conditions set by law and issues a decision-making opinion on the <u>scientific validity and ethical aspects</u> of the research. All RIPH must be authorised by a CPP before it can begin.\n\nAuthorisations from other structures or bodies (CNIL, ANSM, etc) are also required before an RIPH can be launched. The nature and complexity of obtaining these authorisations depends directly on the category of RIPH.\n\n\n'''Non-IPHR research''': research that does not belong to any type of IPHR does not fall within the scope of the Jard\u00e9 law. It is not therefore subject to authorisation by a CPP, but when it involves the use of individual personal data, it must be submitted to the CNIL. This is particularly the case for research based on retrospective data already collected during treatment or previous research, research into cosmetics, satisfaction surveys linked to treatment or not, experiments in the human and social sciences in the health field, evaluations of the way in which health professionals practise, teaching practices in the health field, etc.\n\n<br />",

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196\u00b0C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196\u00b0C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196\u00b0C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",

Spermatic cord torsion is rare after the age of 40.\n*It causes irreversible arterial ischaemia of the testicle 6 hours after the onset of pain. It is a surgical emergency.\n*The risk is that the prognosis for testicular function is compromised by ischaemia and testicular necrosis. This risk is statistically correlated with the duration of the ischaemia: the later the detorsion with revascularisation, the greater the risk to the endocrine and exocrine functions of the gonad.\n*Nevertheless, torsion of the spermatic cord is a therapeutic emergency whatever the duration of ischaemia.\n*There is no room for further investigations. If there is any doubt, surgery should be performed. Testicular Doppler ultrasound can be falsely reassuring. It is mainly prescribed to eliminate differential diagnoses or in cases of suspected long-standing torsion (> 24 hours), but should never delay therapeutic management.\n*The external detorsion manoeuvre has a very limited role. Its aim is to relieve the patient and reduce the duration of acute ischaemia, without delaying surgical management. Even if it is successful (regression of pain), it does not dispense with urgent surgical exploration, as one or more turns of coil may still remain on the spermatic cord.\n\n==''Necrotizing fasciitis'' :==\n\n*Necrotizing fasciitis or perineal gas gangrene is an anaerobic infection of the subcutaneous spaces of the perineum. It may affect fragile patients (diabetes, chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression, etc.). There may be a portal of entry (anal margin abscess, urethral catheterisation), but this is inconstant. It progresses in 3 phases: inflammation, gas gangrene and skin necrosis. It is accompanied by a serious septic state.\n*Management of necrotising fasciitis is a vital medical and surgical emergency: excision/drainage, broad antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, resuscitation. The prognosis is poor, with an estimated mortality rate of between 20 and 50%.\n\n==''Paraphimosis:'''==\n\n*Paraphimosis is a surgical emergency involving strangulation of the glans penis, leading to necrosis of the glans penis and sheath.

Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment of the attack. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip or shoulder.\n\n\nThe diagnosis of gout is based on :\n\n- background: men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout);\n\n- certain nutritional deviations that highlight gene-environment interactions: excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even \"sugar-free\" soft drinks), consumption of beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine), strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.), high-calorie diets (excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks in general) and diets rich in animal proteins;\n\n- history (previous gout attacks, family history of gout, history of uric lithiasis); in a gouty attack, triggers should be sought: trauma, postoperative context, infarction or distant infection, medication (initiation of a hypouricemic agent), intake of certain drinks or foods triggering gouty attacks in a given gout sufferer;\n\n- the characteristics of a microcrystalline crisis ;\n\n- topography ;\n\n- their rapid sensitivity to colchicine (started early);\n\n- the presence of visible and/or clinically palpable tophus;\n\n\nReasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test\n\n- uricemia, which is most often found to be above 360 \u03bcmol/l (60 mg/l), but which may be normal during attacks (the measurement should be repeated a fortnight after the gouty attack, to obtain a \"basal\" uricemia before the start of hypouricemic treatment);\n\n- detection of UMS microcrystals in the joint fluid or in a clinical tophus: this is the most important diagnostic test as it is pathognomonic +++.\n\n- requesting an imaging test :\n\n- Joint radiography does not show the appearance of uratic arthropathy until very late, with epiphyseal geodes or notches, prolonged preservation of the joint space and marginal osteophytosis. It is particularly useful for differential diagnosis +++.\n\n- joint ultrasound, with colour Doppler, can be very useful if it shows a \"double contour\" appearance (corresponding to the uratic deposits present on the surface of the cartilage) or to detect gouty tophus not visible on clinical examination or X-ray. Doppler will show the more intense vascularisation associated with the vascular component of the local inflammatory reaction.\n\n\n'''Identify situations requiring specialist advice'''\n\n- Any early onset of gout before the age of 35 (on the advice of rheumatologists or specialist nephrologists: look for genetic or kidney diseases).\n\n- Polyarticular gout.\n\n- Tophaceous gout or gouty dactylitis.\n\n- Gout in chronic renal failure (GFR < 60 ml/min).\n\n- Gout in heart failure or unstable coronary artery disease.\n\n- Gout that is difficult to treat (ineffectiveness, intolerance or contraindications to the use of colchicine, NSAIDs and repeated use of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids).\n\n- History of allopurinol allergy before starting febuxostat.",

The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:\n\n*embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.\n*thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n*coagulation disorders.\n\nAetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, ''as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit''. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.\n\nThe \"treatment\" is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:\n\n*In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.\n*Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox\u00ae, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.\n*long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g. atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).\n\n== Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) ==\nCRVO is characterised by the following:\n[[File:OVCR.jpg|vignette]]\n\n*Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.\n*On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.\n*Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form;\n*Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.\n\nIn patients aged over 50, the ''etiological work-up'' is therefore usually as simple as possible:\n\n*to look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia;\n*as well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.\n\nIn cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).\n\nNon-ischaemic forms\" in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:\n\n*either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases);\n*the persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.\n\nIschaemic forms'', either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.\n\nThe development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to \"neovascular glaucoma\" (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).\n\nThe aim of ''treating'' a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.\n\nNo medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.\n\nTreatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox\u00ae) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.\n\n<br />",

Ochre dermatitis is irreversible and usually begins on the inside and lower side of the leg,\n*Eczema of the lower third of the leg is also a frequent complication of chronic venous stasis. The lesions are erythemato-vesicular or scaly in the pathological venous territory,\n*Milian's white atrophy takes the form of small porcelain-white areas, mainly located on the malleolus. It is surrounded by ochre dermatitis or telangiectasia. It reflects a rarefaction of capillaries within fibrous tissue, and therefore the presence of genuine cutaneous ischaemia, heralding the onset of a venous ulcer,\n*stasis dermo-hypodermatitis (lipodermatosclerosis) is localised to the lower third of the leg, initially taking on an inflammatory appearance with skin redness and pain, then progressing in flare-ups. These lesions are associated with extravasation of polymorphonuclear cells. Progressive evolution leads to a sheathing fibrosis inducing a rigid gaiter (\"sclerotic hypodermitis\"). Ankylosis of the ankle further impairs venous return. The diagnosis of erysipelas is an important differential diagnosis of inflammatory stasis hypodermatitis,\n*Lymphatic stasis is the consequence of advanced CVI, which alters the lymphatic network. It leads to permanent infiltrated oedema and thickened, cardboard-like skin. Lymphatic stasis is often aggravated by recurrent local superinfections,\n*skin ulcer SD-092|venous ulcer.\n\n==''CEAP classification of DVI (\"C\" for clinical)'''==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | CEAP classification of CVI\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''C: for clinical signs (grade 0-6)'''\n\na for asymptomatic, s for symptomatic\n|-\n|0\n|no visible or palpable signs\n|-\n|1\n|Telangiectasias or reticular veins\n|-\n|2\n|Varicose veins\n|-\n|3\n|Edema\n|-\n|4\n|Trophic disorders: ochre dermatitis, eczema, hypodermatitis\n|-\n|5\n|Healed ulcer\n|-\n|6\n|Unhealed ulcer\n|}\n<br />",

The management of errors and complaints; the therapeutic hazard\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Knowing the definition of criminal liability\n|Description=None\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Bastien Boussat\n|Order=2}}\n\nThe purpose of criminal liability is to punish individuals whose behaviour is reprehensible in our society. It is always personal, and applies equally to all doctors (including interns), regardless of the context in which they practise. It may also apply to health establishments in their capacity as legal entities.\n\nBehaviour that society defines as reprehensible is called an offence. These are listed in the French Penal Code and classified into three categories in order of seriousness: contraventions, d\u00e9lits and crimes.\n\n'''Infractions'''\n\nApart from certain specific provisions relating to non-compliance with conditions specific to certain healthcare activities (medically assisted procreation, biomedical research activities, etc.), the offences for which a doctor may be held responsible may also be committed by any citizen. However, doctors are more likely to commit certain offences than others. There are three main types of offence arising from the practice of medical care: those resulting from the breach of a duty of humanity, unintentional injury and manslaughter, and intentional injury and manslaughter.\n\n'''Violation of a duty of humanism'''\n\nThe violation of a duty of humanism mainly concerns 1/ the drafting of false certificates (article 441-7 of the French Penal Code), 2/ the violation of professional secrecy (article 226-13 of the French Penal Code) and 3/ failure to assist a person in danger (article 226-3 of the French Penal Code, box 5.1). It should be noted that failure to inform the patient does not constitute a criminal offence. It is, however, a potential cause of civil liability.\n\n'''Manslaughter and manslaughter'''\n\nManslaughter and unintentional injury cover the majority of offences for which a doctor is liable (articles 221-6, 222-19 and 222-20 of the French Penal Code). A patient's death or injury is presumed to be the result of a fault involving clumsiness, carelessness, inattention, negligence or failure to comply with a safety obligation. The doctor in question may have failed to comply with the best available scientific evidence or may have committed a \"trivial\" error in making a diagnosis, prescribing a treatment or carrying it out. For the offence to exist, the damage and the certain causal link with the fault must be established. The causal link can be either direct or indirect, provided that the fault committed is qualified, i.e. having created or contributed to creating the situation that contributed to the damage, or having failed to take the necessary measures to avoid it. There are two types of qualified fault:\n\n- deliberate fault: this is a breach of a specific duty of care or safety imposed by law or regulation. It requires a deliberate (i.e. conscious) breach of a rule of caution or safety.\n\n- Serious misconduct: this is recklessness, negligence or a breach of a duty of care or safety that exposes the patient to a particularly serious risk, of which the doctor cannot be unaware.\n\n'''Homicide and wilful bodily harm'''\n\nThese are still rare offences in the field of medical liability. They essentially boil down to the question of :\n\n- euthanasia ;\n\n- failure to obtain a patient's consent to a medical act ;\n\n- failure to comply with the conditions governing the lawfulness of certain medical procedures, which are governed by specific laws: termination of pregnancy, sterilisation for contraceptive purposes, removal of organs, human experimentation, etc.\n\n'''Implementation of criminal liability'''\n\n'''Lawsuits'''\n\nProsecutions are initiated by the public prosecutor, who decides what action to take on complaints, reports and police investigations. He or she may dismiss the case, refer the perpetrator directly to trial or request that a judicial investigation be opened.\n\nIf the case is not dismissed, the judicial investigation stage is the rule in medical matters, given the frequent complexity of the cases.\n\n'''Judgment'''\n\nMinor offences are tried by the police court and punishable by fines, misdemeanours by the criminal court and punishable by imprisonment, and felonies by the assize court and punishable by criminal imprisonment.\n\nThe offences of which doctors are accused are usually dealt with by the criminal courts, and are essentially offences punishable by imprisonment, which may be suspended, and fines.\n\nAt the same time as the criminal penalty is imposed, the patient who is the victim of the crime can claim compensation for the damage he has suffered, in the course of the same proceedings, by bringing a civil action.\n\n<br />",

It therefore requires recourse to medically assisted procreation. It enables couples at high risk of transmitting a genetic disease to avoid the ordeal of prenatal diagnosis (Preimplantation Diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>) and possible termination of pregnancy. PGD allows only embryos free of the genetic disease present in the family to be transferred. In France, the practice of PGD is highly regulated. It is only authorised in exceptional cases, when a couple has a high probability of giving birth to a child suffering from a particularly serious genetic disease recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis [[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\nEthical issues. The ethical debate primarily concerns possible developments in this activity. Although the initial indications for PGD were those of prenatal diagnosis, they have since evolved considerably. A wide variety of PGD applications have developed. The most controversial practices are (1) HLA typing of embryos for haematological disorders and (2) determination of embryonic sex for personal convenience ('social sexing').\n\n(1) The possibility of selecting embryos so that they are immunologically compatible with a sick brother or sister requiring a marrow transplant is being sought so that the child, once born, can be a potential cord blood donor. This possibility opened up by PGD brings us back to the concept of the \"medicine baby\" (or \"donor baby\", or \"double hope baby\"), and with it the debate on the possible instrumentalisation of procreation. In France, HLA typing of embryos for hereditary diseases is authorised. However, when there is no risk of hereditary disease, HLA typing is prohibited. The CCNE's position was clear: \"The primary justification for PGD is the birth of a child free from a serious genetic disorder that threatens him or her. The search for immunological compatibility with a sick elder child must always come second\". The absence of any direct benefit for the embryo therefore prohibits recourse to this type of procedure. However, this application is being developed in other countries in cases where a first-born child with cancer could benefit from a compatible cord blood cell transplant. In these countries, the absence of regulations authorises these practices, becoming a source of medical nomadism.\n\n(2) The ethical debate on sex diagnosis for convenience pits supporters of the absolute freedom to have children as one wishes, with whom one wishes, when one wishes, of the sex one wishes, as an inalienable expression of Freedom, against defenders of gender equality as an equally inalienable expression of the principle of Gender Equality. Supporters of social sexing argue that choosing a child's sex is not contrary to the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice ('principalism'). They point out that this practice does not entail any societal risks or eugenics, but does help to balance the sexes in a family. Opponents of sex selection point to the potential harm to the child, the risk of eugenics and gender standardisation.\n\n[Pre-implantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] Prenatal diagnosis (PND) refers to medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus \"in utero\".\n\n[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2anc|2] Chromosomal abnormality, risk of aneuploidy, autosomal recessive diseases (including cystic fibrosis, B-thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy), autosomal dominant diseases (including steinert's disease, Huntington's chorea, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and X-linked diseases (including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, haemophilia, fragile X).

A high level of irritability is almost constant in infants and young children.\n\nOther organ disorders may be associated (systemic vasculitis): cardiac (myocarditis, pericarditis), hepatobiliary (hepatitis, hydrocholecyst), neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis), pulmonary, ocular (uveitis) or digestive.\n\n\n'''Incomplete form'''\n\nThere are incomplete forms (fewer than 4 major criteria), which can lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in younger children, and thus expose them to a greater risk of cardiac complications.\n\nIn the presence of unexplained fever lasting more than 5 days, with a patient in poor general condition, it is therefore important to be able to investigate this diagnosis (in addition to the infectious work-up) by means of a biological work-up and cardiac ultrasound.\n\nA normal cardiac ultrasound scan does not rule out the diagnosis, but in the case of coronary dilatation, the diagnosis may be accepted even if there are fewer than 4 other major criteria other than fever.\n\n\n'''Biological abnormalities'''\n\nThe following anomalies are often observed:\n\n- inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and SV, hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis (appearing later (D10) than the other parameters), hypoalbuminemia\n\n- liver abnormality: moderate cytolysis (frequent), more rarely elevated bilirubin\n\n- very frequent aseptic leucocyturia\n\n- Aseptic meningitis (when LP is performed)\n\n\n'''Complications'''\n\n- acute: multisystemic form \"Kawasaki shock\" with myocarditis, multivisceral damage, macrophagic activation syndrome\n\n\n- sub-acute: ''dilatation of the coronary arteries'' which may lead to aneurysm.

They therefore reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ''survival time''. They are also called \"censored variables\" because of their incomplete nature:\n\n* If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).\n* When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ''censoring'': the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ''lost to view'' before the end of the study (e.g. following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.\n\nMethodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to take account of this censoring of survival time.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not knowing the event before t) and can therefore be represented graphically in the form of a ''survival curve'' as in the figure below.\n[[File:FigureSurvival.jpg|thumbnail|Example of survival curve]]\nA survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase).

The ''median survival'', which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample.

[[Frequency measurement, Prevalence, Incidence (rate of), Risk 2C-020-DE-A07]]), possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population, or in other populations, or between several periods, possibly standardising on the distribution of sex, age (cf. [[Adjusted frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13|Standardised frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13]])\n* <u>Analytical</u>: to study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied by comparing frequency indicators of the health phenomenon between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects by tests and measures of association (cf. [Raw or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), number needed to treat (NNT) and crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]] and [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]. ).\n\nMethods of '''recruitment''' of the subjects making up the sample at the initial time :\n\n* <u>Cohort study with a cross-sectional starting point</u>: initial sample formed from the selection (preferably exhaustive) or random drawing of subjects presenting consecutively at one or more recruitment centres (source population, cf. [[Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05]]). This sampling aims to have the best possible representativeness of the target population.\n<u>Exposed/unexposed cohort studies</u>: a particular form of cohort in which exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.\n\n'''Follow-up''' after inclusion: what characterises a cohort is this follow-up of subjects (= <u>longitudinal study</u>) since their inclusion for a period generally determined for the study in order to collect data after inclusion:\n\n* the possible occurrence of the event studied (absent at inclusion) when the endpoint is qualitative with its date of occurrence, or changes in the level of the endpoint if it is quantitative (for which the baseline level is available at inclusion)\n* the date of early exit from the study due to death (if not part of the endpoint itself), relocation or lack of news (lost to follow-up).\n\nRetrospective, prospective or mixed character:\n\n* <u>Prospective cohort</u>: the start of inclusions is after the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n* <u>Retrospective cohort (= historical)</u>: the start of inclusions is prior to the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n** The initial sample is reconstituted ''a posteriori'' as it might have been constituted in the past by selecting a group of subjects at an initial time in the past. This is only possible when we have a file of identifiable subjects for such a study (for example, a file of company employees with occupational health data) whose status with regard to the health phenomenon studied at inclusion can be determined, even for subjects who can no longer be contacted at the time the study is designed.\n** The follow-up history of these subjects between inclusion and the point date is therefore reconstructed retrospectively. This is therefore only possible if individual follow-up of subjects from inclusion to the point date is available.\n* <u>Mixed cohort</u>: combination of the two previous modes of inclusion (inclusion and follow-up partly retrospective then continuing after protocol finalisation prospective manner).\n\n== Case-control study\nInvolves the separate selection of two groups of subjects:\n\n* a group of subjects suffering from the event under study (''cases'')\n* a group of subjects not affected by the event under study (''controls'')\n\n'''Advantage''': being able to over-represent in the sample people carrying a phenomenon to be studied <u>rare</u> in the population (often a disease). In this case, it can be interesting to include several controls per case because the statistical power increases, but in general this gain is minimal compared with the logistical complexity beyond 5 controls per case.\n\nMeets exclusively '''analytical objectives''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls by calculating the <u>odds-ratio</u>, which is the only measure of association that can generally be estimated in this type of survey (cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]).\n\nRecruitment of cases:\n\n* <u>Case-incident</u> (= the subject is included at the time he or she becomes a case): recruitment of cases on the occasion of diagnosis or the occurrence of the event.\n* <u>Prevalent-case</u> (= when included the subject has already been a case for some time): recruitment of cases regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made (recruitment more often the source of selection bias - selective survival bias, cf. [[Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias 2C-020-DE-A12]] - but generally allows faster recruitment than case-incident recruitment because it is possible to \"draw on\" the active files of patients who have already been diagnosed).\n\nProcedures for '''recruiting controls''' must be thought through very carefully because, ideally, controls should come from the same population as cases: i.e. <u>any controls eligible and identifiable for the study could have been recruited as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon under study.</u> It is often done in parallel with the recruitment of cases, with possibly <u>matching</u> or <u>stratification.</u>\n\n'''Collection of exposures''' always <u>retrospective</u> in a case-control study for these two groups of subjects: the period covered by the collection of information on exposure is therefore always prior to the start of the survey.\n\n== Cross-sectional survey ==\nMainly used to'''' estimate the level of qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances, etc.)''' in a targeted population.\n\nCan meet a number of objectives:\n\n* '''Mainly descriptive''': estimating the level of indicators in a target population with a quantifiable margin of error (confidence interval) due to sampling fluctuations. In particular, this is the only study that makes it possible to estimate <u>prevalences</u> of a binary health phenomenon at the time of the study in a target population (provided that the sample recruited is representative of the population targeted in theory by the objectives)\n* '''Sometimes analytical''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the studied phenomenon collected at the time of the study, by estimating measures of association (relative risk, odds ratio, cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]). But the interpretation of these associations is all the more limited because the <u>chronological relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied</u> is not always easy to establish, and because previously exposed subjects who have developed a rapidly fatal form of the disease will not be included in the study (selective survival bias, see [[More advanced knowledge on biases 2C-020-DE-B14]]).\n\nRecruitment procedures: guided by the need to be as representative as possible of the population targeted by the study. Selection must be independent, i.e. it must not take into account the subjects' health status or the level of exposure, which we may be seeking to study if they constitute risk factors for the phenomenon under study. Random selection or consecutive inclusion of subjects within a source population are the methods of choice for these studies.\n\n'''Information collected''': status of each subject included with regard to the phenomenon studied and possibly exposure factors at the time of inclusion, regardless of the age of the events collected. It is not uncommon to collect in addition the <u>background and history</u> on the phenomenon studied and the exposure factors of the subjects relating to the period prior to inclusion, possibly since their birth. In contrast, <u>no data on events occurring after the subject's inclusion in the study are collected in a cross-sectional survey</u>.",

In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry.\n\nIf there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for LCH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed.

The associated drug treatment consists of preventing the complications of atherosclerosis: prescription of a statin (''[[Prescription and monitoring of a lipid-lowering agent]]''), antiplatelet treatment (''[[Anti-platelet agents|Prescription and monitoring of an antiaggregant treatment]]'') and an ACE inhibitor/ARB2 for the control of [[Hypertension in adults and children|hypertension]].\n\n===''Monitoring of AAA'''===\nThe monitoring schedule for asymptomatic AAA depends on its maximum diameter and the value at which the indication for surgery is discussed:\n\n- Maximum diameter less than 40 mm: surveillance ultrasound every year\n\n- Maximum diameter between 40 and 49 mm: surveillance ultrasound every 6 months\n\nFrom 50 mm, the indication for surgery is discussed.\n\n===''Surgical management'''===\nThe aim of surgical treatment of AAA is to prevent it from rupturing.\n\n- In men, it is discussed from a maximum diameter of 50 mm.\n\n- In women, it may be discussed for a diameter of less than 50 mm, as the risk of rupture is higher in women of the same diameter.\n\n- In men and women, it is indicated in cases of rapid growth (more than 1 cm in one year), or in cases of complicated aneurysms.\n\nThe pre-operative assessment includes an overall cardiovascular evaluation and an assessment of renal and respiratory function.\n\nTwo surgical techniques are currently used: conventional surgery and endovascular surgery.\n[[File:AAA Surgery.jpg|vignette]]\n- Conventional surgical treatment consists of flattening the graft. After laparotomy or lumbotomy, aortic clamping, opening of the AAA shell and removal of the thrombus, a prosthetic tube is sutured to the healthy aorta above and below the aneurysm to reconstruct the aorta.\n[[File:Aorta Endoprosthesis.jpg|vignette]]\n- Endovascular surgical treatment is less invasive. It involves intra-arterial femoral insertion of a suitable stent graft which is deployed in the aneurysm. A seal is achieved proximally, on a segment of healthy aorta above the AAA and below the renal arteries (collar), and distally, in the iliac arteries. Exclusion of the aneurysm by stent grafting requires specific anatomical conditions, which limit the indications. Endovascular treatment is preferred in patients at high risk of surgery. If the anatomy is favourable, it may be offered to low-risk patients.\n\n==='''Follow-up after AAA exclusion'''===\nFollow-up after surgery depends on the type of operation:\n\n*the [[Monitoring of valve and vascular prosthesis wearers|prostheses]] used in conventional surgery may be complicated by anastomotic aneurysms requiring annual monitoring by Doppler ultrasound;\n*the [[Monitoring of wearers of vascular valves and prostheses|endoprostheses]] require long-term monitoring by ultrasound-Doppler or angio-CT to detect the presence of endoleaks, migration or limb folds which may be complicated by occlusion.\n\nThe survival rate of patients, even after surgery, is lower than that of the general population. This excess mortality is explained by advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors, associated atherosclerosis, COPD and other post-smoking pathologies.\n\nMedical monitoring of the patient undergoing surgery must detect the secondary occurrence or evolution of other localisations of aneurysmal disease or atheromatous disease.\n\nThis medical management is based on the control of risk factors and the prevention of cardiovascular risk by medication (statin, antiplatelet, ACE inhibitor / ARB2).",

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n\n'''<u>Know the tools and scales for assessing pain in communicating and non-communicating adults</u>''''\n\n'''General principles '''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.\n\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\n\nIt generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).  \n\n\n<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:EVA adults.png|EVA adult\nFile:EVA child.png|Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n</gallery>\n                                                                             \n\n\n                                                                      \u00a0      \n\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support.

The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether or not the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated: stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium (loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule). PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol (an active metabolite of vitamin D) increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.\n*Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone.\n*Hypocalcaemia therefore results :\n**either an increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation),\n**or a reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption).",

This subretinal fluid (SRF) will lift the retina from close to close: this is DR.\n\nA number of \"factors\" contribute to the occurrence of a DR:\n\n*Age: idiopathic DR, linked to posterior physiological vitreous detachment in the elderly.\n*Myopia, particularly severe myopia (myopia greater than -6 dioptres): the risk of rhegmatogenous DR increases with the degree of myopia;\n*Cataract surgery (aphakic or pseudophakic DR), which is complicated by DR in around 2% of cases, with a variable delay, sometimes several years after the operation on the lens.\n*Trauma\n*Uveitis\n\nThe spontaneous course of the disease is very unfavourable: the DR inexorably spreads, encompassing the macula and then the entire retina. Within a few weeks, the detached retina suffers irreversible damage leading to blindness.\n\nThe ''suggestive clinical signs'' of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are:\n\n- myodesopsias followed by phosphenes corresponding to the onset of the retinal tear\n\n- amputation of the peripheral visual field, corresponding to the formation of the DR\n\n- when the DR lifts the macula, it causes a drop in visual acuity (white, painless eye).\n\nA fundus examination, including examination of the peripheral retina, is used to:\n\n*make the diagnosis: the retina appears raised, mobile, forming voluminous folds\n*search for the causal tear: the surgeon must try to find several tears, as multiple tears are common and failure to identify one or more tears can lead to failure of the surgical treatment.\n\nThe ''treatment'' is solely ''surgical'': its principle is to seal the peripheral retinal tear, stopping the passage of LSR; the residual LSR is then resorbed by the pigment epithelium and choroid, allowing the retina to replicate. The anatomical (around 90% success rate) and functional prognosis of surgical treatment is better the earlier it is performed, especially when the macula is raised by the DR. DR is therefore considered a \"semi-emergency\", warranting surgery within a few days of diagnosis.",

It is not uncommon for the patient to minimise the complaint (anosognosia), while the family and friends are concerned about it''([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]]).''''\n\nOn neuropsychological assessment, the most characteristic memory impairment in AD is \"episodic memory consolidation disorder\". In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.\n\nIn verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterised by :\n\n- no encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words)\n\n- a collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge)\n\n- above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word \"truck\": \"what was the vehicle?\"), with clues often causing \"intrusions\" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.\n\nConsolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the \"five-word test\", a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item \"free recall/indexed recall\".\n\nThis profile of memory impairment :\n\n- as opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).\n\n- results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome)\n\n- is a good clinical argument in favour of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease)\n\n- is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD)\n\n- is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.",

It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   \n\nThe Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It \"aims to control social and health spending\". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.\n\nIt should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.\n\nThe LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.\n\nSince 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.\n\nExamples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.gouvernement.fr/presentation-du-projet-de-loi-de-financement-de-la-securite-sociale-2022</nowiki>",

The dose is 400 to 600 mg, to be repeated if necessary, without exceeding 1,200 mg/24 h. Paracetamol + codeine may be an alternative. Paracetamol alone and phloroglucinol are not recommended. The duration of treatment may vary from a few hours to a few days.\n\nFor the instrumental method, NSAIDs are recommended to limit intraoperative and postoperative pain.

The risk of complete failure in the case of instrumental abortion is exceptional (1 to 5 \u2030). The rate of progressive pregnancy after medical abortion is 1%.\n\nPartial failure is defined as an incomplete abortion. It is more frequent in the case of medical abortion.

They mainly concern mechanical valves, but also biological prostheses, particularly those implanted percutaneously. They are more frequent in the first year.\n\nThree main risk factors have been identified:\n\n- Prosthesis in mitral/tricuspid position versus aortic position (lower pressure regime)\n\n- Presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular dysfunction\n\n- Old generation mechanical prosthesis\n\nA poorly balanced INR remains the main cause of thrombo-embolic complications in the case of mechanical valves.\n\nIn the case of mitral and aortic prostheses, they are manifested by systemic embolisms, potentially cerebral (TIA or stroke), more rarely embolisms responsible for acute limb ischaemia, splenic or renal infarction.\n\nMore rarely, obstructive prosthesis thrombosis may occur. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy, with a picture of PAO or cardiogenic shock. Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).\n\nDiagnosis is essentially paraclinical, with TTE and TEE showing an increase in trans-valvular gradients, a reduction in the functional valve area and sometimes an image of thrombus visible on the prosthesis. In the case of mechanical prostheses, radiocinema of the valve can also reveal blockage or reduced mobility of the leaflets.\n\nINR measurement is essential in any clinical situation where there is a suspicion of prosthesis thrombosis.\n\nThe management of acute prosthesis thrombosis may require emergency surgery, with a high mortality rate (around 30%).\n\nIn sub-acute forms or those with minor dysfunction, or in inoperable patients, correction of anticoagulation or the addition of an anti-aggregant, or even thrombolysis, may be suggested.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis remains infective endocarditis.\n<br />\n\n===='''''Prosthesis disinsertion'''''====\nDisinsertion of a prosthesis is responsible for a para-prosthetic leak, i.e. between the valve annulus and the Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM flange</sup>. The main aetiology to look for and evoke remains, above all, infective endocarditis. Suture loosening without infectious origin is also possible.\n\nThe clinical picture is one of aortic or mitral insufficiency, with severity and rate of onset depending on the speed of onset and grade of the leak.\n\nAuscultation therefore reveals a diastolic aortic murmur or a systolic murmur at the mitral focus.\n\nBiological tests may reveal haemolytic anaemia (increased LDH, reduced haptoglobin and presence of shizocytes), more frequently in the mitral position.\n\nThe key examination is TTE (and TEE), which reveals a Doppler flow of para-prosthetic regurgitation.\n\nDepending on the severity and rapidity of the leak, management may range from simple monitoring to surgical intervention. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, or in subjects at high risk of surgery, percutaneous closure may be discussed.\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 5 - TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak.jpg|vignette|656x656px|Figure 5: TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n===='''''Degeneration of bioprostheses'''''====\nThe main disadvantage of bioprostheses is that they degenerate over time. This degeneration most often expresses itself in a stenosing mode, more rarely in a receding mode (which generally progresses more rapidly) or in a mixed mode.\n\nThe average time before the appearance of ultrasound signs of degeneration is around 8 years.\n\nThe risk factors are male gender, implantation at a young age, renal insufficiency, abnormal calcium metabolism, dyslipidaemia, patient/prosthesis mismatch and bioprostheses in the mitral position.\n\n\nManagement ranges from simple monitoring in early forms to replacement of the degenerated prosthesis (either surgically or percutaneously).  \n\n[[File:Figure 6 - Bioprosthesis degeneration.jpg|thumb|Figure 6 : Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n\n===='''''Infectious endocarditis (IE)'''''====\nThis is a complication that should be systematically investigated in the event of a complication in a patient with a valve prosthesis.\n\nThe 5-year incidence of AR in valve prosthesis patients is around 5%, with the majority of events occurring in the first year following implantation.\n\nEarly postoperative AEs (<1 year after implantation) are mainly linked to \"Staphylococcus epidermitis\" or \"Aureus\".\n\nConversely, late postoperative AEs (>1 year after implantation) have a bacterial ecology similar to AEs on native valves (Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci).\n\nManagement is discussed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities, and the echocardiographic features of the IE. Antibiotic treatment is systematic, lasting at least 6 weeks, and may be combined with surgical management.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Other examples of bioprosthesis degeneration.png|alt=Bioprosthesis degeneration|thumbnail|953x953px|Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===='''''Hemorrhagic complications associated with VKAs'''''====\nThey concern patients with mechanical valves, but also patients with biological valves where curative anticoagulation is indicated (AF in particular). The risk is approximately 2% patient-years.\n\nThe symptoms vary: cerebral haemorrhage, digestive haemorrhage, haematuria, gingivorrhage, etc. A thorough clinical examination to look for any signs of seriousness is essential.\n\nManagement is the same as for an overdose of VKA (see Item 183).\n<br />",

Before 11 weeks' gestation, the incidence of foetal infection is around 90%. This frequency then decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception takes place after the rash, the risk of foetal infection is probably low, since the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia. When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major foetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.\n\nThere are two situations\n\n- '''Polymalformative syndrome''' including neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus or interventricular communication, etc.). It can be complicated by miscarriage or foetal death in utero;\n\n- Progressive congenital rubella'' which corresponds to chronic generalised viral infection. It reflects the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months: these newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 months' gestation. When it is symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed. These multi-visceral lesions may regress or leave sequelae. The long-term prognosis for congenital rubella that is symptomatic at birth is guarded, especially as regards psychomotor and auditory development.\n\nThe WHO defines congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) as follows:\n\n- A case of \"CRS\" is a child with 2 complications from group A (cataract and/or congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, pigmentary retinopathy) or 1 from group A + one from group B (purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, meningoencephalitis, bone mineralisation anomalies, early neonatal jaundice). The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for specific IgM antibodies in the neonatal period.\n\n- A case of ''CRI'' is a child who does not fit into the previous definition and who has positive specific IgM in the neonatal period.",

Scientific integrity\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=21}}\n\n= Ethical principles of research involving humans (biomedical research) = RIPH (Research Involving Humans)\nResearch involving the human person (RIPH) is no longer referred to as biomedical research.\n\nRIPH is defined as research organised and carried out on human beings, which goes beyond the act of care and the immediate interest of the patient. It may be aimed at developing biological or medical knowledge, based on procedures that modify the usual, validated treatment.\n\nIts scope covers all tests and experiments on humans, whether they involve new drugs, new surgical techniques, new diagnostic methods that are invasive or carry a potential risk, or psychological or behavioural studies.\n\nA clinical trial is a scientific study carried out in human medical therapeutics to assess the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or treatment. It comprises a preclinical phase carried out in vitro and in vivo in animals, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in four phases.\n\n= I Principles and objectives of research ethics =\n\n\nThe aim is to apply fundamental ethical principles in the field of research. The principles can be implemented by means of normative texts, such as French laws and/or universal declarations, and by validation of protocols by a body such as the Committee for the Protection of Individuals.\n\nWe need to be vigilant about the quality of information and consent prior to any research, but also about the vulnerability of certain populations, safety conditions, monitoring throughout the experiment, after approval of the protocol, and marketing. The creation of patents for the purposes of industrial development must not lead to financial conflicts of interest or inequalities in access to healthcare.\n\nFor this reason, the principles that guide ethical research concern the methodology, objectives and conditions of the study, the collection of consent, vigilance towards a vulnerable population, the integrity of the publication of results and clinical management at the end of the study.\n\nThese principles are the principle of beneficence, the principle of non-maleficence, the principle of autonomy and the principle of justice.\n\n== A Principle of beneficence\nThis involves relieving or preventing physical or psychological pain, doing what is best for the patient (including sometimes doing nothing if the anticipated benefit is minimal), and carefully assessing the risk/benefit balance of the treatment envisaged.\n\n== B Principle of non-maleficence\nThe principle of non-maleficence consists of not causing harm through research, and immediately halting any research that has irreversible or significant harmful effects. In France, the Public Health Code clearly states that \"the interests of persons who undergo medical research always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society [...]\".\n\n== C Principle of autonomy\nThe principle of autonomy consists of allowing each person the capacity to think, decide and act freely, according to their own initiative, including decisions concerning their state of health. Subjects should be treated as autonomous persons'','' to protect those whose autonomy is diminished'','' to always seek to respect the wishes of the subject and to guarantee the quality of information and the gathering of consent.\n\nUnder French law, the human body is inviolable. It is therefore impossible to carry out treatment (which would be considered an attack on the human body) if the person has not given their consent to the treatment. To give consent, the person must have been informed beforehand. For consent to be valid, it must be free (without any hierarchical, family or other pressure) and informed, meaning that the information must be complete, fair and appropriate. It is also important to ensure that the information has been understood.\n\n== D Principle of justice (or equity) ==\nIn the face of declining and scarce economic resources, it is necessary to establish priorities in order to preserve equity in access to healthcare. This access must be identical, whatever the country in which the care is provided. Within a given country, health strategies and policies must take account of this principle to determine what will be prioritised: public health or individual health. In research, the selection of subjects must be fair, while protecting vulnerable populations. There should be no exclusion or discrimination on the grounds of the subject's religious, political or ethnic background.\n\n== E Universal nature\nEthical principles are universal in nature and transcend geographical, cultural, economic, legal and political boundaries. Conversely, their application procedure is not universal and depends on the laws or regulations in force in the country concerned. For example, the marketing of patents is prohibited in France but authorised in other countries, resulting in inequalities in access to care linked to these patents.\n\n= II The emergence of research ethics =\n\n\nSince ancient times, concern and respect for the patient have been at the heart of medical practice, and the Hippocratic oath, still taken today, bears witness to this.\n\nHowever, society's view of doctors has changed. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the predominant concern was to do what was best for the patient. The doctor, who was the \"knower\", the \"savant\", made the decision that he considered best suited to his patient's case. For their part, patients (or their relatives) placed all their trust in the doctor, who appeared to be in the best position to make the therapeutic decision. The principle of beneficence prevailed and medical paternalism was at its height.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, attitudes were changing. Technologies were developing in the scientific field. Proof of effectiveness was sought in the medical, police and industrial fields. The principle of beneficence gave way to the principle of autonomy. The collection of consent was seen as legitimising research. By the end of the Second World War, the abuses had become apparent and a regulatory framework was needed. The Nuremberg Code was introduced in 1947.\n\n= III Normative texts =\n\n== A Nuremberg Code (1947) ==\nDrafted by non-medical experts following the Nuremberg trials, the Nuremberg Code establishes an international code of ethics for experimentation on human beings. The code respects the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, in the sense that research must be of benefit to society. The balance of benefits and risks to the subject must be properly assessed. The Code respects the principle of autonomy, and the basic rule is the free and informed consent of the subject, which means that the investigator must provide reliable, clear and complete information before consent is obtained. The subject's freedom is unconditional and inalienable from the beginning to the end of the study, and he or she may withdraw from the study at any time if he or she so wishes.\n\n== B Declaration of Helsinki (1964)\nIssued by the World Medical Association, the Declaration of Helsinki takes up the fundamental principles already set out in the Nuremberg Code. It establishes a distinction between clinical and non-clinical research and research for the direct benefit of patients. It states that \"the interests of science or society must never take precedence over the well-being of the subject\".\n\n== C Manila Declaration (1981)\nIssued jointly by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences, the Manila Declaration establishes the principle that the opinion of a committee of independent experts must be sought before consent can be obtained from vulnerable persons. This includes children, pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers and protected adults.\n\n== D European Directive of 4 April 2001\nThis directive incorporates the principles of the Helsinki and Manila declarations with regard to the protection of individuals. It also aims to harmonise European legislation on clinical trials on medicinal products with regard to research into the quality of trials, and to facilitate procedures and exchanges of information in the form of European databases.\n\n== E Revision of the Helsinki Declaration (2014) ==\nThis is the tenth revision of this declaration. It introduces public consultation as a working method, raises the issue of compensation for vulnerable populations and reiterates the post-study obligation to communicate overall and individual results.",

Resting tremor (or parkinsonian tremor) ===\nResting tremor (or Parkinsonian tremor) is present at rest and disappears during muscle contraction and sleep, is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, never the head or voice, is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. It is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigrostriatal pathway]] but is not mandatory for diagnosis.\n\nTremor SD-128|trembling]] can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, in particular Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome (see below).\n\nIf the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is aged over 40, no further tests are necessary.\n\nConversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.\n\n===2.  Action tremor===\n- Present when maintaining a posture ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] postural) and/or arriving at the target ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] intentional).\n\nThe most common cause of postural [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]] is essential [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]].\n\nThis is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head, which progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre) or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre), performs an action such as pouring water from one glass to another (the glass test) or holds a note aloud (voice tremor). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.\n\n===3.  Cerebellar tremor===\n- This is an action [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor).\n\n- Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test).\n\n- Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria (and not a genuine speech and/or phonation disorder) on finger-nose and heel-knee manoeuvres, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre) and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability and incoordination of movements.\n\n- Similarly, in the event of an acute cerebellar syndrome, vitamin B1 should be measured/supplemented in order to search for/treat Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy, which may be responsible for mental confusion/disorientation.\n\n- Acute drunkenness is a frequent cause of acute cerebellar syndrome and warrants prevention of alcohol-related risks.\n\n- The acute onset of a cerebellar syndrome warrants a [[request for a cerebral imaging test]] in search of a cerebellar ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, which may be the cause of compression of the fourth ventricle responsible for hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, which may also be the cause of [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]. \n\n===4.  Exaggeration of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] physiological:===\nExaggeration of the [[Trembling SD-128|trembling]] physiological: in this case there is systematically the [[suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care]] (see below). Particular circumstances (hyperthyroidism: analysis of thyroid balance with TSH measurement; excessive consumption of caffeine) may cause an exaggeration of the physiological tremor (which is a normal phenomenon, of muscular origin, not linked to an attack on the central nervous system), which may then be confused with a tremor of another nature.\n\n===5.  [[Tremor SD-128|Trumbling]] functional (or psychogenic)===\nThis is a [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that does not correspond to any neurological pathology described above. It is usually characterised by a sudden onset (often in an emotional context or in a patient with psychological fragility), distractibility (during a competing task, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] disappears or changes), frequency entrainment (during a motor task performed by the contralateral limb at a given frequency, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] tends to adopt the same frequency). It may be present both at rest and in action (which is unusual), may disappear spontaneously, and may be polymorphous and atypical (neurological abnormalities that cannot be systematised, etc.). It tends to occur in people with a history of somatisation.",

This condition is uncommon. It is indicative of advanced and diffuse atheromatous disease.\n\n*Functional signs: This is a triad associating :\n**Post prandial abdominal pain ('''''SD-004: abdominal pain'''''): This corresponds to claudication of the small intestine (mesenteric angina). It is the earliest and most constant symptom, and consists of intense cramp-like pain. It most often occurs in the periumbilical region. It begins around 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and slowly subsides over one to two hours. Its severity and duration are correlated with the quantity, calorie and fat content of the meal and the degree of malperfusion. In the early stages, only large meals trigger the pain, then as the lesions progress, the pain becomes more frequent after ingestion of a modest volume of food;\n**Eviction and food splitting: these post-prandial pains lead patients to reduce their food intake for fear of post-prandial pain.  Severe malnutrition may set in;\n**Emaciation: this is often significant and results from malnutrition.\n\nOther symptoms may be associated but are less typical: diarrhoea, vomiting.\n\n*Physical signs:\n**An abdominal murmur is inconstantly present. Clinical examination may reveal the presence of other atheromatous sites (carotid or femoral murmurs, abolition of peripheral pulses).\n\n'''Acute intestinal ischaemia'''\n\nIt is defined as the acute interruption of digestive vascularisation, in relation to acute arterial occlusion by embolism, thrombosis or dissection. It is an absolute and vital therapeutic emergency.\n\nEarly diagnosis is essential at the stage of reversible intestinal ischaemia. Acute abdominal pain occurring in a patient at risk (>60 years old, atheromatous, emboligic heart disease) should systematically raise this diagnosis, given its seriousness.\n\nThe spontaneous prognosis is extremely poor in the absence of treatment, rapidly leading to death. If blood flow is restored, the prognosis remains poor and depends on the extent of intestinal necrosis.\n\n*Functional signs\n**Abdominal pain is the most constant sign. It is a sudden and intense cramp-like pain, located in the umbilical region and in the right iliac fossa. The intensity of the pain contrasts with a poor physical examination and an initially stable general condition. In the early stages, there is often hyperperistalsis, which may manifest as diarrhoea.\n\nWithin a few hours, an intestinal obstruction develops (vomiting, defensiveness). General signs are present, with fever, progressive shock and multiple organ failure. These signs indicate the existence of an irreversible infarct.\n\n*Physical signs: A distinction can be made between :\n**A reversible acute mesenteric ischaemic syndrome characterised by very severe pain and the absence of peritoneal signs;\n**A picture of intestinal mesenteric infarction, characterised by severe permanent pain with peritoneal signs (abdominal contracture), an occlusive state and then a state of shock.",

Historically, the first prostheses consisted of a ball that moved via the blood flow inside a cage (Starr\u00ae prosthesis), followed by tilting monodisc valves (Bjork-Shiley\u00ae). They currently have a double-wing design that moves on a central axis (Saint-Jude Medical\u00ae, Carbomedics\u00ae).\n\nThe fins open during the ejection phase and close during diastole. The ring is covered with Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM</sup> to anchor the prosthesis to the biological structure.\n\nThey have excellent durability, but require long-term curative anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the prosthesis. The recommended anticoagulants are anti-vitamin K.\n\n\nBecause of this anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding, their implantation is recommended in subjects under 60 years of age in the aortic position and under 65 years of age in the mitral position (Grade IIa / Level C).\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 1 - Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis.jpg|vignette|Figure 1 : Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===='''''Biological stents'''''====\nThey are most often made from bovine pericardium (Carpentier-Edwards Perimount\u00ae, Carpentier-Edwards MagnaEase\u00ae, Medtronic Avalus\u00ae) which is mounted on a metal frame with a Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM</sup> collar. There are also bio-prostheses without a metal frame (the most commonly used is Freedom Solo - Sorin\u00ae).\n\nThere are also genuine porcine xenografts, such as the Medtronic\u00ae Hancok II. Finally, more rarely, homografts from human donors may be used.\n\nTheir durability is less than that of mechanical prostheses, with the development of stenosis or regurgitation on the valve prosthesis in the event of degeneration. Durability is estimated at between 10 and 15 years, depending on the position of the prosthesis, the type of prosthesis and the patient.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they are biocompatible. They do not require long-term anticoagulation if the patient is in sinus rhythm. In the mitral or tricuspid position, anticoagulation with VKA for the first three months following implantation (endothelialization time) is sufficient. In the aortic position, platelet anti-aggregation for the first three months following implantation (duration of endothelialization) is sufficient.\n\nTheir implantation is therefore recommended in subjects over 60 years of age in the aortic position, and over 65 years of age in the mitral position.\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 2 - Biological prosthesis.jpg|thumb|Figure 2 : Biological prosthesis]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n====''''' Percutaneous stents'''''====\nThey are most often made of porcine pericardium (Medtronic CorValve\u00ae) or bovine pericardium (Edwards Sapiens 3\u00ae) mounted on a metal stent deployed in the native aortic valve. They are currently recommended for patients with a high to intermediate operative risk (Grade I / Level B). The situation is currently evolving for patients aged over 65 with a low risk of surgery, for whom we expect the device to be validated by the learned societies in the near future.  \n\n\n[[File:Figure 3 - Percutaneous prostheses - CoreValve prosthesis (left) & Sapiens 3 prosthesis (right).jpg|vignette|''Figure 3 : Percutaneous prostheses : CoreValve prosthesis (left) &'' Prothese Sapiens 3 (right)]]\n<br />",

It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).\n\nThere are two pathophysiological phases:\n\n#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to na\u00efve LTCD8+. The na\u00efve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.\n#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification.jpg|vignette|Figure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification]]\n\n\nFigure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity according to the Gel and Coombs classification.\n\nModel of allergic contact eczema.\n\nAsymptomatic sensitisation phase (production of allergen-specific T lymphocytes on first contact)\n\nReveal phase on new contact (clinical eczema)",

The position of individuals on the social ladder influences the conditions in which they grow up, learn, live, work and age, and their vulnerability to disease and its consequences\". (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants of Health).\n\nFor example, difficulties in accessing housing or employment, a polluted and noisy living environment, the experience of exclusion or inequality... All these factors can add up to a multiplier effect.\n\nDiscrimination increases stress\n\nExperiencing discrimination contributes to the stress experienced by people who are subjected to it, which can result in poorer cardiovascular health. People exposed to ethno-racial discrimination are in poorer health according to a meta-analysis (Paradies 2015). This discrimination is a risk factor for depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, as well as for suicidal behaviour (Bardol et al. 2020). They can accumulate in people's experience and 'wear them down' (Wilkinson 2015). The accumulation of disadvantages has a corrosive dimension (Pelet, Charles and Dergham 2020).\n\nDiscrimination can also make it difficult for professionals to practise, particularly because of the tension between ethical requirements and the reality on the ground.\n\n'''Discrimination is a major contributor to non-take-up.''''\n\nNon-take-up occurs when people affected by public policies do not use the benefits or services to which they are entitled. Non-take-up is a widespread phenomenon, particularly in healthcare: in addition to factors linked to geographical distance, territorial disparities and unequal health literacy, discrimination can be a direct contributory factor. Anticipating rejection, stigmatising remarks, having to pay in advance or having to pay more, people from vulnerable populations and/or in economically precarious situations may decide not to visit a professional, delaying their treatment or worsening their state of health. In addition to encountering difficulties in accessing healthcare or facing barriers that prevent them from accessing care, some people no longer find their place in the social protection and healthcare system and no longer accept the nature of the interactions it offers (https://odenore.msh-alpes.fr/).",

It is referred to as an \"attack\" when complaints are of short duration and include a painful component, or as a chronic disease when signs are regular. Symptoms are usually accompanied by a morphological change in the haemorrhoids, but there is no anatomo-clinical correlation (people can complain of small haemorrhoids, or have large haemorrhoids without feeling them). The pathogenesis of haemorrhoidal disease is only partially understood. There are two theories that lead to a normal, asymptomatic anatomical component becoming symptomatic: the mechanical theory and the vascular theory.\n\n- The mechanical theory is based on a weakening of the support tissue or anchoring material of the internal haemorrhoids: long bowel movements, straining (dyschesia), changes in stool consistency (hard stools) and childbirth are risk factors for the onset of haemorrhoidal signs. Many patients express the fact that the onset of signs of haemorrhoidal disease coincides with childbirth.\n\n- Vascular theory likens haemorrhoidal disease to venous insufficiency. However, haemorrhoids are not veins (they do not have congenital valves) and the red bleeding of a haemorrhoidal crisis is not venous. However, the increase in size of haemorrhoidal tissue at the end of pregnancy and the short-term effectiveness of so-called veinotonic treatments support this hypothesis.\n\nCf item ''[[2C-288-ET-B01]]''''",

This pressure will naturally decrease from the ankle to the thigh due to the morphology of the limb. Its action involves a haemodynamic (venous trunks) and microcirculatory effect. It is most effective when applied in the morning, within an hour of getting up. Its application sometimes requires the use of devices to aid donning or the assistance of a third party.\n\nThere are 4 classes of elastic compression socks, stockings and tights, depending on the pressure exerted on the ankle (between 10 and 15 mmHg: class I; between 15.1 and 20 mmHg: class II; between 20.1 and 36 mmHg: class III; > 36 mmHg: class IV). The indications are summarised in the table below, which is based on the 2010 HAS recommendations. Functional CVI is an indication for class I compression. Lymphatic insufficiency is an indication for class IV compression.\n\nThe contraindications to elastic compression are: obliterative arterial disease with SPI < 0.60; septic venous thrombosis; phlegmatia caerulae; diabetic microangiopathy with TcPO2 < 30 mmHg.\n\nRegular reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio of compression is essential in cases of : OAMI with SPI between 0.60 and 0.90; advanced peripheral neuropathy; oozing or eczematous dermatosis; intolerance to the fibres used.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Clinical situation\n!Devices\n!Methods\n|-\n|Varicose veins > 3 mm\n| Socks, thigh-highs, pantyhose\n\n- Class II or III\n|Long-term\n|-\n|After sclerotherapy, heat treatment or stripping (varies according to team)\n| Lower thigh\n- Class II or III\n|4 to 6 weeks (varies according to team)\n|-\n|Chronic oedema of venous origin\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Long-term\n\nRegular re-evaluation\n\nthe benefit/risk ratio\n|-\n|Pigmentation, eczema\n\nvenous\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Lipodermatosclerosis,\n\nvenous hypodermatitis,\n\nwhite atrophy\n| - Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Healed ulcer\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV\n|-\n|Open ulcer\n|<Multi-type bandages as first-line treatment</nowiki>.\n\n- Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV (maximum tolerated)\n|Until healing\n\ncomplete\n|}\n\n==''Drug treatment'''==\nVenotonic drugs are only prescribed in cases of functional symptoms (discomfort, heaviness in the legs) and as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle and elastic compression. They are prescribed sequentially for short periods.\n\n==Sclerotherapy, endovenous thermal techniques and surgery ==\nThese treatments are indicated for symptomatic varicose veins and aim to \"destroy\" the pathological veins. The indication must also take into account the patient's condition. In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or atheromatous disease (coronary artery disease, obliterative arterial disease, etc.), the venous capital should be preserved as far as possible so that it can be used for arterial bypass surgery at a later date, in the absence of major varicose veins. Varicose veins secondary to a post-thrombotic syndrome should generally be respected, as they can compensate for deep vein obstruction; treatment should be on a case-by-case basis if superficial venous insufficiency aggravates deep venous insufficiency.\n\nThe choice of technique depends on the location, appearance and diameter of the varicose veins.\n\n===''Sclerotherapy'''===\nSclerotherapy involves the percutaneous injection of a sclerosing agent (liquid or foam) into a varicose vein. The injection can be carried out under ultrasound control (= echosclerotherapy). It may be carried out alone or in conjunction with another technique.\n\nThe endothelial inflammation generated will lead to fibrous and retractile scarring of the treated vein.\n\nIt is widely indicated from CEAP stage C2 upwards.\n\nThe possible complications should not, however, lead to this treatment being trivialised (haematoma, sequelae of pigmentation and intra-arterial injection, which is particularly serious but exceptional). The benefit/risk balance must therefore be carefully assessed in mild forms of CVI, and patients must be given full information.\n\n===''Endovenous thermal techniques'''===\nEndovenous thermal techniques (laser or radiofrequency) have replaced traditional surgical techniques. When feasible, they are the first-line treatment when sclerotherapy is not indicated. They can be carried out without a general anaesthetic and allow patients to resume physical and professional activity as quickly as possible. It consists of destroying the venous wall using heat after an anaesthetic has been applied around the vein to be treated.\n\n===''Surgery'''===\nThe indications for surgery are becoming increasingly limited. The most common techniques are stripping and phlebectomy.\n\nStripping is indicated in extensive and tortuous forms and requires a general or loco-regional anaesthetic and time off work.\n\nPhlebectomies consist of removing segments of superficial varicose veins by micro-incisions in the skin under local anaesthetic. Phlebectomies can be performed in stages, respecting the saphenous trunk.\n\n==='''Crenotherapy or spa treatment'''===\nCrenotherapy may be proposed as an adjuvant treatment in certain targeted cases which remain symptomatic after medical or interventional treatment (CVI with significant skin repercussions, disabling post-thrombotic syndrome, disabling lymphoedema).",

In this situation, it can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided that it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and must demonstrate that it has identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator. This is demonstrated in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may, however, contain excipients that are different from those of the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, colour and taste of a generic drug may also be different from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.\n\n==Authorisation of generic medicinal products ==\nGeneric medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. In practice, marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine on the basis of the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. The latter type of study must be randomised, cross-over and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin (medicines for which a small variation in concentration will modify the effect of the medicine), the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.\n\n==''Substitution of a generic drug'''==\nGeneric drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.\n\nAs prescriptions must be in INN, the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine are authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic.\n\nThe prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must take account of the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:\n\n*In particular, if the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.\n*If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed.\n\n==Refusal to substitute ==\nUnder very specific conditions, requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, he/she must write \"non-substitutable\" on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in 3 situations:\n\n*Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.\n*Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product in the event that this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.\n*Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.\n\nPharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled \"non-substitutable\" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.\n\n==''Biosimilar medicinal product'''==\nA biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, the complexity of the molecule and the difficulty involved in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.\n\n==Authorisation of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBiosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.\n\nIf a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g. marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n==Interchangeability of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBy definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment, but requires: informing the patient and obtaining his or her consent; recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file; and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",

This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which consists of appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests. This measure must be proportionate and individualised, and must be introduced and implemented with respect for the protected person's freedoms, rights and dignity.\n\nThe 2007 law reforming the legal protection of adults strengthened the fundamental rights of protected persons. For example, the person concerned must be heard during the procedure for placing them under guardianship. The 2019 Act also strengthened the rights of protected adults, by promoting their autonomy wherever possible. Protected persons must receive from the person in charge of their protection measure, in a manner appropriate to their condition, all information concerning them [[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\n'''Protection of persons of full age''' :\n\nA person who has reached the age of majority is legally considered to be capable of carrying out all acts of civil life.\n\nHowever, a legal protection measure may be put in place when a person finds it impossible to look after his or her own interests, due to a medically certified impairment of his or her mental and/or physical faculties.\n\nPeople can anticipate their loss of autonomy by drawing up a future protection mandate. This enables people to choose in advance who will be responsible for protecting their interests when they are no longer able to do so.\n\n'''Protection of minors:''''\n\nA minor child may be placed under guardianship, whereby a person helps to protect the child's interests. Guardianship is opened when the holders of parental authority (the child's parents) can no longer exercise it (because the child has no parents, they are deceased, or their parental authority has been withdrawn).\n\n'''Protecting people with disabilities:''''\n\nParents can take steps to protect the interests of their child (minor or adult) with a disability when they are no longer able to do so.\n\nThis protective measure begins when the parents die or are no longer able to care for their child.\n\nIf the child is a minor, the parents can apply for guardianship of minors to protect his or her interests. If the child is of full age, they can use the future protection mandate.\n\n'''Rights of protected patients of full age:'''\n\n'''''The rights of adult patients under court protection and guardianship:'''''\n\nAdults under court protection or guardianship exercise their rights personally and receive information relating to their state of health directly. The curator may only receive this information from the doctor if the protected person authorises him to do so.\n\nLike any other patient, a protected adult must personally consent to the medical procedure under consideration. Consent may be withdrawn at any time and refusal must be respected, except in emergencies.\n\nMedical records are released at the patient's request, using the same procedure as for other adults.\n\n'''''The rights of adult patients under guardianship:'''''\n\nMedical information is given to the guardian. Once the guardian has access to information about the protected person's health, he or she must respect medical confidentiality. However, the adult under guardianship has the right to receive the information directly and to participate in the decision-making process concerning him or her. This information and this participation in the decision will then be adapted to the faculties of the protected person.\n\nThe consent of adults under guardianship must be systematically sought if they are able to express their wishes and participate in decisions concerning them. Consent may be revoked at any time. The consent of the legal representative alone must remain exceptional. In addition, except in emergencies, the guardian may not, without the judge's authorisation, take a decision that would seriously affect the integrity of the protected person or the privacy of his or her private life. Lastly, the doctor has the right to provide essential care if the guardian refuses, which could have serious consequences for the health of the protected adult.\n\nIn a guardianship situation, in principle, the medical file cannot be communicated to the protected person, but only to the guardian as his legal representative. However, it is the guardian's responsibility, as far as possible, to inform the protected adult of the contents of the medical file.\n\n\n[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text borrows from several documents published by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Solidarity, Autonomy and the Disabled and the Ministry of Health and Prevention, and from consultations on justice.fr, solidarit\u00e9s-sant\u00e9.gouv.fr, service-public.fr.\n\n[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote2anc|2]] For further information, consult the \"Charter of rights and freedoms of protected adults\".",

Stems from the work of Ivan Pavlov on conditioning, and Aaron Beck on cognitivism. Postulates that patients' symptoms stem from inappropriate learned behaviour, dysfunctional cognition and/or difficulties in emotional regulation. CBT then proposes to identify these behaviours, thoughts and emotions and to find alternative adaptive strategies.\n\n- Psychoanalytic psychotherapy: includes both analytically inspired psychotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis. Stems from the work of Sigmund Freud. Postulates that patients' problems are based on unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.\n\n- Family/systemic therapies: consider the family or couple as a dynamic system whose members are in continuous interaction. The patient's symptoms (\"designated patient\", \"symptom carrier\") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs to be rebalanced by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.\n\n- Therapeutic education: therapeutic patient education \"aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease.  It includes organised activities designed to make patients aware of and informed about their illness and care\" (HAS).\n\n- Cognitive remediation: an approach based on neurology, neuropsychology and rehabilitation, enabling patients to improve their cognitive functioning and thus their quality of life.",

To understand the definition and role of the trusted support person.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=\n|Order=20}}\n\n== I- Evolution of the rule of law and the law on the end of life ==\nTo understand what is at stake and how the end of life is dealt with, we need to know how society's view of the issue has evolved, as reflected in changes in the law.\n\n* The circular of 26 August 1986: the \"Laroque\" circular, relating to the organisation of care and support for terminally ill patients, defined palliative care for the first time in France, which it called \"support care\", as \"aimed at meeting the specific needs of people who have reached the end of their lives\";\n\n* <nowiki>The law of 9 June 1999 aimed at guaranteeing the right of access to palliative care: it opens up the right to palliative care and support to \"any sick person whose condition so requires\". Article 1 defines palliative care as \"active and continuous care provided by an interdisciplinary team in an institution or at home, [which] aims to relieve pain, alleviate physical suffering, safeguard the dignity of the sick person and support those around them\".\n\n* The law of 4 March 2002, known as the \"Kouchner law\", on patients' rights, places the individual at the centre of the decision-making process concerning him or her. The law stipulates that \"all persons, together with their healthcare professional and taking into account the information and recommendations provided by the latter, make decisions concerning their health\" and specifies that \"no medical procedure or treatment may be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person concerned\". Doctors are also obliged to inform patients about their state of health, treatments and their possible consequences. This law also introduces the possibility of appointing a \"trusted support person\", who must be consulted if the patient is unable to express his or her opinion.\n\n* The law of 22 April 2005, known as the \"L\u00e9onetti law\", relating to patients' rights and the end of life, reaffirms the right of every person \"to refuse or not to receive treatment\" or not to refuse unreasonable obstinacy. It recognises the possibility for doctors, in the name of the same principle, to limit or stop care and/or to apply a treatment that may have the secondary effect of shortening life, if they \"establish that they cannot relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease\" (this is known as the double effect), provided that they inform the patient, the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, one of the next of kin. It gives these people the right to request that their treatment be limited or stopped, and obliges doctors to respect their wishes \"after informing them of the consequences of their choice\". It states that any person of legal age may \"draw up advance directives in the event that he or she should one day be unable to express his or her wishes\", which \"indicate the person's wishes regarding the conditions for limiting or stopping treatment at the end of his or her life\". The doctor must take these into account when making any decision \"provided that they were drawn up less than three years before the person became unconscious\".\n\n* The law of 2 February 2016, known as the \"Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law\", creates new rights for patients and people at the end of life. If the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, the law requires the doctor to \"ascertain the patient's expressed wishes\" (art. 10), in particular through the use of advance directives and the trusted support person where these exist.\tIt introduces the right to \"deep and continuous sedation\" for a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease, when \"their vital prognosis is at risk in the short term [and they] are experiencing suffering that is refractory to treatment\", or when their decision to stop treatment \"involves their vital prognosis in the short term and is likely to result in unbearable suffering\". Deep and continuous sedation is the name given to the care process that consists of using medication to relieve pain. It involves a reduction or loss of the patient's consciousness. Under this law, euthanasia and assisted suicide remain prohibited in France.\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n* Limitation means refraining from using means likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. This means not undertaking certain life-prolonging treatments which are technically possible but which do not aim to improve the patient's condition;\n* Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment: this is the suspension of life-sustaining treatment in progress, for example artificial respiration.\n\nIn all cases, the issue of information and consent is central. A decision may or may not be taken at the patient's request, and it is essential to know the patient's feelings and last wishes. Two situations must be distinguished and discussed:\n\n* When the patient has made a request or is able to take part in the discussion with the team;\n* When the patient has not expressed anything, or can no longer express anything, and the request comes from relatives (questioning the patient's wishes and challenging the concept of autonomy).\n\nWhen patients are unconscious or have reduced capacity for expression and comprehension, incorporating the patient's opinion and consent into decision-making is highly problematic. There are several possible approaches:\n\n* Advance directives are a way for mentally competent people, who have lost their capacity to express themselves, to establish in advance and in writing how they would like to be treated in the event of hospitalisation. Among other things, they can concern end-of-life decisions, meaning that the person can specify the type of decision they would like to be made. But it is still rare for patients to write one;\n* The testimony of relatives or the trusted support person: this testimony is necessary, but it raises questions (which relatives? how reliable? how hierarchical are these relatives?).\n\nIn all cases, by law and in accordance with good professional practice, healthcare professionals have a duty to act collegially. The limitation or cessation of treatment cannot be carried out unless a collegial procedure has been followed between professionals and the patient's advance directives have been taken into account (if they exist) or the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, a close relative has been consulted.\n\nEach stage of the reasoned decision to limit or stop treatment must be recorded in the medical record.\n\n== II- Place and role of the trusted support person at the end of life ==\nIn addition to optimising the patient's right to information, other rights have led to the introduction of new practices to improve the relationship between carers and patients.\n\nThe right to appoint a trusted support person was enshrined in the French Public Health Code following the law of 4 March 2002.\n\nFor a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the \"trusted support person\" in the \"health democracy\" law of 4 March 2002.\n\nThe role of the trusted support person, in its original sense, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically and to act as a link with the medical teams. In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.\n\nThis primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still only perceived as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person has to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is to provide support during the course of standard care.\n\n== III- Drawing up end-of-life advance directives ==\nThe law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life introduced the possibility of refusing care if it appears to be \"useless, disproportionate or having no effect other than the artificial maintenance of life\". This refusal takes the form of stopping or limiting curative or palliative care, resulting in the patient's death in the more or less short term. This approach, authorised by law, has been described as a \"right to die\". Law no. 2016-87 of 2 February 2016, known as the \"end of life\" law, is a development of the 2005 law and strengthens the rights of patients at the end of life, and specifies the important role that advance directives can play.\n\nIn an end-of-life situation, in ethical terms, the decisive factor is the patient's degree of autonomy of thought, which is the true criterion for qualifying his or her ability to develop a coherent and considered argument in the face of such a decision.\n\nIn practice, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1) If the patient is aware and capable of taking part in a deliberative process, supported by the acquisition of sufficient knowledge about their illness and how it is progressing (transmitted by the doctor), they will be involved in this decision. The doctor and patient then engage in a complex and intimate exchange in which the patient expresses his inability to fight any further and his wish not to prolong his life. In this way, a dialogue can be established which, over time, can confirm the legitimacy and reality of a request to end life. The doctor can then act on the request, following in-depth discussion and reflection with the patient.\n\n2) For patients who are unable to express their wishes, there is a broad consensus on the importance of seeking their opinion so that it can be included in the decision. This is why the 2005 law states that \"when a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, the doctor may decide to limit or stop treatment that is useless or incapable of improving the patient's condition, after respecting the collegial procedure and consulting the trusted support person, the family and, where appropriate, the patient's advance directives\". To come closer to respecting the patient's wishes, the concept of testifying to what the person would have wished is used here. This testimony may be given in writing by the patient (advance directives), or verbally by those close to the patient, in particular the trusted support person (if the patient has designated one).\n\nThe principle of advance directives originated in the United States, also known as living wills, at the end of the 1960s, to enable patients' opinions to be incorporated into the end-of-life decision-making process. In 1990, the Patient Self Determination Act, passed by the US Congress, made it compulsory for patients to be informed of these advance directives on admission to all hospitals. It also obliges professionals to systematically check whether or not their patients have drawn up such documents, and to indicate this in their medical records.  In France, a survey in 2000 revealed that only 6% of patients undergoing life-sustaining treatment (LATA) in intensive care had advance directives or had designated a contact person (equivalent to a trusted support person) authorised to represent them. This is why the 2005 law introduced this system, with the aim of ensuring that professionals offer it to patients, without imposing it, and are obliged to find out whether any directives have been drawn up when they decide to stop or limit treatment.\n\nThe changes made to the law in 2016 were necessary to reiterate that refusing any treatment at the end of life is the patient's right and that his or her wishes must be respected. This is why the aim was to strengthen and clarify the role of advance directives. It should be emphasised that, from now on, this law will establish a hierarchy in terms of the ways in which a patient's wishes can be traced: firstly, the advance directives, then failing that, the testimony of the trusted support person, and failing that, any other testimony from the family or close friends.\n\nBut questions remain, particularly when patients have not drawn up advance directives, or when these are not adapted to the clinical situation, or when a trusted support person has not been designated, or when relatives disagree. In all these situations, teams must continue to work towards dialogue and ethical discussion in the name of the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.  \n\n\n\n'''What the law on the end of life emphasises:'''\n\n- The idea is for all professionals to be able to discuss this law on the end of life, advance directives and their place in relation to the trusted support person, at the appropriate time, depending on how the illness is progressing, with their patients.\n\n- An obligation on healthcare professionals to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that every person has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible alleviation of suffering.\n\n- Recognition of a patient's right to stop or limit treatment as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n- An obligation for the doctor to respect the patient's wish to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing the patient of the consequences of his or her choices and their seriousness.\n\n- A greater role for doctors in informing patients about the possibility of drawing up advance directives and/or appointing a trusted support person.\n\n- The need for collegial decision-making.\n\n- The fact that the advance directives enshrined in the law are now enforceable, meaning that the referring doctors of an unconscious patient must follow the perspectives written in this document if they are appropriate to the medical situation.\n\n- The fact that there is a hierarchy concerning the means of tracing a patient's wishes: first of all the advance directives, then failing that the testimony of the trusted support person, then failing that any other testimony from the family or close friends.

Identify a [[Headache SD-118|headache]]=\n- '''Adult and child of talking age''': the patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.\n\n- Infants and small children: atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilisation of the head, or on the contrary a prostrate, analgesic attitude.\n\n=2.     Reasoning when faced with a headache=\n- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.\n\n- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)\n\n- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?\n\n- '''Other features:'''\n\n- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)\n\n- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days\n\n- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)\n\n- Triggering and aggravating factors\n\n- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)\n\n- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated\n\n- '''Context of occurrence:'''\n\n- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors\n\n- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?\n\n- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)\n\n- '''Associated signs:'''\n\n- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]\n\n- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia\n\n- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]\n\n- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles\n\n- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]\n\n- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses\n\n- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month\n\n=4.

To be familiar with the law of 4 March 2002 on the rights of patients, the principle of respect for patients' wishes and the concept of free and informed consent.\n|Rubrique=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=5}} '''I. Autonomy, information and consent'''\n\nToday, as a result of the democratisation of our healthcare system and patients' desire to share access to medical knowledge, their demand to participate in the care process is growing, raising the question of the need to provide them with quality information, to obtain their consent and therefore to respect their freedom of choice. As a result, medical practice has become a field in which respect for patient autonomy is now central, through patient participation in the decisions that concern them, recognised as a right (when this is not made impossible by a state of great vulnerability, an emergency or a loss of psychological autonomy linked to the illness).\n\nThe principle of autonomy stems philosophically from the period of so-called modern philosophy in the 17th century, which prefigured the philosophy of the Enlightenment in the 18th century. In his Discourse on Method, Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body. This is the condition of freedom. This condition, which enables every person to judge what is right or good for them, is based on the act of the mind. The subject's autonomy can then be understood as the individual freedom to have singular preferences through internal deliberation based on a capacity for analysis. In the sense of Jean Jacques Rousseau, this translates into a social contract, where individuals acquire rights within the framework of the common law, these rights allowing freedom of thought, freedom of belief and freedom to choose one's destiny.\n\nIn the field of healthcare, the application of such an area of patient freedom has historically been ignored. For a very long time, medical decisions were taken without the patient's consent, or even without informing him or her.  This attitude was described as paternalistic, and since the 1970s there has been a legitimate demand to involve patients in the choices that concern them. According to Nilstum's definition, paternalism consisted of treating others in accordance with what was considered to be the good of others, rarely subordinating to this good any preferences, whether expressed or not, of these others. In clinical practice today, recognition of patient autonomy is reflected in a shared construction of the medical decision. This approach is commonly referred to as the co-decision process. It is based on the recognition of autonomy and is developed through an approach that now requires healthcare providers to inform and take into account the patient's questions, wishes and values.\n\nThis autonomy must be recognised, but sometimes it cannot be considered an absolute, either because the patient is losing his autonomy and therefore his ability to analyse and make decisions, or because the demands he might make in the name of his freedom cannot be reconciled with the values or organisation of our healthcare system or our society.\n\nPrior to any diagnostic or therapeutic approach, respect for patient autonomy must be reflected in a duty to provide information before obtaining consent. Consent that is not preceded by high-quality information is not legitimate.\n\nThis respect for patient autonomy has been enshrined in French legislation, first in a law governing biomedical research in 1988, and then in the bioethics laws since 1994. These laws address the issue of information and consent in specific cases, such as biomedical research, organ donation, medically assisted procreation and genetic testing, all areas in which information and consent must be given and collected in writing. Then, in 2002, the law on patients' rights and the quality of the healthcare system, known as the law of 4 March 2002, recognised the right to information and consent in all healthcare practices.\n\nPatients need, and have the right, to be informed about the choice of examinations or treatments that concern them first and foremost in their body and in their experience, because they concern their life and their conception of it. Patients should be provided with all the information they need to make their own choices, as it is ultimately up to them to decide whether or not to exercise their autonomy.\n\nAt the heart of these developments lies the way in which patients are informed. This issue is unquestionably at the heart of the notion of professional responsibility and the way in which we conceive of a patient's autonomy. The more complete the information provided, including all the uncertainties and doubts, the more the professional reinforces the patient's autonomy of decision, even if this means making the path to the patient's choice more complex. So providing information is not neutral.\n\nThe information process relies on the patient's ability to understand the medical discourse. Here we can really talk about \"understanding\", in the etymological sense of the term: the patient \"takes with him\" the information he is given, confronts it with his own experiences and fears, and gives a picture of his illness with which he can live and which will form the basis of his dialogue with the doctor.\n\nThe duty to inform therefore covers two levels:\n\n- the first is ethical, where patient autonomy in the healthcare relationship is increasingly recognised and promoted as the democratic basis for respecting and protecting individuals;\n\n- the second is of a legal nature, resulting in the obligation to provide high-quality information to enable patients to accept or refuse treatment in an informed manner.\n\nIn practice, as far as the form of information is concerned, it should above all be given orally by the healthcare professional, who should take the time necessary to ensure that each patient understands it properly, depending on their condition and difficulties. This can be helped by providing the patient with appropriate educational documents. Apart from the specific cases provided for by law (organ donation in the case of a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.\n\nTo achieve this, quality information must meet a number of objectives:\n\n   - ensure that information is provided in accordance with the principles of transparency and integrity, based on current scientific and medical data;\n\n   - inform the patient about the benefits and risks, based on validated data and, where appropriate, setting out the areas of uncertainty;\n\n   - Over and above the benefits and risks, shed light on :\n\n   - the course of care,\n\n   - physical and psychological inconvenience in everyday life,\n\n   - the organisation of the care pathway over time and the organisational constraints involved,\n\n   - the social rights of the sick person and the help and support available if necessary;\n\n   - participate in the choice between two or more medical approaches when they are validated alternatives compatible with the patient's situation.\n\n\n      II. Refusal of care''\n\nEthical debate about refusing care is fairly frequent within teams, and sometimes the concept of autonomy on which the patient's attitude is based raises questions. A patient's refusal to accept care can offend carers who have been trained to think of their actions in terms of an essential value of care: acting on behalf of others, sometimes in their place, in the name of beneficence. Sometimes, the teams are confronted with situations where refusal appears contrary not only to medical logic, but also to what they consider to be the best interests of the patient. In other circumstances, however, the patient's refusal of care will be in line with the medical team's opinion. This will be the case at the end of life, when the patient asks for care to be limited or discontinued to avoid unreasonable obstinacy; this falls within the scope of the so-called Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law on the end of life, which authorises such procedures.\n\nRefusal of care raises questions about the concept of autonomy.  The clinical context can generate or reveal a loss of autonomy, well beyond the major cases of geriatrics or psychiatry. This raises two questions:\n\n- Trying to determine whether or not the patient's formulation of a refusal is an act of will, based on a capacity for deliberative autonomy, including receiving and understanding information about the nature of the medical proposal and all the consequences of its implementation, but also of its non-implementation.\n\n- Consider whether the patient's word should be accepted as such or not.\n\nIf the patient's words are accepted outright, it is because they are considered to be an acceptable choice (often because the clinical situation and the medical assessment are in line with the wishes expressed by the patient). On the other hand, a patient's refusal may give rise to a care attitude aimed at giving time and not accepting the refusal de facto; this time is then used to provide explanations and discuss the matter again with the patient.\n\nAccepting a refusal of care too easily would be tantamount to denying the dimension of nursing work which is the accompaniment towards acceptance and a shared decision. In many clinical situations, refusal of care is simply a point of call or a clinical sign of psychological deficiency, suffering or despair, all of which it is the mission of medicine to combat so that the patient can get better and live better. The ethical question, then, is how far we are entitled to go in this process, between explaining and convincing, without forcing. In all cases, the question of time is important, because assessing these situations requires a relationship with others and regular, in-depth exchanges between people, which are essential in view of the consequences of the decisions to be taken.\n\nIn this context, medicine finds itself at the heart of an expertise that can guide the fate of individuals. The aim is to analyse the individual's ability to exercise an autonomy that is deemed valid: a formidable task! In practice, a medical team explores a certain number of abilities:\n\n- That the patient understands and integrates the information and understands the consequences of attitudes on his or her life,\n\n- That the subject is endowed with memory (that he can remember) and that he is capable of making a decision, sticking to it and voluntarily maintaining his decision (in the sense of maintaining a will by using reason).\n\nIn clinical terms, this assessment leads to a gradient of situations ranging from major impairment to minor impairment. The question then arises as to what weight each 'non-autonomy' should have in order to accept or not accept that medical teams go beyond the patient's wishes. A reading of the arguments in the ethics of decision making suggests that, in certain situations, the medical decision will be based above all on beneficence, particularly in situations of impaired autonomy. Once this has been established, in order to act in this way we need to consider the grounds for acting against the opinion expressed by the patient:\n\n- The concept of expected benefit (or expected improvement), which is the result of a benefit/risk assessment;\n\n- Implementing an approach that excludes physical violence that is traumatic for the patient and the team;\n\n- Maintaining a relationship that upholds the patient's dignity.\n\nGiven the complexity of this type of decision for a doctor, a carer and an entire team, it is customary to advocate a three-stage medical decision based on the principle of collegiality:\n\na) The time that precedes, and enables the case to be investigated, as in a court of law, in a collegial manner within the framework of an ethic of discussion; this time can be long, and reserves a space for argumentation between a normative level of knowledge and the decision-making level adapted to reality, i.e. to the patient's individual situation. In this context, individual decisions by a single professional should be avoided;\n\nb) The time when the decision must be taken by a clearly designated individual, driven by an \"intimate collective conviction\". Validation of the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice must guide this conviction;\n\nc) The time after the decision, when it is imperative to continue the discussion in order to take responsibility for and monitor developments, to continue or to reconsider.\n\nThis time must be respected and valued in the organisation of care teams.\n\nBut there are situations in which refusing care can be resisted or refused.\n\nFirst of all, we should mention the particular situation of an immediate life-threatening emergency, where the patient may have expressed a refusal of care verbally or, even more so, in writing, even though he or she was not in an end-of-life situation. The classic example is the suicidal patient. There is now a consensus that, in this case, as long as medical action can be taken, it should be, since there is a life-threatening emergency accompanied by impaired discernment.\n\nThus, except in an end-of-life situation where the patient has made his or her choice known orally or via advance directives (living will) or via the trusted support person, the prevailing idea in an emergency situation is that the person should be saved.\n\nThis is easily illustrated, for example, by the case of a young diabetic teenager who, refusing to continue insulin therapy because of a family conflict, ended up in an acid-ketotic coma with a life-threatening prognosis. In an extreme conception of respect for autonomy, we could choose, in all cases, to defer to the patient's choice; But accepting a refusal of care too easily and without debate or questioning would mean denying situations where a patient's verbalisation does not necessarily reflect the complexity of his or her thinking, or even means a cry for help, a request to be listened to differently, for a different way of providing care - all situations where the care provider's job must be to connect the patient to a care approach that is better adapted to his or her situation and which, in the end, will be positive for him or her.\n\nThere is also a final case of refusal of care: that which exposes the other person or raises questions in terms of public health.\n\nMany situations fall into this category: Opposition to vaccinations; refusal to accept prophylactic treatment for meningitis or anti-tuberculosis treatment which may increase the risk to the community, a family or a spouse; refusal of a medically justified caesarean section, which puts the life of the mother or even the child at risk; refusal of an essential transfusion which involves a risk of after-effects, disability or death... In these cases, there is a real conflict of values, with healthcare professionals asserting their decisions on the basis that medical practice cannot be degraded, especially when other interests are at stake beyond the patient's (an unborn child, a family or the community).\n\nThere is also a need for medicine to prevent, treat and provide assistance in a way that is based on the public good, and not on formal respect for individual convictions by which patients mark their differences with the community, possibly to the detriment of themselves and others. An autonomist, individualist approach would legitimise the refusal of vaccinations (although beneficial to the community as a whole, it loses its meaning if not everyone agrees to it), the refusal of a caesarean section because of a mother's choice (to the detriment of the child), the refusal to save the father or mother of a child in the name of a belief or religion (certainly putting at risk the balance of the family but also collective solidarity with those who remain dependent), the refusal of care during serious epidemics (putting at risk the lives of other people), etc.\n\nThus, in a universal understanding of medicine, it is difficult to see patients as having rights but no duties. An autonomist view, taken to the extreme, would respect these endangerments, regarding them as a right and placing the patient in the position of a user, or even a client, imposing his or her choices on the healthcare professional, who is then seen as a service provider. Our analysis should be set against the writings of Hans Georg Gadamer in Philosophy of Health, where he reminds us that the ethics of responsibility can thwart individual convictions, and that the common good is at stake. In the light of his analysis, a healthcare system must be able to define rules and duties applicable to all; in return, everyone receives rights: social protection, equal access to care. What would we say about a system that allowed air travellers to object, on individual grounds, to the landing rules and instruments applied by an airline pilot? If health were to become a simple matter of consumerism governed by such individual choices, far removed from the complex notions we have just set out and the representations of the social bond, then the ethical aim of medicine would have to be redefined. We would then have to ask ourselves whether it would not then be contrary to the ethical aim defined by Paul Ricoeur as \"the aim of the good life, with and for others, in just institutions\".",

Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.\n\n- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics\n\n- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal and cardiac complications.\n<br />\n\n=== '''Indications''' ===\n- Fever: low dose\n\n- Pain:\n\no ''Acute pain'': dental pain, ''postoperative pain'', ''post-traumatic pain'', ''headaches'' or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.\n\no Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.\n\n- inflammation: higher dosage\n\nacute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, ''spinal pain'' and ''radicular pain'' and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.\n\n- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.\n\n\n=== '''Contraindications''' ===\n- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.\n\n- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).\n\n- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).\n\n- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.\n\n- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.\n\n- Haemorrhagic diseases.\n\n- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===\nVirtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's \"terrain\" and any associated medications.\n\n==== 1. Digestive side effects ====\n- frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)\n\n- gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.\n\n- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).\n\nRisk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs\n\n- '''Elderly subject''': age > 65.\n\n- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage or Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\n- Severe co-morbidities.\n\n- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.\n\n- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n- active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis\n<br />\n\n==== 2.    Renal complications ====\n- Acute functional renal failure: especially in elderly patients or those suffering from hypovolaemia.\n\nThe risk factors are :\n\n- treatment with diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists;\n\n- dehydration ;\n\n- dehydrated diet ;\n\n- heart failure.\n\n- High blood pressure due to fluid retention\n\n- Chronic renal failure (chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy)\n<br />\n\n==== 3.    Cardiovascular complications ====\n- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.\n\n- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.\n\n- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n<br />\n\n==== 4.    Allergic complications ====\n- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)\n\n- Bronchospasm\n<br />\n\n==== 5.    Gynaecological and obstetric complications ====\n- Tocolytic activity\n\n- Foetus: premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal failure from the sixth month of pregnancy.\n\n- Reduced fertility\n<br />\n\n==== 6.

The prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of ''renal insufficiency'', including with topical cutaneous forms.\n\n9.    Avoid NSAIDs in the acute phase of a viral or bacterial infection.\n\n10.

('''''[[Preoperative explanations and consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]]''''')\n**[[File:Embolectomy.jpg|vignette]]In the case of embolism in a healthy artery, embolectomy with a Fogarty probe is the surgical method of choice.\n**In the case of thrombosis in a pathological artery, revascularisation is performed using conventional techniques (endarterectomy, bypass surgery) and/or endovascular techniques (recanalisation, angioplasty, thromboaspiration, in situ thrombolysis), depending on the type of lesion. Caution: intra-arterial in situ thrombolysis administered over 12 to 24 hours is contraindicated in patients with sensory-motor ischaemia because it takes too long to take effect.\n**In the event of late revascularisation or aorto-iliac thrombosis, limb lavage should be discussed in order to prevent the systemic effects of the release of products of muscle catabolism into the general circulation (revascularisation syndrome).\n**Limb amputation may be performed immediately when ischaemia has been overcome, or secondarily to control the major metabolic disorders of a revascularisation syndrome, or after revascularisation has failed.\n*''to correct pathological processes aggravating ischaemia'''\n**A leg aponevrotomy will be performed in cases of acute compartment syndrome (muscular oedema as a reaction to revascularisation, within the inextensible aponeurotic envelope of the leg).
