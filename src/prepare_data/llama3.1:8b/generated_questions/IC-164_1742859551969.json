Facial oedema may be present\n\nOther signs and symptoms may be associated, such as hepatomegaly and hepatalgia, and more rarely jaundice.\n\nEBV infection can also present as a prolonged fever, particularly in young children.\n\nSymptoms vary in duration, and adolescents may experience marked asthenia.\n\n\n'''Biologically'''\n\n'''Mononucleosis syndrome [[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|(Leukocyte abnormality SD-216]]''', sometimes thrombocytopenia\n\nHepatic cytolysis [[Hep|frequent]]\n\nDiagnosis is based on \"serology\" and the presence of anti-VCA IgM without anti-EBNA IgG.\n\n\n'''Complications/seriousness'''\n\n-Obstructive ENT: linked to tonsillar and adenoid hypertrophy, and rare but possible superinfection: sinuses, middle ear, cavum,\n\n-Rarer complications: cardiac (myocarditis and pericarditis), haematological (haemolytic anaemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia), neurological (lymphocytic meningitis, meningoencephalitis),\n\n-In immunocompromised patients: lymphoproliferative syndrome\n\n- In predisposed individuals (Purtilo syndrome): monocytomacrophagic activation syndrome\n\n- EBV is also a risk factor for Burkitt's lymphoma\n\n\n'''Differential diagnoses'''\n\n- Other infections\n\n- Bacterial: Scarlet fever (erythematopulmonary angina), exceptional diphtheria (extensive pseudomembranous angina)\n\n           - Viral: CMV (no angina), primary HIV infection (caution with adolescents),\n\n           - Parasitic: toxoplasmosis (cervical adenopathy, sometimes general signs)\n\n- Drug-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (particularly DRESS)\n\n- Lymphoma (polyadenopathies)\n\n- Kawasaki disease",
