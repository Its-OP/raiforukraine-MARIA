A work-up should be discussed on a case-by-case basis; the tests that may be carried out depending on the context are:==\n\n*ultrasonography of the urinary tract with measurement of post-micturition residue\n*urinary flowmetry\n*urodynamic assessment\n*CT urography\n*cystoscopy\n\n*Acute simple pyelonephritis: no imaging test recommended as first-line treatment for a first episode. In the event of a poor clinical course, significant pain or persistent symptoms after 48-72 hours, an imaging test should be carried out: uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound scan.\n*Pyelonephritis at risk of complications: uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound within 24 hours.\n*Severe acute pyelonephritis (acute obstructive pyelonephritis/febrile nephritic colic/purulent retention of the upper urinary tract or pyelonephritis complicated by [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|sepsis or septic shock 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]]): urgent uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound scan.\n\n==Other imaging tests have no place in the initial management :==\n\n*MRI unnecessary except in very special cases\n*Retrograde cystography essential if the context is suggestive of vesico-uretero-renal reflux (classically evoked from the second episode of pyelonephritis, but this figure is indicative).\n*Cystoscopy: to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\n*Cintigraphy:\n**DMSA in order to assess the functional value of each kidney and look for sequelae of renal scarring (in the case of repeated pyelonephritis, a non-functional kidney which is a source of infection may indicate nephrectomy).\n**MAG3 in order to identify an obstacle in the urinary tract (in the case of pyeloureteral junction syndrome, for example).",
