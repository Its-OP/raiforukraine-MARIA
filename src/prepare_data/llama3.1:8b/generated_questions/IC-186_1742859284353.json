The ''diagnosis of respiratory allergy'' is based on the demonstration of a strong association between exposure to an allergen and the onset of symptoms.\n\nThis association is evaluated :\n\n1- by the \"unity of place, time and action\".\n\no \"Per-annual pneumallergens\" (responsible for per-annual symptoms) are most often \"indoor allergens\":\n\n\u00a7 dust mites and cockroaches, animal dander: dogs, cats, rodents; mould.\n\n\u00a7 Certain outdoor moulds such as Alternaria are also involved in allergic phenomena.\n\no \"Seasonal pneumallergens\" are most often \"outdoor allergens\":\n\n\u00a7 pollens from trees, grasses (the most ubiquitous), herbaceous plants,...\n\n\n2- and by \"evidence of sensitisation\" to the allergen (positive skin test/presence of specific IgE antibodies).",
