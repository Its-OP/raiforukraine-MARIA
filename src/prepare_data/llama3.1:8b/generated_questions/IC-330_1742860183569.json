edema\n\n===Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2===\n\n*Immunological reaction between platelet PF4 membrane protein and heparin\n*Precipitation of intravascular platelets\n*Arterial and venous thrombosis (white thrombus disease), sometimes preceded by an injection site reaction or systemic reaction.\n*Typically between J4-J14, but early form possible in case of previous heparin exposure\n*Decrease in platelets >50% or <100 G/L (often >20 G/L)\n*Rare but serious adverse reaction (mortality >10%)\n*Rare disease: UFH (>1%) > LMWH (0.1-1%) > daparanoid (10% cross-reactivity in case of HIT) > fondaparinux (very exceptional)\n*More frequent in surgical situations (including caesarean sections) or in cancer.\n*Risk of thrombosis greater than that of haemorrhage: heparin stopped and another anticoagulant introduced (daparanoid, argotraban).\n*Clinical probability score for HIT: 4T score (thrombocytopenia >20 G/L, timing, thrombosis, other causes of thrombocytopenia).\n\nInjection site reaction\n\nAllergy (pain, erythema, purpura)\n\n==Monitoring methods===\n===Clinical monitoring===\n\n*Tolerance: sign of bleeding, injection site reaction (allergy, local necrosis, pain, etc.).\n*Effectiveness: signs of thrombosis depending on the indication.\n\n===Biological monitoring===\n\n====Platelet monitoring====\n\n*low risk: no platelet monitoring\n*intermediate risk: once or twice a week D4-J14 then once a week for a month\n*high risk: two or three times a week D4-J14 then once a week for a month\n\n{|
