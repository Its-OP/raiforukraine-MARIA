(but climacteric symptoms may be absent).\n\n'''In the typical form, there is no room for biological confirmation of the diagnosis.'''\n\nThe search for ''[[Amenorrhoea|other diagnoses of amenorrhoea]]'' should be taken into account depending on the patient's age (necessary if under 40).\n\n== Special cases ==\nIn the case of \"hysterectomy\", the diagnosis will be based on the conditions of the hysterectomy, the existence of climacteric symptoms and/or the patient's age.\n\nIn the case of \"oestroprogestogenic contraception\" or amenorrhoea induced by certain contraceptives or hormonal treatments, the diagnosis of menopause can be made difficult and biological assays can be used (FSH > 30 IU/ml +estradiol < 10-20 pg/ml). However, these assays can be distorted by the use of hormonal contraception, and there is considerable variability in these assays during the perimenopausal phase.\n\n'''The strategy proposed is most often to stop the treatment in progress and monitor the clinical situation (onset of amenorrhoea)'''.",
