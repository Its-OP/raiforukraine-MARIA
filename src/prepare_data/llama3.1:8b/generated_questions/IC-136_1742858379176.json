    "question": "What is the primary mechanism of action of curares?",
    "option_a": "It blocks the action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle relaxation.",
    "option_b": "It stimulates the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, increasing muscle contraction.",
    "option_c": "It blocks the action of acetylcholine at the central nervous system, leading to sedation and analgesia.",
    "option_d": "It stimulates the release of acetylcholine at the central nervous system, increasing heart rate and blood pressure.",
