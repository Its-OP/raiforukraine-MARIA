Avoid in the treatment of chronic anxiety disorders. Monitor tolerance and risk of marked adverse effects in elderly patients.\n\nBenzodiazepine-like hypnotics (Z drugs) are not indicated for chronic insomnia. Their benefit/risk ratio is low in the elderly population (risk of falls and fractures).\n\nIf taken on a long-term basis, suggest a gradual withdrawal.",
