The aim of treatment is the permanent lowering of uricemia in order to obtain the dissolution of these deposits, the disappearance of clinical signs and the prevention of chronic gout complications.\n\n- the doctor must take the time to inform the patient about :\n\n- the importance of obtaining a target value for uricemia that allows the dissolution of\n\ncrystals;\n\n- the importance of long-term compliance with hypouricemic treatments;\n\n- the risk of a gout attack when taking hypouricemic drugs;\n\n- the cardiovascular, metabolic and renal risk associated with gout ;\n\n- the necessary adjustments to lifestyle, including compliance with dietary and hygiene rules\n\n- screening for and treatment of co-morbidities (cardiovascular, renal, metabolic syndrome)",
