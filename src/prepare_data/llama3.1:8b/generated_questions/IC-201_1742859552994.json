Epidemiological aspects of organ transplantation===\n\n*There is a shortage of organs. Needs far exceed transplant possibilities.\n*There has been an overall increase in the number of registered organ transplant candidates.\n*There has been an overall increase in the number of organ transplants performed.\n\n===B.    Results===\n\n*Transplantation is prolonging and improving the lives of an increasing number of patients with end-stage failure of one or more organs.\n*The results of organ transplantation are expressed as actuarial survival, calculated for the survival of the transplanted organ and the survival of the recipient (Table 1).\n*Actuarial survival varies according to the organs transplanted.\n\nTable 1: Solid organ transplant outcomes (NO: not observable; Source: Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine medical and scientific report for 2018).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Type of transplant'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Graft survival (cessation of function and/or death)'''\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Patient survival'''\n|-\n|'''At 1 year'''\n|'''At 10 years'''\n|'''At 1 year'''\n|'''At 10 years'''\n|-\n|Kidney\n|91,8\n|59,2\n|96.4 <sup>a</sup>\n|73.6<sup>a</sup>\n|-\n|'''Liver'''\n|83,5\n|NO\n|86,6\n|NO\n|-\n|'''Heart'''\n|76,6\n|56,2\n|76,7\n|56,8\n|-\n|Lung Bi\n|79,9\n|NO\n|80,2\n|NO\n|-\n|'''Heart-Lung''''\n|64,7\n|NO\n|65,1\n|39,9\n|-\n| Pancreas-Rein\n|78,3\n|NO\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|}\n<sup>a</sup> Kidney from deceased donor\n\n===C.    Administrative organisation===\nThe administrative organisation of organ transplantation activities is based on the Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine (Biomedicine Agency), which has the following missions:\n\n*Managing the national list of patients awaiting transplantation;\n*co-ordinating organ harvesting and the distribution and allocation of harvested organs;\nevaluating the medical activities of transplantation teams; * managing the National Refusal Register (RNR);\n*managing the National Register of Refusals to Transplant (RNR);\n*promoting transplantation research;\n*promoting organ donation.\n\n\nThe award rules depend on :\n\n*medical criteria (e.g. ABO blood group, HLA compatibility, shortest possible cold ischaemia time);\n*equity criteria (e.g. waiting time);\n*priority criteria that depend on the urgency of the transplant and the difficulty of finding a compatible recipient.",
