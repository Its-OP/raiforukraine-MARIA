It refers to malfunctions in the healthcare system, a failure to provide care or a reduction in the quality of care.\n\nSeveral structural and organisational factors have been identified and are listed in the Migration Sant\u00e9 Alsace publication (Vers plus d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9: guide de pr\u00e9vention et de lutte contre les discriminations, 2019).\n\n1) Asymmetrical power relationships in care. Patients may feel illegitimate, and therefore not ask questions or express their preferences.\n\n2) Heterogeneous practices. Some care teams do not have sufficient conditions to reflect on the malfunctions that can lead to discrimination.\n\n3) Territorial inequalities in healthcare provision. In a situation of desertification or shortage of healthcare provision, refusal of care is not distributed equitably.\n\n4) Lack of co-ordination, which explains why some carers refuse to treat certain patients deemed more difficult to treat.\n\n5) Insufficient use of professional interpreters, despite the difficulty of providing care in the absence of a common language.\n\n6) Economic logic in tension with care objectives: the race for profitability can reinforce the differential orientation of patients, and the fact that patients who are thought to be more complicated are treated less well.\n\nhttps://www.migrationssante.org/axes-dintervention/discriminations-et-sante/guide/<br />",
