It is important to point out to patients that lower values do not necessarily mean infertility or sterility.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Parameters'''\n|'''Standards'''\n|'''Anomalies'''\n|-\n|Sperm volume\n|N \u2265 1.4 mL\n|Absence of ejaculate: aspermia\n\n\u2193: Hypospermia\n|-\n|pH of sperm\n|7,2 \u2264 N \u2264 8\n|\u2193: Acid semen\n\n\u2191: Alkaline sperm\n|-\n|Numeration\n|N \u2265 16 million/mL (concentration)\n\n\nN \u2265 39 million/ejac\n|\u2193 : Oligozoospermia\n\nAbsence of spz = Azoospermia\n|-\n|Mobility\n\nat 1 hour\n|total (PR+NP) \u2265 42%\n\nprogressive (PR) \u2265 30%\n|\u2193: Asthenozoospermia\n|-\n|Vitality\n|N \u2265 58%\n|\u2193: Necrozoospermia\n|-\n|Morphology\n|Typical Spz \u2265 4% (according to Kr\u00fcger classification)\n\nTypical Spz \u2265 23% (according to modified David classification)\n|\u2193 : Teratozoospermia\n|-\n|Leukocytes\n|N < 1 million/mL\n|\u2191 Leukospermia\n|}",
