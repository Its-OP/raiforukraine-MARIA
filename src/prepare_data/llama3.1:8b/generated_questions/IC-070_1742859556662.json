Disorganisation and negative symptoms less frequent.\n\n== Alcohol use disorder ==\nAddiction criteria for young adults are not adapted to the elderly in terms of occupational repercussions or tolerance. In old age, attention should be paid to functional repercussions, bodily neglect and sleep disorders. Anxiety, depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment may occur. Be vigilant for confusional syndromes or physical signs of withdrawal during hospitalisation.\n\n== '''Medication use disorder''' ==\nMedication use disorder is not specific, but there is a greater risk of iatrogenicity.",
