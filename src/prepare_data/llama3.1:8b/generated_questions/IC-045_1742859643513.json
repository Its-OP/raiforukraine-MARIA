Medical complications need to be treated early and rehabilitation needs to be started quickly. Rehabilitation can take place in the private sector or in a CAMSP (Centre d'action m\u00e9dico-sociale pr\u00e9coce for 0-6 year olds) then SESSAD (Service d'\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale et de soins \u00e0 domicile, up to the age of 20).\n\nThroughout life, it is important to know how to look for the main complications (see [[Evolution of trisomy 21|2C-045-SP-A01]]) and to treat them in order to avoid, in particular, over-handicap (vision problems, hypoacusis, hypothyroidism).\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 have a margin of progression, which varies from one patient to another and is impossible to predict. They have a psychomotor delay ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|anomaly of psychomotor development]]). For example, walking is acquired on average between 2 and 3 years of age, compared with between 9 and 18 months for a child without Down's syndrome. Language acquisition is often the most delayed, accompanied by speech disorders ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]).\n\nPuberty proceeds normally.\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 are often short (over - 2 DS) ([[Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]) and have a tendency to develop obesity which should be treated by hygienic and dietary measures and by encouraging the practice of sport.\n\nThe majority of children with Down's syndrome are able to recognise words, and even to read, write a few words and count a little, allowing them a degree of independence.\n\nInclusion in the mainstream environment should be encouraged as far as possible, either in normal classes or in adapted classes (ULIS: Unit\u00e9s Localis\u00e9es pour l'Inclusion Scolaire). If the child has reached his or her limits in terms of acquiring school skills, he or she may be admitted to an IME (Institut m\u00e9dico-\u00e9ducatif) or an IMPro (Institut m\u00e9dico-professionnel) to work on independence and learn a trade.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome can be housed (rare). They can work in a mainstream workplace (rare), work in an ESAT (\u00c9tablissement et service d'aide par le travail, the majority), stay with their parents or move into a so-called occupational home.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome usually have an emotional life and some women (rare) have children.\n\nIn adulthood, the question arises of guardianship, curatorship or family administrative supervision to protect these people, particularly financially.\n\nFrom their fifties onwards, people with Down's syndrome begin to experience the complications associated with premature ageing and an increased risk of dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer's type ([[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|memory impairment/cognitive decline]]).\n\nLife expectancy is estimated at 60 years.",
