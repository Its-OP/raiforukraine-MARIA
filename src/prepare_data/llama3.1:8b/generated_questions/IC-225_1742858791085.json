This condition is uncommon. It is indicative of advanced and diffuse atheromatous disease.\n\n*Functional signs: This is a triad associating :\n**Post prandial abdominal pain ('''''SD-004: abdominal pain'''''): This corresponds to claudication of the small intestine (mesenteric angina). It is the earliest and most constant symptom, and consists of intense cramp-like pain. It most often occurs in the periumbilical region. It begins around 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and slowly subsides over one to two hours. Its severity and duration are correlated with the quantity, calorie and fat content of the meal and the degree of malperfusion. In the early stages, only large meals trigger the pain, then as the lesions progress, the pain becomes more frequent after ingestion of a modest volume of food;\n**Eviction and food splitting: these post-prandial pains lead patients to reduce their food intake for fear of post-prandial pain.  Severe malnutrition may set in;\n**Emaciation: this is often significant and results from malnutrition.\n\nOther symptoms may be associated but are less typical: diarrhoea, vomiting.\n\n*Physical signs:\n**An abdominal murmur is inconstantly present. Clinical examination may reveal the presence of other atheromatous sites (carotid or femoral murmurs, abolition of peripheral pulses).\n\n'''Acute intestinal ischaemia'''\n\nIt is defined as the acute interruption of digestive vascularisation, in relation to acute arterial occlusion by embolism, thrombosis or dissection. It is an absolute and vital therapeutic emergency.\n\nEarly diagnosis is essential at the stage of reversible intestinal ischaemia. Acute abdominal pain occurring in a patient at risk (>60 years old, atheromatous, emboligic heart disease) should systematically raise this diagnosis, given its seriousness.\n\nThe spontaneous prognosis is extremely poor in the absence of treatment, rapidly leading to death. If blood flow is restored, the prognosis remains poor and depends on the extent of intestinal necrosis.\n\n*Functional signs\n**Abdominal pain is the most constant sign. It is a sudden and intense cramp-like pain, located in the umbilical region and in the right iliac fossa. The intensity of the pain contrasts with a poor physical examination and an initially stable general condition. In the early stages, there is often hyperperistalsis, which may manifest as diarrhoea.\n\nWithin a few hours, an intestinal obstruction develops (vomiting, defensiveness). General signs are present, with fever, progressive shock and multiple organ failure. These signs indicate the existence of an irreversible infarct.\n\n*Physical signs: A distinction can be made between :\n**A reversible acute mesenteric ischaemic syndrome characterised by very severe pain and the absence of peritoneal signs;\n**A picture of intestinal mesenteric infarction, characterised by severe permanent pain with peritoneal signs (abdominal contracture), an occlusive state and then a state of shock.",
