Conservative treatment = salpingotomy or removal of the tube = salpingectomy.\n\n'''Pauci or asymptomatic EP'''\n\nIn this case, treatment with methotrexate can be discussed with the patient: an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> in the absence of contraindication on the biological work-up (CBC, PT/ACT, renal and hepatic work-up).\n\nMonitoring includes questioning about clinical symptoms and weekly monitoring of plasma \u03b2-hCG levels. A clinical examination and ultrasound scan may be carried out at any time in the event of functional signs suggesting a haemorrhagic complication of the EP. A 2nd<sup>injection</sup> of MTX should be considered if the decrease in the plasma \u03b2-hCG level at D7 is not satisfactory compared with the initial level (in practice, the \u03b2-hCG level at D7 should be strictly lower than the level at D0 or strictly lower than 85% of the \u03b2-hCG level at D4 if this is available). Cure corresponds to an undetectable plasma \u03b2-hCG level. This is generally achieved after one month.\n\nSpecial cases: In certain exceptional cases, if the patient is asymptomatic, if the initial \u03b2-hCG level is less than 1,000 IU/L and if the kinetics of \u03b2-hCG show a progressive and constant decrease, it may be possible to discuss abstention from treatment subject to good compliance by the patient (\u03b2-hCG measurement every 48 hours and clinical and ultrasound monitoring once a week). The patient must be informed of the risk of failure.\n\nRemember to check the patient's blood group to prevent anti-D alloimmunisation if necessary.",
