However, it is important to offer genetic counselling to the patient's family, as there is a high risk of genetic instability that could lead to the appearance of a complete mutation in other children ([[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family]], [[Disability situation SD-345|disability situation]]).\n\nA family history of ovarian failure (reproductive difficulty SD-033|productive difficulty), menstrual cycle disorder SD-094|menstrual cycle disorder) or adult neurodegenerative syndrome is an argument in favour of fragile X syndrome.",
