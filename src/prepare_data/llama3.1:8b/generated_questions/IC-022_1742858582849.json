They should be aware of the main facilities available to help them obtain information and ensure multidisciplinary management of the patient: centres of reference and competence for rare diseases, health networks, Orphanet, Maladies rares Info Services, rare disease expertise platforms in the territories ('''[[Situation of disability SD-345|situation of disability]], [[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|announcement of a chronic disease]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious disease to the patient and/or his/her family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious disease to the patient and/or his/her family]'')''). Patients must be informed of the existence of specific patient associations, or of Alliance Maladies Rares, which will direct them to the most appropriate association. The rare disability relay teams (ERHR) complete the medico-social system for particularly complex disability situations. National protocols for diagnosis and care (PNDS) for all the main rare diseases are published on the HAS website and include a summary for the attending physician: Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 - Protocoles nationaux de diagnostic et de soins (PNDS) (https://www.has-sante.fr)",
