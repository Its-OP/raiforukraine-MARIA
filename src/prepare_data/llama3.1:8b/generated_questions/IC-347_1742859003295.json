Hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.\n\n*<u>'''[[2C-260|Hematuria 260]]'''</u>: In the event of haematuria associated with acute retention of urine, bladder catheterisation with bladder washes (dual stream catheter) will be required.\n\n*<u>'''[[2C-258|Acute renal failure 258]]'''</u>: Endovesical hyperpressure due to acute retention of urine can lead to dilatation of the pyelocaval cavities which can induce acute renal failure. Late-onset clinical signs include nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, diarrhoea and headache.\n\n==Complications secondary to acute urinary retention===\nComplications secondary to acute retention of urine are :\n\n*<Vacuo haematuria: This is caused by the rupture of submucosal veins when the bladder is emptied too quickly. It is advisable to empty the bladder gradually and to clamp the bladder catheter every 500 ml.\n\n*<Obstruction lifting syndrome: Transient polyuria with risk of dehydration due to water overload and tubulopathy with inability to concentrate urine. Screening is based on hourly monitoring of diuresis. Treatment is based on intravenous water compensation.\n\n*<Bladder rupture and rarely bladder rupture </u>.",
