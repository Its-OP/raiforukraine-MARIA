The paralysis is then directly caused by the intracranial hypertension, without any localising value. On the other hand, any other oculomotor paralysis indicates a lesion in the nuclei or nerve tracts concerned.",

    "question": "In the case of VI paralysis caused by intracranial hypertonia, what can be said about its localising value?",
    "option_a": "It has a high localising value, indicating a lesion in the nuclei or nerve tracts concerned",
    "option_b": "It has a moderate localising value, suggesting a possible lesion in the brainstem but not in the nuclei or nerve tracts",
    "option_c": "It has a low localising value, indicating that the paralysis is directly caused by intracranial hypertension without any indication of a lesion in the nuclei or nerve tracts",
    "option_d": "It has no localising value at all, making it impossible to determine the cause of the paralysis",
