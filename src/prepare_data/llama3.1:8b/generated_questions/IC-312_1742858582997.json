In situ\" cancers (ductal or lobular) are therefore characterised by their lack of metastatic potential.\n* When the carcinoma becomes invasive (= crosses the basement membrane), the cells can spread either by lymphatic or haematogenous route or by contiguity.\n* Lymphatic drainage of the breast takes place at three main sites: the lymph nodes of the axillary fossa (the most important), the supra- and sub-clavicular nodes and the nodes of the internal mammary chain. These different areas can therefore be affected by the disease.",

    "question": "What is a characteristic of in situ cancers (carcinomas) of the breast?",
    "option_a": "They have a high metastatic potential and can spread to distant organs",
    "option_b": "They arise from the cells of the breast's secretory apparatus, consisting of the lobules and milk ducts",
    "option_c": "They are characterized by their ability to cross the basement membrane and spread through the lymphatic or haematogenous route",
    "option_d": "They are located within the epithelial layer, without crossing the basement membrane",
