Contralateral orchidopexy may be performed at the same time or at a later date. If the testicle is not viable, orchiectomy is necessary.\n\n*No further investigations should delay surgical management.\n*The patient and his family must be warned of the risk of orchiectomy and sequelae of testicular atrophy if the testicle has been preserved.\n\n==''Necrotizing fasciitis:'''==\n\n*The treatment of necrotising fasciitis of the external genitalia is multidisciplinary, based on the following management options:\n**medical: in an intensive care unit with antibiotic therapy combining C3G and an aminoglycoside combined with an anti-anaerobic antibiotic.\n**Surgical: under general anaesthetic as an emergency measure, with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue without any closure A urinary or digestive diversion may be necessary.\n**hyperbaric oxygen therapy.",
