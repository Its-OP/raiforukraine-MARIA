The overall prevalence of the syndrome varies widely, ranging from 10% to 70% of post-menopausal women.\n\nThe diagnosis of MGS is mainly clinical; a single symptom being sufficient to describe this syndrome.\n<br />\n\n== Medium and long-term effects\n\n=== Postmenopausal osteoporosis ===\n\n==== Definition ====\nOsteoporosis is defined as a state of diffuse skeletal fragility linked to a reduction in mineral mass and alterations in bone microarchitecture, which may be complicated by fractures following minor trauma.\n\nThe most typical fractures are wrist fractures, vertebral compression and femoral neck fractures.\n\n==== Tissue consequences of the menopause ====\nEstrogen deficiency causes osteoclastic hyperactivity, leading to accelerated bone loss.\n\nThe risk of osteoporosis will depend on the woman's bone stock at the time of her menopause and the rate of post-menopausal bone loss.\n\n==== Screening women at risk ====\n- Measurement of bone capital at 2 reference sites (lumbar spine and upper end of femur) by ''osteodensitometry'' using the reference technique d''''absorptiometry biphotonique \u00e0 rayons X'' (DEXA)\n\nAny subject will be considered osteoporotic when his or her bone mineral density value is less than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for young adults (T-score < -2.5)''.\n\n- Other fracture risk factors, study of bone remodelling (markers).\n\n=== Cardiovascular disease ===\nEpidemiological data have clearly established that the onset of the menopause, whether natural or surgical, is associated with a loss of the advantage that women have over men with regard to cardiovascular disease. The disturbances underlying this risk are :\n\n    - metabolic disturbances affecting lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, insulin metabolism, fat mass distribution and haemostasis disturbances (table 5).\n\n   - ''direct alterations in the structure and reactivity of the vascular wall'', with estrogen deficiency reducing arterial vasoreactivity and promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.\n\n==== Screening women at risk ====\nIn practice, ''screening for cardiovascular risk'' is still based on the search for traditional risk factors, with the menopause constituting an additional risk factor. A number of so-called emerging risk factors specific to women also contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in women after the menopause (gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, migraines with aura, etc.).",
