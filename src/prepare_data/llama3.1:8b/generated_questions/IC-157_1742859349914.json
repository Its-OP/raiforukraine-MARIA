    "option_a": "Monitor the patient's vital signs and wait for 3-5 days to see if the fever resolves",
    "option_b": "Immediately switch to a different antibiotic regimen and check for complications such as healthcare-associated infections",
    "option_c": "Check the progress of the infection by controlling the portal of entry, treating secondary sites, and draining abscesses or empyema, and also verify that antibiotic therapy is appropriate",
