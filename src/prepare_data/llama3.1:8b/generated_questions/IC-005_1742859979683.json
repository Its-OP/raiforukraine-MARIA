This accident results in abnormal damage with regard to the foreseeable evolution of the state of health. It may have occurred in any healthcare setting: a public or private healthcare establishment, the practice of a self-employed healthcare professional, a medical analysis or radiology laboratory, a pharmacy, etc. A medical accident may be caused by an error on the part of a healthcare professional, or it may be the result of care provided in accordance with good practice, in which case it is known as a \"therapeutic hazard\".\n\nIatrogenic conditions refer to all the harmful effects that can be caused by a treatment or medical procedure. Iatrogenic effects occur when the treatment triggers new symptoms, distinct from those it was intended to treat. The iatrogenic effect may occur with or without misuse of the drug, whether this misuse is the fault of a healthcare professional or the patient him/herself. Iatrogenic disorders should therefore not be confused with medical errors. An iatrogenic condition is a consequence of taking a medicine, even if the indication was correct and the dosage correct. It is therefore possible to be the victim of an iatrogenic condition without any error or fault on the part of the healthcare professional.",
