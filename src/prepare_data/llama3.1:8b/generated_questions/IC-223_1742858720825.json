It has been clearly demonstrated that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels leads to a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular accidents.\n\n* The link between hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis appears likely, particularly if associated with low HDL-cholesterol (in the context of metabolic syndrome). However, the level of evidence is not as high as for LDL-cholesterol.",
