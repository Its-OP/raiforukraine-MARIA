The rash may be accompanied by a low-grade fever.\n[[File:Megalerythema.jpg|neant|thumb]]\n\n\nOther eruptive forms include \"socks and gloves\" syndrome, erythema multiforme or, more rarely, livedo or erythema nodosum.\n\nJoint involvement such as arthralgia or arthritis may accompany the rash, and is more common in adults.\n\n\n'''Complications/ Risks for pregnant women'''\n\nInfection of erythrobastic precursors by the virus can lead to haematological complications in the foetus (hydrops, death in utero) and in children with underlying red cell disease (aggravated chronic haemolytic anaemia with erythroblastopenia).",
