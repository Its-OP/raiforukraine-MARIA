Severe PAG corresponds to a PAG below the 3rd percentile.\n\nIUGR (Fetal Growth Restriction - FGR - or Intra-Uterine Growth Retardation - IUGR) most often corresponds to a PAG associated with arguments in favour of a pathological growth defect (abnormality of the staturo-ponderal [[normal growth of the child 2C-053-DE-A01|growth]]): stoppage or inflection of growth longitudinally (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).\n\n'''Main risk factors:''''\n\n''-'' Maternal background / obstetrical history '':'' age < 20 years or > 35 years, '''Malnutrition/Denutrition''', low socio-economic level ('''precarious social situation and isolation''), smoking ('''prevention of tobacco-related risks''), alcoholism, drug addiction, uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids (''Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging''), history of pregnancy complicated by IUGR, low weight gain during pregnancy, placental haemangioma, velamentous cord insertion;\n\n''-'' Foetal pathologies: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). These IUGRs are early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and often associated with morphological anomalies or hydramnios (increased amniotic fluid);\n\n''-'' Vascular pathologies '':'' preeclampsia ('''[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]]''' and/or '''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]]''' and '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''), chronic maternal pathologies : '''Chronic arterial hypertension''', nephropathy ('''increased creatinine'''), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications ('''prevention of cardiovascular disease'''). IUGR of vascular origin is most often late (onset in the 3rd trimester), but can be early in severe forms. These IUGRs tend to recur in subsequent pregnancies.\n\n'''Possible complications in children:'''\n\n- Perinatal asphyxia ;\n\n- Hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia;\n\n- Polycythaemia secondary to chronic foetal hypoxia ;\n\n- In the case of associated prematurity, increased mortality and risk of respiratory and digestive complications;\n\nLonger term :\n\n- Neurodevelopmental abnormalities ;\n\n- Growth retardation ;\n\n- Metabolic syndrome in adults\n\n'''Neonatal bacterial infections (NBI)'''\n\nRefer to the 2017 good practice recommendations: Management of the newborn at risk of early bacterial neonatal infection (\u2265 34 SA).\n\nINBP risk factors\n\n1) Maternal colonisation with SGB\n\n2) History of neonatal GBS infection\n\n3) Maternal fever > 38.0\u00b0C intrapartum or within 2 hours of delivery\n\n4) Membrane rupture > 12h\n\n5) Spontaneous and unexplained prematurity < 37 SA\n\n6) Antibiotic prophylaxis or inadequate per-partum antibiotic therapy (recommended for situations 1 to 3 regardless of the result of the vaginal swab and in situations 4 and 5 in the case of a positive or unknown vaginal swab).\n\n'''Identify newborns presenting symptoms of BIN'' (non-specific but should raise the possibility of BIN if present in the first 48 hours) '''([[Examination of the term newborn SD-039|Examination of the term newborn]])''' :\n\n* General signs: fever (temperature \u2265 38.0\u00b0C) or hypothermia (temperature < 36.0\u00b0C) '''(Hyperthermia/[[Acute fever in children and adults|fever]], [[Hypothermia SD-045|Hypothermia]])''' ;\n* Respiratory signs: respiratory distress (signs of struggle), tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 60/min), apnoea (acute respiratory distress);\n* Haemodynamic signs: tachycardia (> 160 bpm) or bradycardia (< 80 bpm), signs of shock (increased skin recolouration time, pallor, arterial hypotension, oliguria) \u2192 signs of severity '''(Tachycardia, [[Child pallor SD-055|pallor]] of the child)'''' ;\n* Neurological signs: somnolence, irritability, hypotonia, convulsions \u2192 signs of seriousness, must suggest neonatal meningitis '''(Coma and consciousness disorders, [[Hypotonia/infant malaise SD-046|Hypotonia]] / [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SD-050|malaise]] of the infant, [[Convulsions SD-120|Convulsions]])''' ;\n* Digestive signs: refusal to drink, vomiting.\n\n\n'''Complications''' '''possible in children''': variable depending on the bacteria responsible for INBP and the severity of the infection (septic shock, meningitis)\n\n'''Respiratory distress'''\n\n'''Main risk factors:''''\n\n* Prematurity;\n* Risk factors for early neonatal bacterial infection;\n* Diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes;\n* Caesarean section before labour;\n* Meconium amniotic fluid;\n* Perinatal anoxo-ischaemia.\n\n'''Clinical diagnosis''' '''([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Respiratory distress]] acute, [[Term newborn examination SD-039|Term newborn examination]])''': presence of one or more of the following symptoms:\n\n- polypnoea: FR > 60/min ;\n\n- signs of respiratory struggle: flapping of the wings of the nose, thoraco-abdominal rocking, intercostal draught, xyphoid funnel, expiratory whimpering ;\n\n- cyanosis and/or low oxygen saturation '''(Colour abnormalities of the extremities)''''\n\n'''Signs of seriousness''' :\n\n- intensity of respiratory distress: Silverman score ;\n\n- pauses in breathing ;\n\n- associated haemodynamic disorders.\n\n'''Complications''' '''possible in children''': mainly related to the cause of respiratory distress\n\n'''Maternal pathologies: diabetes during pregnancy'''\n\n'''Complications''' '''in children specific to type 1 or 2 diabetes prior to pregnancy:''''\n\n* congenital malformations (especially of the central nervous system, heart and skeleton)\n\n'''Complications in children common to all types of diabetes (type 1, type 2, gestational):''''\n\n* foetal death in utero ;\n* prematurity\n* macrosomia and obstetric complications (shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury, fracture, perinatal asphyxia): mainly related to glycaemic imbalance in the 3rd<sup> trimester of pregnancy;\n* metabolic: hypoglycaemia (due to hyperinsulinism), hypocalcaemia, polycythemia, jaundice;\n* respiratory distress (in particular hyaline membrane disease) '''(Acute respiratory distress)''' ;\n* hypertrophic cardiomyopathy possible.\n\nLonger term :\n\n* Metabolic risks: obesity, glucose intolerance, etc.\n* Maternal pathologies: infections\n\nRefer to item 27 Prevention of foetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation.\n\nMain infections at risk for the foetus and/or the newborn:\n\n* Bacterial: syphilis, listeriosis, bacteria responsible for INBP (mainly Streptococcus B, E.

Postnatal effects less well described.\n\n- Cannabis: spontaneous miscarriage, placenta previa, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation. Frequent use of cannabis and tobacco together\n\nIt is important to detect such use, to offer the woman treatment and addictological follow-up with a view to weaning her off the drug or at least reducing her consumption, to monitor the newborn baby in the light of the risks mentioned above, and to assess the social and family situation and provide treatment on a case-by-case basis (precarious social situation and isolation, suspected abuse and children at risk).\n\nMaternal psychiatric disorders\n\nRefer to item 69 - Pregnancy and post-partum psychological disorders for psychological pathologies specific to pregnancy.\n\nWhatever the mother's psychological pathology, the child's care is based on :\n\n* Specific neonatal monitoring according to maternal treatments taken during pregnancy;\n* Assessment of the family situation (state of health of both parents, family environment);\n* Case-by-case care after the birth (support measures, parenting support, proposals for day-care facilities or mother-baby hospitalisation, drafting of a report of concern/reporting to the cellule de recueil des informations pr\u00e9occupantes and possible separation of mother and child in the event of possible danger to the child). <br />",
