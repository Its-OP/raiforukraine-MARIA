It is linked to impaired insulin secretion capacity (relative insulinopenia) and insulin resistance.  \n\nHyperglycaemia itself (glucotoxicity), lipotoxicity and the presence of chronic low-grade inflammation all contribute to impaired insulin secretion.\n\nSeveral factors are involved in the impairment of insulin secretion capacity, including genetic predisposition.\n\nInsulin resistance is favoured by environmental factors, including a sedentary lifestyle and overeating.\n\nThe presence of metabolic syndrome and android obesity increases the cardiovascular risk of people with type 2 diabetes.",
