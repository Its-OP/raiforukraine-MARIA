([[Heparins]] and [[Oral anticoagulants (VKAs and OADs)]]).\n\n''''' Choice of anticoagulant treatment and available treatment regimens'''''\n\n*Direct oral anticoagulants (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban)''''\n**Recommended as first-line treatment except for high-risk or high-intermediate PE.\n**prescribed immediately (without heparin phase).  \n**Main contraindications: severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min according to Cockcroft), pregnancy, breast-feeding, drug interactions (Cyt 3A4 or PgP).\n**May be used in certain cancer patients.\n*''Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) / fondaparinux - VKA relay.'''\n**Not recommended as a first-line strategy, but offered if contraindication to VKAs.\n**VKA treatment is started on the first day of treatment.\n**Parenteral treatment (LMWH / fondaparinux) is prescribed at a curative dose for at least 5 days (no monitoring) and then discontinued once 2 INR > 2 have been achieved at least 24 hours apart.\n*Unfractionated heparin (UFH)\n**reserved for severe PE and the treatment of MVTE in patients with renal insufficiency and a urine clearance of less than 15 mL/min.\n**initial dose of 80 IU/kg\n**initial dose of UFH is 18 IU/kg/hour\n**daily monitoring of anti-Xa activity (ideally) and at each dose change (target 0.3 - 0.6 U/ml).\n**Platelet count monitored twice weekly for the first 2 weeks of treatment.\n**VKA relay must be carried out according to the same procedures as for LMWH/Fondaparinux.\n**The relay may also be taken with an AOD.\n*LMWH without VKA relay. This regimen is proposed for\n**patients with cancer, particularly digestive cancer or certain urogenital cancers\n**patients with a high risk of haemorrhage\n**pregnant women:\n***Only heparins, in practice LMWH, may be used throughout pregnancy.\n***If VTE occurs during pregnancy, a minimum of 3 months' anticoagulant treatment is required, including the first 6 weeks post-partum (a period of high thrombotic risk).\n***If breast-feeding, LMWH or warfarin may be used.\n***AODs are contraindicated. Fondaparinux is not recommended.",
