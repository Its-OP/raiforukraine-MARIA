This is because the adrenal cortex is not atrophied and will be able to respond to a high dose of exogenous ACTH during the test. (example: acquired corticotropic insufficiency following surgery for a pituitary adenoma, when the corticotropic axis was normal pre-operatively).\n**Two other stimulation tests can be carried out but in a hospital setting: insulin hypoglycaemia or the Metopirone test.\n\nIf the pre-test cortisol is <5 ng/ml (138 nmol/l), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made without the need for a synACTHene stimulation test.\n\nOutside a situation of major physical stress, if cortisol is >500 nmol/l, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ruled out and the stimulation test is not necessary.\n\n<br />",
