It therefore depends on the other reference treatments available.\n\nBased on this assessment, five levels of ASMR have been defined to help determine the price of the drug:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Therapeutic progress\n!ASMR\nImpact on the price of the drug\n|-\n|Major\n|ASMR I\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Possibility of a price higher than that of comparators\n|-\n|Important\n|ASMR II\n|-\n|Moderate\n|ASMR III\n|-\n|Minor\n|ASMR IV\n|-\n|Absent\n|ASMR V\n|May only be reimbursed if it results in a saving in treatment costs\n|}",
