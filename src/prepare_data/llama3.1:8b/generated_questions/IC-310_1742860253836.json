The inheritance may also be monogenic (approximately 5% of cases). A history of breast or ovarian cancer should also be sought to justify a possible oncogenetic consultation (BRCA mutation).\n*Ethnic origin, particularly African ancestry, increases the risk of prostate cancer. Conversely, prostate cancer is less common in the Asian population.\n*Environmental factors, such as pesticides and endocrine disruptors (e.g. chlordecone pollution in the West Indies is recognised as a possible risk factor for prostate cancer; occupational exposure to chlordecone was recognised as an occupational disease in 2021).\n*Metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (AFU 2022-2024 Cancer Committee recommendations).\n\n<There is no chemoprevention method for prostate cancer.",
