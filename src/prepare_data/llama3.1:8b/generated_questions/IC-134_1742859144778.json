Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n'''Knowledge of pain assessment tools and scales for communicating and non-communicating adults'''\n\n'''General principles'''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several sites of pain, each site should be assessed separately.\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (French version: questionnaire douleur de Saint Antoine), which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|-\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\nThis generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient, there is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).\n\n <gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:EVA adults.png\n</gallery>\n\n*Adult EVA\n\n<br /><gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Eva vertical.png\n</gallery>\n\n*\n\n Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less co-operative patients (asthenia, fatigability).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| No\n         pain\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|10\n|Pain\nmaximum\n|}\n'''The Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (or categorical scale)'''\n\nAimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones.\n\nIncludes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question \"are you in pain\"?\n|}\n'''Pain hetero-assessment scales''''\n\n- They are aimed at patients with ''verbal communication disorders''.\n\n- They require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behaviour and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioural scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently used in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, interruption of movement, etc.\n\nusual activities.\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds imply that clinicians should consider the search for the cause of the pain and its treatment.\n\n<br />",
