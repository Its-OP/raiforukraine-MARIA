There are 3 different situations in the case of :\n**Extracellular dehydration: lack of NaCl intake, digestive, cutaneous or renal loss of NaCl.\n**Isolated intracellular hyperhydration: SIADH or potomania.\n**Global hyperhydration: this is usually due to heart failure, cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, all of which are responsible for volo-dependent stimulation of ADH by effective hypovolaemia. It may also be advanced renal failure.\n\n'''Table 8: SIADH diagnostic criteria'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- Posm < 275 mOsm/kg\n\n- Uosm > 100 mOsm/kg (in hyponatremic conditions)\n\n- Clinical euvolaemia\n\n- UNa > 30 mmol/L (with normal sodium and water intake)\n\n- No hypothyroidism\n\n- No adrenal insufficiency\n\n- Normal renal function and absence of recent diuretic treatment\n\n- Uricemia < 240 \u03bcmol/L\n|}\n\n\n'''Table 9: Etiologies of inappropriate ADH secretion''''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|''Inappropriate hypothalamic secretion of ADH'''\n|-\n|- Central nervous system disorders :\n\n- Infectious: meningitis, meningoencephalitis, abscesses\n\n- Ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes\n\n- Polyradiculoneuritis\n\n- Head trauma\n|-\n|- Lung conditions :\n\n- Bacterial and viral pneumonia\n\n- Acute respiratory failure\n\n- Tuberculosis, cancer, asthma...\n\n- Assisted ventilation with PEEP\n|-\n|- Post-operative period.\n|-\n|- Significant nausea syndromes\n|-\n|- Medications (frequency ++):\n\n- Carbamazepine\n\n- Psychotropic drugs: haloperidol, phenothiazines, IRS-type antidepressants (fluoxetine ++)\n\ntricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, drugs (amphetamines or ecstasy)\n\n- Emetogenic drugs: cyclophosphamide, vincristine, vinblastine, etc.\n|-\n|'''Ectopic tumour secretion of ADH (or ADH-like substance)'''\n|-\n|<nowiki>- Bronchial carcinomas</nowiki>\n\n- Prostate and digestive cancers, lymphomas...\n|-\n|Endocrinopathies\n|-\n|<Hypothyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency</nowiki>.\n\n- Prolactin adenoma\n|-\n|''Potentiation of the effect of ADH by certain drugs'''\n|-\n|<hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (chlorpropamide)</nowiki>\n\n- Theophylline\n\n- Clofibrate\n|-\n|'''Exogenous intake of DHA or DHA analogues (DDAVP, oxytocin)''''\n|}",
