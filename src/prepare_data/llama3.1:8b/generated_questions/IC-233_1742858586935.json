Trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is mainly used to assess mitral valve disease and in cases of suspected endocarditis.\n*The purpose of echocardiography is to \"confirm the diagnosis\", assess the \"severity\" of the valve disease, determine its \"aetiology\", assess its \"impact\" and look for \"other valve diseases\".\n*The main abnormalities are summarised in the table below:\n\n<br />[[File:Ultrasound valvulopathy.png|centred|vignette|alt=|900x900px|Characteristics of valvulopathy on ultrasound]]<br />\n[[File:Mitral insufficiency.png|centre|vignette|900x900px|ETO with posterior mitral valve prolapse (arrow) and eccentric regurgitant flow (Carpentier type II organic MI)]]\n\n\n[[File:Figure 3.png|alt=ETT with MI by ring dilatation + leaflet tenting and central regurgitant flow (type I+III MI) |centre|vignette|900x900px|ETT with MI by ring dilatation + leaflet tenting and central regurgitant flow (type I+III MI)]]\n[[File:Aortic insufficiency.png|alt=ETT with massive IA (regurgitant flow in the LV) in colour and continuous doppler|centre|vignette|900x900px|ETT with tight RA: calcified aortic valve with limited opening (A) and high gradient in continuous doppler (B)]]\n[[File:Figure IA.png|centred|thumb|900x900px|ETT with massive IA (regurgitant flow in the LV) in colour and continuous Doppler]]\n[[File:Figure 5.png|centred|vignette|900x900px|ET0 with tight MR: calcified remodeled mitral and high gradient in continuous Doppler (A) with limited aperture and area <1.5cm<sup>2</sup> in 2D (B) and 3D (C)]]]\n\n\n\n<br />",
