It therefore requires recourse to medically assisted procreation. It enables couples at high risk of transmitting a genetic disease to avoid the ordeal of prenatal diagnosis (Preimplantation Diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>) and possible termination of pregnancy. PGD allows only embryos free of the genetic disease present in the family to be transferred. In France, the practice of PGD is highly regulated. It is only authorised in exceptional cases, when a couple has a high probability of giving birth to a child suffering from a particularly serious genetic disease recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis [[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\nEthical issues. The ethical debate primarily concerns possible developments in this activity. Although the initial indications for PGD were those of prenatal diagnosis, they have since evolved considerably. A wide variety of PGD applications have developed. The most controversial practices are (1) HLA typing of embryos for haematological disorders and (2) determination of embryonic sex for personal convenience ('social sexing').\n\n(1) The possibility of selecting embryos so that they are immunologically compatible with a sick brother or sister requiring a marrow transplant is being sought so that the child, once born, can be a potential cord blood donor. This possibility opened up by PGD brings us back to the concept of the \"medicine baby\" (or \"donor baby\", or \"double hope baby\"), and with it the debate on the possible instrumentalisation of procreation. In France, HLA typing of embryos for hereditary diseases is authorised. However, when there is no risk of hereditary disease, HLA typing is prohibited. The CCNE's position was clear: \"The primary justification for PGD is the birth of a child free from a serious genetic disorder that threatens him or her. The search for immunological compatibility with a sick elder child must always come second\". The absence of any direct benefit for the embryo therefore prohibits recourse to this type of procedure. However, this application is being developed in other countries in cases where a first-born child with cancer could benefit from a compatible cord blood cell transplant. In these countries, the absence of regulations authorises these practices, becoming a source of medical nomadism.\n\n(2) The ethical debate on sex diagnosis for convenience pits supporters of the absolute freedom to have children as one wishes, with whom one wishes, when one wishes, of the sex one wishes, as an inalienable expression of Freedom, against defenders of gender equality as an equally inalienable expression of the principle of Gender Equality. Supporters of social sexing argue that choosing a child's sex is not contrary to the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice ('principalism'). They point out that this practice does not entail any societal risks or eugenics, but does help to balance the sexes in a family. Opponents of sex selection point to the potential harm to the child, the risk of eugenics and gender standardisation.\n\n[Pre-implantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] Prenatal diagnosis (PND) refers to medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus \"in utero\".\n\n[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2anc|2] Chromosomal abnormality, risk of aneuploidy, autosomal recessive diseases (including cystic fibrosis, B-thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy), autosomal dominant diseases (including steinert's disease, Huntington's chorea, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and X-linked diseases (including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, haemophilia, fragile X). Parents may also request PGD to choose the sex of their unborn child.",
