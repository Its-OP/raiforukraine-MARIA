It is increasingly requested as part of the pre-operative cataract assessment. OCT may also be centred on the optic nerve head and indicated in cases of glaucoma or neuro-ophthalmological pathology;\n\n- the'''<nowiki/>'fluorescein angiography'''<nowiki>: indicated in cases of retinal pathology (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], diabetes, central retinal vein occlusion [CRVO], central retinal artery occlusion [CRCAO], etc.);</nowiki>\n\n- l''''angiography with indocyanine green''' (ICG): indicated in cases of AMD or inflammatory pathology of the posterior segment (posterior uveitis);\n\n- l''''\u00e9lectrophysiologie visuelle''' (electror\u00e9tinogram [ERG], electro-oculogram [EOG], visual evoked potentials [PEV]): the ERG and EOG are useful for diagnosing retinal dystrophies, while the PEV are useful for diagnosing optic neuropathies.\n\n- L'''' ocular ultrasound''': in A mode, its main purpose is to assess the length of the eyeball (in particular to determine the power of the implant during cataract surgery in patients with a very dense cataract); in B mode, its main indication is to detect a possible retinal detachment in the event of an ocular media disorder (cataract or vitreous haemorrhage), or to locate an intraocular foreign body or help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.",
