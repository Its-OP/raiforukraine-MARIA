Adenofibroma===\nThis is a mixed epithelial and conjunctival proliferation occurring in young women (< 25-30 years), including adolescents. Common in young women, it presents as a swelling which is usually painless, well limited, mobile in relation to the skin and the rest of the mammary gland, generally < 30 mm in size, with a firm (renitent) consistency, without any local signs or suspicious adenopathy.\n\n===2.   Fibrocystic mastopathy (FMK)===\nThe most common benign breast disease in women aged between 35 and 50, which may persist after the menopause in women taking HRT. It is revealed by the presence of mastodynia associated with menstrual cycles. Clinical examination reveals :\n\n*a single or multiple, rounded, well-defined, mobile mass of variable consistency (usually soft), which may be tender or even painful (cyst under tension)\n*ambiguous, sensitive discharge, sometimes nipple discharge (whitish, greenish, thick)\n*Absence of suspicious axillary adenopathy\n\n==Carcinoma \"in situ\" ==\nThere are two types of \"in situ\" (non-invasive) carcinoma of the breast: ductal carcinoma \"in situ\" (also known as intracanal), and lobular carcinoma \"in situ\". The cells involved have no metastatic potential because they do not cross the basement membrane.\n\n==Malignant tumours==\nAnatomopathological analysis is used to confirm the diagnosis and assess prognostic and predictive factors. In the majority of cases, breast cancers are non-specific infiltrating adenocarcinomas (usually abbreviated to carcinomas) (also known as infiltrating ductal carcinomas).\n\nAnatomopathology will make it possible to specify the following elements:\n\n*Histological type (non-specific infiltrating carcinoma, infiltrating lobular carcinoma, etc.)\n*Elston and Ellis grade (Scarff-Bloom and Richardson modified)\n*Percentage of hormone receptor expression (oestrogen and progesterone)\n*HER2 status\n*Ki67 (reflects cell proliferation)\n*Number of tumour lesions (on surgical specimen only)\n*Size (on surgical specimen only)\n*Number of invaded axillary lymph nodes (on surgical specimen only)\n*Microscopically complete resection (R0) or invaded resection margins (R1) (on the surgical specimen only)\n\n<br />",
