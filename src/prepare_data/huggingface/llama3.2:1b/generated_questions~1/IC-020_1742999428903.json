Example: yellow fingernails and lung cancer.\n** In an etiological study, a risk factor is called an '''etiological factor''' when its causal nature for the health phenomenon studied is implied/supposed/proven. Example: smoking and lung cancer.\n** Similarly, in a prognostic study, a risk factor is called a ''prognostic factor'' when its causal nature for the health phenomenon studied is implied/assumed/proven. Example: metastatic lung cancer and mortality.\n\n'''Health determinants''': factors which influence the state of health of populations, without necessarily being direct causes of particular problems or illnesses.\n\n<br />",
