Stems from the work of Ivan Pavlov on conditioning, and Aaron Beck on cognitivism. Postulates that patients' symptoms stem from inappropriate learned behaviour, dysfunctional cognition and/or difficulties in emotional regulation. CBT then proposes to identify these behaviours, thoughts and emotions and to find alternative adaptive strategies.\n\n- Psychoanalytic psychotherapy: includes both analytically inspired psychotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis. Stems from the work of Sigmund Freud. Postulates that patients' problems are based on unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.\n\n- Family/systemic therapies: consider the family or couple as a dynamic system whose members are in continuous interaction. The patient's symptoms (\"designated patient\", \"symptom carrier\") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs to be rebalanced by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.\n\n- Therapeutic education: therapeutic patient education \"aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease.  It includes organised activities designed to make patients aware of and informed about their illness and care\" (HAS).\n\n- Cognitive remediation: an approach based on neurology, neuropsychology and rehabilitation, enabling patients to improve their cognitive functioning and thus their quality of life.",
