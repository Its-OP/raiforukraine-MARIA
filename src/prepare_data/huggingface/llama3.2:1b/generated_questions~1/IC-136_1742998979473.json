Locoregional anaesthesia can be used for analgesic purposes or as part of chronic pain management (\"''[[Acute postoperative pain SD-034|acute postoperative pain]]''\"), '''[[Prevention of pain associated with care SD-258|prevention of pain associated with care]]''''\", \"''[[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]]''''\")\n\n- '''Local anaesthesia:''' administration of a local anaesthetic by infiltration or topical route to the area to be operated on or analgesized. This is the only type of anaesthetic that can be performed by any doctor, whatever their speciality.\n\nThe anaesthetic process for a scheduled procedure is summarised in figure 1 (see 2C-136-PC-A01). The anaesthetic process is identical for both general and locoregional anaesthesia (\"''[[Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]]'').",
