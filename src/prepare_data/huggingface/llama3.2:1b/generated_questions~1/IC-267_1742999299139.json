More than 40% of serum calcium is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. In the case of hypoalbuminemia: corrected Ca = (40 - albumin) \u00d7 0.025 + [total Ca].\n\n<br />\n\n*Calcemia measurement to look for hypocalcemia when :\n**symptoms suggestive of hypocalcaemia (neuromuscular disorders, cardiac disorders)\n**pathology at risk of hypocalcaemia (chronic renal failure, history of parathyroid surgery).",
