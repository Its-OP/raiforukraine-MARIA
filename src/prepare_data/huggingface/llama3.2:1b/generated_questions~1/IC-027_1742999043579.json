When they become pregnant, these women, who have never identified themselves as drug addicts and do not use specialist services, become aware of their addiction, find themselves at a loss and experience their pregnancy alone and with guilt.\n\nIt is essential to identify them so that multidisciplinary care can be provided, and this is most often the responsibility of perinatal professionals.\n\n'''293.
