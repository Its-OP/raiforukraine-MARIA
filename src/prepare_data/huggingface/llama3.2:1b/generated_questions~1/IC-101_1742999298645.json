Recovery begins 8 to 15 days after onset, and is generally cured in less than 2 months.\n\n2) Unfavourable trend :\n\n* 5 to 10% of cases. Possible sequelae are :\n\n- Residual synkinetic movements\n\n- Post-paralytic facial hemi-spasm, resulting in a brief (often repeated) contracture of the eyelids and cheek of the hemi-face (treatment with botulinum toxin injections) ([[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|localised or generalised muscle contracture]]; [[Abnormal movements SDD-126|abnormal movements]]; [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|palpebral anomalies]]).\n\n- Crocodile tears\" syndrome (watering during meals), rare and secondary to aberrant reinnervation.\n\n* Severe persistent deficit, with disabling deformity of the face and absence of reinnervation on ENMG (discussion of cosmetic surgery) ([[Muscular weakness SDD-074|Muscular weakness]]; [[Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Sensory and/or motor deficit]]).",
