Primary RA is the most common (4 out of 5 cases).\n\nClinical examination, in search of arguments to cast doubt on the primary origin of the RA. The clinical features that raise the suspicion of secondary RA are :\n\n*male sex;\n* onset after the age of 40\n* absence of summer remission;\n* no family history of RA;\n* Involvement of the thumbs;\n* unilateral;\n*digital ulcers (or retractile scars ('''''[[Abnormal scar SD-083|abnormal scar]]''''') of digital ulcers ('''''[[Skin ulcer SD-092|skin ulcer]])''''' ;\n* abolition of a pulse ;\n*a pathological Allen manoeuvre.\n\nAs well as:\n\n- clinical features suggestive of scleroderma: telangiectasia, sclerodactyly, subcutaneous calcinosis, pyrosis, etc.\n\n- occupational exposure to vibrating machinery or repetitive hand trauma '''''([[Pr\u00e9vention des risques professionnels SD-315|prevention of occupational risks]]'')'',\n\n- iatrogenic effects of a drug or toxic treatment (e.g. tryptans, \u03b2-blockers, clonidine....)
