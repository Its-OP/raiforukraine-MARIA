      "option_a": "Cardiogenic shock is characterized by a high cardiac output, while hypovolemic shock is characterized by a low cardiac output.",
      "option_b": "Cardiogenic shock is caused by a myocardial infarction, while hypovolemic shock is caused by a severe blood loss.",
      "option_c": "Cardiogenic shock is typically associated with a high blood pressure, while hypovolemic shock is typically associated with a low blood pressure.",
      "option_d": "Cardiogenic shock is often diagnosed using a CBC, while hypovolemic shock is often diagnosed using a chest X-ray.",
