It should be intensified in the following clinical situations:\n\n- history of FAS/malformative syndrome in the offspring (very high risk of recurrence);\n\n- drug addiction (30-50% of patients on drug substitutes drink alcohol);\n\n- context of domestic violence, sexual abuse ;\n\n- psychiatric disorders, depression ;\n\n- heavy smoking ;\n\n- ultrasound findings of growth retardation or malformations.\n\nIt is important to adopt an empathetic attitude and a non-judgemental framework, preferring indirect and/or open-ended questions: \"Before pregnancy, how many drinks did you have a day? And now?\" or \"Is it difficult for you not to drink alcohol now? A good method is to use validated self-questionnaires such as the T-ACE, which even seem to be more sensitive than questioning in detecting maternal alcohol consumption.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|T\n|How many drinks do you have to have before you feel the first effects of alcohol?\n|2 points if \u2265 3 drinks\n|-\n|A\n|Have you ever been bothered by people criticising you for your drinking?\n|1 point if yes\n|-\n|C\n|Do you sometimes feel the need to reduce your consumption?\n|1 point if yes\n|-\n|E\n|Do you sometimes have a drink as soon as you get out of bed in the morning to calm down or get rid of a hangover?\n|1 point if yes\n|}\n''High score = 2 points or more''\n\n'''293.
