The foetal impact is well documented, with a risk of FAS.\n\n- Occasional, light or moderate consumption: around 1 to 2 drinks per day. There is no dysmorphic or malformative syndrome. In the case of occasional or light alcohol consumption, the scientific data are reassuring regarding the occurrence of long-term cognitive or behavioural problems. In the case of moderate drinking, studies are contradictory, but there is a risk of alteration in behavioural scores, as well as affective and/or anxiety disorders.\n\n- Binge drinking: this is common in early pregnancy, when the pregnancy is still unknown. There is no proven impact of a binge drinking episode (\u2265 4 drinks in one go) on the occurrence of foetal malformations or cognitive-behavioural disorders at this stage of pregnancy, provided that the episode remains isolated and is not repeated thereafter. Later on, during pregnancy - particularly in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters - acute alcohol consumption (5 drinks) can lead to cognitive problems as a result of impaired neuronal migration.",
