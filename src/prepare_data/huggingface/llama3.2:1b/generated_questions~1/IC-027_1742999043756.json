The general principles of withdrawal are the same as outside pregnancy.\n\nAppropriate nicotine replacement therapy is often necessary to help pregnant women give up smoking. In order to adapt the dosage, dependence on nicotine should be assessed prior to pregnancy, using the Fagerstr\u00f6m questionnaire, and sometimes the level of intoxication should be measured by means of exhaled CO (CO analyser).\n\nMedical interventions to help people stop smoking are essentially individualised aids. There are several types:\n\n- Advice and information tailored to the smoker's motivation and history, delivered to the patient using a variety of media: factsheets, electronic resources or telephone calls;\n\n- Information given to the woman on her level of smoking by objective measurement (CO analyser);\n\n- Psychological and/or behavioural approaches:\n\n- Minimal advice on quitting: this consists of asking about smoking status, whether or not there is a plan to quit and providing a simple written document on the subject,\n\n- Brief intervention: this involves probing the interview with open-ended questions.\n\n- Motivational interviewing: this consists of seeking out and highlighting the patient's personal motivations for considering or building up withdrawal,\n\n- Cognitive-behavioural therapy: this involves developing practical ways of getting round and overcoming cravings,\n\n- Psychological consultation,\n\n- Addictology consultation in the case of associated drug use ;\n\n- Nicotine prescription given to the patient in the event of pharmacological dependence ;\n\n- Other interventions that have been evaluated include hypnosis.\n\n'''293.
