The term benign prostatic hyperplasia is used to describe clinical [[Urinary incontinence and voiding disorders in adults and the elderly|lower urinary tract symptoms 125]] symptoms that can be clinically and paraclinically linked to benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nNatural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia: BPH is common (80% of men over the age of 60).
