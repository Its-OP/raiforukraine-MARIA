Identify a [[Headache SD-118|headache]]=\n- '''Adult and child of talking age''': the patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.\n\n- Infants and small children: atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilisation of the head, or on the contrary a prostrate, analgesic attitude.\n\n=2.     Reasoning when faced with a headache=\n- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.\n\n- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)\n\n- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?\n\n- '''Other features:'''\n\n- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)\n\n- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days\n\n- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)\n\n- Triggering and aggravating factors\n\n- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)\n\n- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated\n\n- '''Context of occurrence:'''\n\n- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors\n\n- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?\n\n- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)\n\n- '''Associated signs:'''\n\n- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]\n\n- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia\n\n- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]\n\n- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles\n\n- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]\n\n- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses\n\n- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month\n\n=4.

Other blood group antigens may be involved much more rarely and with a lower risk (anti-E).\n\n\nThis situation can lead to foetal anaemia in cases of foetal-maternal blood incompatibility. If the foetus has the erythrocyte antigen corresponding to the maternal antibody, the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta may be responsible for haemolysis and therefore foetal anaemia.

The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, the infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy, or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or in the family.\n\nThe risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately :\n\n- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labour ;\n\n- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding the work ;\n\n- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions ;\n\n- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes.\n\nThe risk is therefore minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes, but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of cases of neonatal herpes are ultimately observed in this situation. This is because :\n\n- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes;\n\n- but 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently: genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognised.\n\nVHB\n\nOne per cent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:\n\n- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test);( if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended.\n\n- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies[VFC(2] .\n\n- In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated.\n\nTransmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.     \n\nSero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended and the neonatologist should be informed.\n\n'''HIV'''\n\nMother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.\n\nVertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:\n\n- pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the foetus via the placenta.\n\n- intrapartum (infection during childbirth)\n\n- post-partum (via breast-feeding). 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth.\n\nTransmission can be influenced by several factors:\n\n- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load and low CD4 lymphocyte levels;\n\n- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery and intra-uterine infection (chorioamniotitis);\n\n- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries ;\n\n- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection.\n\n'''VZV'''\n\nTransmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes you to the risk of\n\n- ''Embryofetopathy'': the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation: amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy.\n\n- Shingles'' in the 1<sup>rst</sup> year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and > 3 weeks of childbirth)\n\n- '''Varicella neonatorum''': for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. '''93. [[Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) SD-093|Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal)]]'''''\n\n- In the case of maternal varicella, there is still a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

Before 11 weeks' gestation, the incidence of foetal infection is around 90%. This frequency then decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception takes place after the rash, the risk of foetal infection is probably low, since the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia. When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major foetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.\n\nThere are two situations\n\n- '''Polymalformative syndrome''' including neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus or interventricular communication, etc.). It can be complicated by miscarriage or foetal death in utero;\n\n- Progressive congenital rubella'' which corresponds to chronic generalised viral infection. It reflects the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months: these newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 months' gestation. When it is symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed. These multi-visceral lesions may regress or leave sequelae. The long-term prognosis for congenital rubella that is symptomatic at birth is guarded, especially as regards psychomotor and auditory development.\n\nThe WHO defines congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) as follows:\n\n- A case of \"CRS\" is a child with 2 complications from group A (cataract and/or congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, pigmentary retinopathy) or 1 from group A + one from group B (purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, meningoencephalitis, bone mineralisation anomalies, early neonatal jaundice). The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for specific IgM antibodies in the neonatal period.\n\n- A case of ''CRI'' is a child who does not fit into the previous definition and who has positive specific IgM in the neonatal period.",

Its incidence in France is around 1 to 2/1000 in its complete form, and it is often under-diagnosed. This syndrome combines four elements, to varying degrees:\n\n- Moderate intrauterine growth retardation\n\n- Typical facial dysmorphia including :\n\no Abnormalities of the upper lip (thinness) and philtrum (bulging)\n\no Pronounced nasal bridge, short nose\n\no Narrow palpebral fissures, epicanthus and hypertelorism\n\no Bilateral Ptosis\n\no Hypertrichosis with synophrisis\n\no Cleared chin with retrognathism\n\no Low and badly hemmed ears\n\n- Malformations: present in 10 to 30% of severe forms: mainly neurological (spina bifida, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar anomalies, hydrocephalus, etc.), cardiac (mainly CIA and CIV), skeletal (scoliosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, clinodactyly, etc.) and facial (cleft lip and palate).\n\n- delayed acquisition, combining cognitive and behavioural problems of varying intensity. In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5/1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing;\n\n'''115.

Three types of CI are classically distinguished:\n\n\u00d8 ''Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF \u226440%)'' caused by failure of myocardial contraction.\n\n\u00d8 ''Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%'' generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.\n\n\u00d8 '''Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction LVEF \u226550%.'''
