In practice, the causes of headaches that peak in less than an hour are the same as those of thunderclap headaches.\n\n===='''1. Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) or meningeal haemorrhage (<u>item 341</u>)'''====\n- SAH or meningeal haemorrhage: cause of 10 to 25% of sudden headaches .\n\n- Typical headache (SAH due to rupture of aneurysm): explosive, thunderclap-like, severe, associated with other signs of meningeal syndrome and persistent [[Cervicogenic pain SD-144|cervicalgia]].\n\n- Sometimes an isolated, short-lived headache (meningeal epistaxis of low severity, preceding a massive SAH).\n\n- Associated signs: [[Convulsions SD-120|comitial seizures]], [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|focal deficit]] (if cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage), III paralysis (compression by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery or carotid termination) and/or [[Coma and consciousness disorder SD-028|consciousness disorder]] (transient or coma).\n<br />\n\n===='''2. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)'''====\n- RVCS: 10 to 45% of thunderclap headaches in emergency departments; under-diagnosed because of recent description (2007).\n\n- SVCR: segmental and diffuse vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, reversible within 3 months. May be complicated by cortical SAH without aneurysm and stroke ('''<u>item 340</u>''') (either cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral infarction).\n\n- Typical headache: thunderclap headache, lasting 5 minutes to several hours and recurring over 1 to 3 weeks, usually provoked by exertion, emotion, Valsalva or sexual activity.\n\n- Other associated signs: hypertensive crisis, [[Convulsions SD-120|comitial seizures]] and/or [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|focal deficit]].\n\n- Evocative contexts: postpartum, exposure to vasoactive substances (cannabis, cocaine, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, nasal decongestants or triptan) or stress.\n<br />\n\n===='''3. Rarer causes of sudden headache'''====\nThe following sudden headaches have few specific characteristics and should be investigated after ruling out SAH and if the picture does not suggest CVRS.\n\n- '''Intracerebral hemorrhage''': headache sometimes isolated, with [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|focal deficit]] absent or very discreet (frontal or cerebellar hemorrhage) (see stroke '''<u>item 340</u>''')\n\n- '''Ischaemic stroke''': headache sometimes isolated, with [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|focal deficit]] absent or very discrete (especially in cerebellar infarction) (see stroke '''<u>item 340</u>''')\n\n- '''Dissection of cervical arteries''' : [[Headache SD-118|headache]] acute with [[Neck pain SD-144|cervicalgia]]\n\no Carotid dissection: on the side of the dissection: Claude-Bernard Horner, pulsatile tinnitus, paralysis of XII, orbital pain\n\no Vertebral dissection: posterior neck pain SD-144|cervicalgia\n\no Headache precedes signs of retinal or cerebral ischaemia (transient amaurosis, TIA or stroke) (stroke '''<u>item 340</u>''')\n\n- '''Cerebral venous thrombosis''': more often gives progressive headaches by JTIC, but sometimes brutal headaches (stroke '''<u>item 340</u>''')\n\n- '''Pituitary apoplexy or necrosis:''' abrupt headache, visual disturbances, bitemporal hemianopsia, then signs of pituitary insufficiency, postpartum setting, sometimes complicates a pituitary adenoma (pituitary adenoma '''<u>item 244</u>''')\n\n- '''Cardiovascular causes''' (myocardial ischaemia, aortic dissection) by projected pain: rare\n\n- '''Acute HTIC''' : '''acute hydrocephalus''' on certain intracranial tumours ('''<u>item 299</u>)''' compressing the 3rd or 4th ventricle, transient brutal headache on movement or coughing, later becoming permanent.\n\n- '''Hypertensive encephalopathy and eclampsia''': headache preceding the signs of encephalopathy ([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|consciousness disorders]] \u00b1 [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|focal deficits]] \u00b1 [[Convulsions SD-120|epilepsy]]) with hypertension.\n\n- ''Intracranial hypotension'': postural orthostatic headache that disappears with decubitus; most often revealed by a progressive headache\n\n- '''Meningitis and meningoencephalitis''' '''(<u>item 151</u>)''': headache with infectious syndrome; most often reveals itself as a progressive headache\n\n- '''Giant cell arteritis''' ('''<u>item 195</u>'''') ''':''' to be considered in the presence of any recent and unusual headache in a subject > 50 years of age, including in the presence of a sudden headache after ruling out other causes\n\n- '''Acute blocked sinusitis''' (''<u>item 148</u>'''): headache that increases with the head bent forward, should be considered as a diagnosis of exclusion (after ruling out neurological causes of sudden headache).\n\n- '''Acute angle closure glaucoma''' ('''<u>item 84</u>'''): violent retrobulbar or periorbital headache, light halos, decreased visual acuity, [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]] and [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|red eye]] and mydriatic pupil",
