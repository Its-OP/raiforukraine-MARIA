Invasive examination '''(pre-operative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure)''''\n\n=== - Principles of ACS management ===\n=> ST+ ACS: the emergency is coronary unblocking.\n\n           - assessment of the time between the ECG (diagnosis of ST+) and arrival in the coronary angiography suite for placement of the angioplasty guide (start of angioplasty)\n\n           - if delay \u2264 120 min, primary angioplasty is recommended\n\n           - if > 120 min: fibrinolysis is preferred (unless contraindicated, except for symptoms >12 hours) followed by salvage angioplasty in the absence of reperfusion or deferred within 24 hours if reperfusion occurs\n\n- for ACS >12 hours after onset of pain: primary angioplasty remains indicated in cases of persistent pain, haemodynamic instability or rhythmic instability (ventricular rhythm disorders). Angioplasty should be considered up to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms; beyond that, in the absence of chest pain, viability should first be sought in the infarcted territory.\n\n\n=> Non-ST+ ACS: coronary angiography generally within 24 hours (particularly if troponin is elevated). NB: special case of non-ST+ ACS refractory to medical treatment (patient still in pain) who must be taken urgently (<2 hours) to the coronary angiography suite.",
