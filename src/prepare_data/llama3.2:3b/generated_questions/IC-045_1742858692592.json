Penetrance is complete, but expressivity and severity are extremely variable. The disease combines pulmonary involvement with external pancreatic insufficiency.\n\n'''Manifestations in the neonatal period'''\n\nDelayed release of meconium or meconium ileus (occlusion).\n\nManifestations in infants\n\n- Digestive signs\n\nSteatorrhea ([[Diarrhea SD-002|diarrhea]] greasy and foul), associated with [[Abdominal pain SD-004|abdominal pain]] and malnutrition.\n\nStaturo-ponderal retardation ([[Staturo-ponderal growth anomalies SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]), hypoprotidemia, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency\n\n[Constipation SD-001|Constipation, which may be complicated by rectal prolapse\n\n- Respiratory signs\n\nChronic [[Cough SD-167|Cough]]\n\nRecurrent respiratory infections: bronchitis, pneumonitis, rhinosinusitis\n\n\nManifestations in children, adolescents and adults\n\n-Chronic respiratory disease\n\n[[Dyspnea SD-162|Dyspnea]], wheezing, [[Cough SD-167|cough]], [[Expectoration SD-163|expectoration]] mucopurulent\n\nRepeated (chronic) bronchial infections: the germs most often involved are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n- Damage to the upper airways\n\nRecurrent sinusitis\n\nNasal polyps\n\n- Pancreatic and digestive disorders\n\n[[Constipation SD-001|Constipation]]\n\n[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency: steatorrhea, malabsorption, malnutrition, pancreatitis, diabetes\n\nHepatobiliary disease: jaundice, biliary cirrhosis ([[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]])\n\n- Damage to the genital tract\n\nIn men: atresia of the vas deferens (98%), leading to obstructive azoospermia and infertility ([[Difficulty procreating SD-033|difficulty procreating]]).\n\nIn women: inconstant hypofertility (thick cervical mucus).\n\n- Other symptoms\n\nJoint pain secondary to arthritis\n\nSalt loss syndrome: dehydration, metabolic alkalosis",
