Urgent neuroradiological investigation.\n\n- Ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular accidents\n\n- Carotidocavernous fistula\n\n'''Tumours:''' the cause of a quarter of oculomotor paralyses. Systematically request neuroradiological investigations.\n\n- intracranial hypertension: bilateral VI paralysis with no localising value\n\n- skull base tumours\n\n'''Traumatic''': fracture of the floor of the orbit\n\n'''Multiple sclerosis:''' revealed by oculomotor paralysis in 10% of cases.\n\n- VI paralysis\n\n- anterior internuclear palsy\n\n'''Myasthenia:''' non-painful diplopia, fluctuating, worsening with fatigue, sometimes associated with variable ptosis.\n\nOrbital involvement: Graves' disease, tumours of the orbit. Particularly if associated exophthalmos.   \n\n'''If pain:''' rule out an intracranial aneurysm, carotid dissection or carotid-cavernous fistula. Diabetes is the most common cause of painful diplopia. Horton's disease presents in elderly patients with fronto-orbital headaches \u00b1 POM, \u00b1 NOIA.",
