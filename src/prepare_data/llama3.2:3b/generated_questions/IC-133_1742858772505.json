On the day when the principal is no longer physically or mentally capable of looking after his or her own interests, the authorised representative will be able to protect the principal's personal and/or property interests.\n\n\n- '''Habilitation familiale'''\n\nFamily authorisation allows a relative (descendant, ascendant, brother or sister, husband or wife, cohabitee, PACS partner) to seek the judge's authorisation to represent a person who is unable to express his or her wishes.\n\n\n- '''Sauvegarde de justice'''\n\nSafeguard of justice is a short-term legal protection measure that allows an adult to be represented to carry out certain acts. This measure can avoid the need for a guardianship or curatorship, which are more restrictive. The adult retains the exercise of his or her rights, subject to certain exceptions.\n\n\n- '''Curatelle / curatelle renforc\u00e9e'''\n\nGuardianship is a legal measure designed to protect a person of full age who, although not in a position to act themselves, needs to be advised or supervised in certain acts of civil life. Guardianship is only ordered if it is established that legal protection would provide insufficient protection. There are several degrees of curatorship. The Protection Litigation Judge appoints one or more curators.\n\n\n- '''Guardianship'''\n\nGuardianship is a legal measure designed to protect an adult and/or all or part of their assets if they are no longer able to look after their own interests. A guardian represents the person in all acts of civil life. The judge may, at any time, list the acts that the person may or may not perform alone, on a case-by-case basis.",
