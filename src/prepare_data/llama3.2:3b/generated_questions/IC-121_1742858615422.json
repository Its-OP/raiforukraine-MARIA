These methods must be combined if they are to be effective both medically and socially.\n\nTherapeutic education. This may involve the patient and/or his family. It consists of providing information on the psychological disorders concerned, their treatment and learning methods to improve the management of difficulties linked to these disorders.\n\nCertain [[Different types of psychotherapeutic techniques|psychotherapies]] such as cognitive-behavioural therapies (see item 73) or methods such as social skills training help to manage interpersonal relationships better and limit the impact of cognitive biases.\n\nCognitive remediation. It is offered after a cognitive or neuropsychological assessment that evaluates neurocognitive functions (memory, attention, executive functions, etc.), metacognition and social cognition. Cognitive remediation aims to restore impaired functions and/or develop compensatory strategies by strengthening preserved functions in order to limit the consequences of these impairments. It is particularly effective when the skills learned can be used in specific everyday tasks or in a job.",
