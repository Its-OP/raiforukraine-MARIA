In fact, if exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy (e.g. positive specific IgE to peanuts, even though the patient eats peanuts without any problem, means sensitisation and not allergy). This is important because it is not necessary to avoid the food in this case, or ''it may cause a long-term allergy to this food'' (break in tolerance).   \n\n\nMulti-allergenic tests can also detect atopy with very good sensitivity (>90%).",
