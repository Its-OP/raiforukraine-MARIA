Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children)\n\n- If confusion has set in suddenly (suspected stroke item 340).\n\nOutside the context of confusion, a ''cerebral MRI'' is essential for diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder and therefore Alzheimer's disease. In the event of contraindication, a cerebral CT scan will be performed '''([[Request for an imaging examination SDD-231|request for an imaging examination]])'''. The objectives are :\n\n- rule out a non-degenerative cause, looking in particular for :\n\no an intracranial expansive process (intra- or extracerebral tumour, subdural haematoma, etc.)''([[Discovery of a brain anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain anomaly on medical imaging examination]])'' (cf item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma)\n\no hydrocephalus (see item 109. Gait and balance disorders and cf. item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic hydrocephalus in adults )\n\no ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular lesions (useful sequences: T2/FLAIR and T2 gradient echo, respectively): it is particularly for analysing vascular lesions that MRI is far superior to CT (see item 132 question Positive diagnosis - Vascular encephalopathy).\n\n- look for cerebral atrophy\n\no assess the presence of cortical or subcortical atrophy and its topography (frontal, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal as in frontotemporal lobar degeneration [see item 132 question Frontotemporal lobar degeneration], posterior or global as in Alzheimer's disease)\n\no visually assess hippocampal atrophy (useful sequence: coronal T1 with a slice plane perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus), using the Scheltens hippocampal atrophy assessment scale (subjective measure which depends on the clinician's experience).",
