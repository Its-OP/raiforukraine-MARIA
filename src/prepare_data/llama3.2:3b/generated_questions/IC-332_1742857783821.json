Injection 0.01 mg/kg (0.5 mg per 50 kg)\n\n- Location: lateral surface of the middle 1/3 thigh, in the vastus lateralis\n\n- The IV route is possible but should be reserved for trained teams: titration +++ 0.001 mg/kg (10 times less than IM!)\n\n- Repeat every 5 minutes\n\n- Crystalloid volume expansion\n\nStage 3: Investigation and management of associated respiratory failure\n\n- If respiratory distress: patient in sitting position\n\n- Lower airway obstruction: aerosols of \u03b22-mimetics (salbutamol)\n\n- Upper airway obstruction: aerosols of adrenaline (5 mg nebulised)\n\n\nNB: IV corticosteroid therapy with 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone is not an emergency and is used to prevent relapse. Antihistamines are only effective on mucocutaneous signs.",
