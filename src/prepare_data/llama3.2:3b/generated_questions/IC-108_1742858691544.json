(see item 132)\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Know the principles of therapeutic management of a confused patient.\n|Description=Emergency prescriptions and treatment of the cause.\n|Rubric=Management\n|Contributors=\n|Order=6}}\nMental confusion is a diagnostic and therapeutic ''medical emergency'', almost always requiring immediate hospitalisation because both the cause of the confusion and the confusion itself can be deleterious.\n\n- The first priority is to assess the short-term impact (vitals) and immediately treat any vital problems (shock, hypothermia, etc.).\n\n- The second stage is the search for the cause (see previous item), which is an integral part of the treatment: the treatment of the confusional episode cannot be considered independently of its cause.\n\n- Non-specific treatment :\n\no rehydration, if necessary by parenteral route; maintenance of nutrition ;\n\no frequent and regular monitoring of vital signs and consciousness ;\n\no Withdraw all non-essential drugs or use the smallest possible doses, avoid confusing psychotropic drugs (anticholinergics +++), unless there is a risk associated with abrupt withdrawal (benzodiazepines) '''([[Follow-up consultation for a patient with multiple drug dependence SD-266|consultation de suivi d'un patient polym\u00e9diqu\u00e9]])'''''\n\no sedative psychotropic drugs only if they are essential, in small doses and with precautions: prefer anxiolytic benzodiazepines with a short half-life (oxazepam) to neuroleptics, which are reserved for cases of major agitation posing a risk to the patient or those around them '''([[Agitation SDD-114|agitation]]; [[Prescribe a hypnotic/anxiolytic SDD-256|prescrire un hypnotique/anxiolytique]])''''\n\no assessment and management of acute pain '''([[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]])''''\n\no A quiet patient in a single room with subdued lighting and an open door for surveillance;\n\no avoid, as far as possible, physical restraint, which aggravates agitation and anxiety '''([[Setting up and monitoring mechanical restraint SDD-244|Setting up and monitoring mechanical restraint]])''''\n\nIt is important not to be too quick to conclude that treatment is ineffective, as the confusional syndrome may take some time to regress.",
