It should be suspected by the discovery of a ''[[Discovery of a vascular murmur SD-019|''vascular murmur'']]''' or by the abolition of peripheral pulses in a subject with cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nSymptomatic AOMI manifests itself either as [[Intermittent limb claudication SD-069|'''''muscular pain on walking''''']] forcing the patient to stop walking (claudication), or by [[Chronic pain SD-035|'''''permanent pain''''']] of a [[Pain in a limb (upper or lower) SD-071|'''''limb''''']] or by a '''''[[Skin ulcer SD-092|trophic disorder]]''''' associated or not (symptoms at rest).\n\nSexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction SD-063|'''''dysfonction \u00e9rectile''''']], in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, should be investigated for OSA.\n\n===Diagnosis===\nA clinical and haemodynamic classification is used. It is based on the search for symptoms and the measurement of perfusion pressures: systolic ankle pressure index (SAPI = ratio of ankle pressure to brachial pressure), ankle pressure and big toe pressure.\n\nA distinction is made between :\n\n*asymptomatic patients (SPI \u2264 0.90)\n*claudication: exertional ischaemia stage (SPI \u2264 0.90)\n*symptoms at rest: permanent ischaemia stage (ankle pressure < 50 mmHg or big toe pressure < 30 mmHg).\n\nIn the case of diabetes or chronic renal failure, the GPI and ankle pressure are most often inaccurate, as a result of arterial stiffness (calcification of the arterial wall). Diagnosis is then based on measurement of pressure at the big toe (digital pressure). In addition, any finding of an SPI >1.4 should systematically lead to a measurement of toe pressure. The diagnosis of AOMI is accepted in the event of toe pressure < 0.7\n\nThe functional classification of Leriche and Fontaine is no longer used.\n\n===Differential diagnoses===\nThe main differential diagnoses of claudication and their characteristics are detailed in the table below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!'''Origin'''\n!\n'''Arterial'''\n!\n'''Venous'''\n!\n'''Articular'''\n!\n'''Neurological'''\n|-\n!'''Distance of onset'''\n|Always the same\n|Variable\n|From the first steps\n|Variable\n|-\n!\n\n\n\n'''Pain/discomfort''''\n|Cramp-like, of muscular topography requiring rapid cessation of exercise\n|Progressive sensation of painful swelling that does not force you to stop exercising\n|\nMaximum joint topography from the outset\n|\nRelieved by anteflexion Root topography\n|-\nRecovery\n|Fast\n|Slow\n|Slow\n|Slow\n|-\n!\n\n\n\n'''Context'''\n|\nAtheromatous context\n|Deep venous thrombosis of a collecting trunk\n|Arthrosis Trauma sequelae Inflammatory rheumatism\n|\nLumbar osteoarthritis Narrow lumbar canal\n|}\nThe main differential diagnoses of trophic disorders and their characteristics are detailed in the item [[Leg ulcer]] and the starting situation [[Skin ulcer SDD-092]].",
