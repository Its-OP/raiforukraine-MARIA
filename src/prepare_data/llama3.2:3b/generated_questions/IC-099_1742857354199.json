Identify possible factors favouring a migraine</u>'''\n\n- '''Triggers:''' factors which, singly or in combination, trigger attacks in a migraine sufferer. Most patients describe several triggers. The common denominator is a ''change'', either intrinsic (endogenous) or extrinsic (exogenous):\n\no Modifying meals and hydration (timing, quantity and/or quality)\n\no Changes to sleep patterns (quality, duration, wake-up and bedtimes)\n\no Climate changes (atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity)\n\no Hormonal changes (catamenial period, resumption of post-partum migraines)\n\no Intense and unusual physical effort\n\no Negative emotions (anger, annoyance) or positive emotions (birthdays, weddings)\n\no Stress and periods of relaxation (weekends, holidays)\n\no Pharmacological triggers (alcohol, phosphodiesterase inhibitors)\n\n- '''The real triggers are often obvious (alcohol, catamenial period)'''\n\n- '''Hygienic and dietetic rules:''' for patients with an unfavourable lifestyle, but these rules ''will never cure the migraine''.\n\n- Unnecessary avoidance of real or supposed triggers can reduce quality of life and even increase sensitivity to triggers, making migraine worse.\n\n\n'''<u>2.  Identify and prevent possible risk factors for progression to chronic migraine (Table)</u>''''\n\nMigraine ''comorbidities'' are conditions that are more prevalent in migraine sufferers than in control subjects: anxiety, depression, [[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|sleep disorders]], asthma, [[Chronic pain SD-035|chronic pain]] non-headache, cardiovascular disease. These co-morbidities and other risk factors (Box) increase the risk of an episodic migraine developing into a chronic migraine. Treating them can help to improve migraine. They should therefore be ''screened for and prevention and/or treatment offered''.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''Migraine risk factors and prevention'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Risk factors for the transition from an episodic form to a chronic migraine'''\n|'''Prevention or potential treatment'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |'''Socio-demographic factors'''\n\n'''Habits'''\n\n'''Life events'''\n|Female gender\n\nLow household income\n|Not modifiable\n|-\n|Sedentary lifestyle\n|Education, encouraging physical activity\n|-\n|Coffee > 3 cups/day\n|Education, stop or reduce coffee\n|-\n|Psychological and sexual trauma and abuse\n|Prevention of physical, psychological and sexual violence, stress reduction techniques\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |'''Headache Characteristics'''\n|Frequency of headaches\n|'''Preventive treatment of migraine'''\n|-\n|Persistent headaches\n|Migraine preventive treatment\n|-\n|Allodynia of the skin\n|Migraine preventive treatment\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |'''Comorbidities'''\n|'''Depression'''\n|'''Screening HAH scale, treatment'''\n|-\n|Asthma, other respiratory conditions\n|Specific treatment\n|-\n|Obesity\n|Balanced diet and exercise\n|-\n|Chronic neck and/or back pain\n|Physical activity, physiotherapy, information on drug abuse, avoidance of opiates\n|-\n|Cranial or cervical trauma\n|Education, wearing a helmet\n|-\n|[[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|Snoring,]]\n\n[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|Insomnia]]\n|Sleep management techniques, avoiding benzodiazepines and hypnotics, specific treatments\n|-\n|[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]], cardiovascular diseases\n|Systematic screening for hypertension and possible treatment, combating other vascular risk factors\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Crisis treatment''''\n|Drug abuse\n|'''Education, screening for drug abuse, avoiding opiates'''\n|-\n|Ineffective crisis treatment\n|Optimisation of crisis treatment\n|}\n- The most important ''modifiable risk factors'' for progression to ''chronic migraine'' are :\n\n*- '''High frequency of headaches at the base: to be monitored using the seizure diary''' *- '''Depression:'' to be screened using the HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression).\n*- Depression: to be screened using the HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression).\n*- ''Overuse of crisis treatment'': to be monitored using the diary.",
