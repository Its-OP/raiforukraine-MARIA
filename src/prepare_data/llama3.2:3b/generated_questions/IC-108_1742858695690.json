Item 132 Positive diagnosis Psychological and behavioural symptoms of dementia): possibly present to varying degrees at all stages of AD, they are very frequent at this stage: agitation or apathy '''([[Agitation SDD-114|agitation]], [[Apathy SDD-117|apathy]])''', hallucinations '''([[Hallucinations SDD-122|hallucinations]])''', delusional disorders '''([[Delusional ideas SDD-124|delusional ideas]])''', wandering, sleep disorders '''([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SDD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia]])'''' and appetite disorders\n\no neurological and somatic disorders : walking and posture disorders with falls '''([[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]], [[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])''', epilepsy (corresponding items), myoclonus '''([[Abnormal movements SDD-126|abnormal movements]])''', sphincter control disorders '''([[Urinary incontinence SD-103|urinary incontinence]]),''' and undernutrition '''([[Undernutrition/malnutrition SDD-030|undernutrition/malnutrition]])'''''\n\no death from a general complication due to the bedridden state (bronchial superinfection, following a fall with prolonged bed rest...) or by sudden death '''([[Swallowing disorders or miscarriage SDD-062|swallowing disorders or miscarriage]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]], [[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]], [[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]])''''\n\nFollow-up consists of detecting, preventing or compensating through supportive care for the clinical manifestations of AD at all stages and their associated complications '''([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])'''",
