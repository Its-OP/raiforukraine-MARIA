Causes directly related to the product may also be found, and linked to the labelling, packaging or nomenclature of the product.\n<br />\n\n==Characterisation of an error==\n\n*its classification: \"error, potential error or risk of error\".\n*its stage: prescribing, dispensing, preparation, administration, therapeutic follow-up, etc.\n*the nature of the error: drug, dose, dosage/concentration, route of administration, flow rate, administration technique, patient, time of administration, duration of administration, omission, etc.\n*their causes: communication problems, human factors, name confusion, labelling and/or information problems, packaging or design problems, etc.\n\n<br />\n\n==Consequences==\nA medication error can result in :\n\n*An adverse event resulting in harm to the patient\n*A near miss in which the patient almost suffered harm\n*No harm or risk of harm",
