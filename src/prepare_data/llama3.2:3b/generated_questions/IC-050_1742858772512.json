It is bilateral in 10 to 20% of cases.\n*On clinical examination, it is impossible to palpate the testicle in the bursa. The hernial orifices are closed.\n*Three topographical diagnoses are possible:\n**An undescended testicle which can be palpated on the normal migration path: the gonad is in the inguinal canal or at the upper root of the bursa.\n**An undescended testicle that can be palpated outside its normal migratory route: formerly known as \"true ectopia\", the testicle may be in a femoral, pubopenic or crossed intrascrotal position.\n**An undescended testicle that cannot be palpated.\n*If, on clinical examination, the testicle is easily lowered by hand to the bottom of the bursa without tension, this is an oscillating testicle (\"lift\") and not cryptorchidism.\n\n\n\n<br />",
