Its appearance is polymorphic, with lesions generally consisting of translucent pearly papules of firm consistency associated with telangiectasias. The pearls vary in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres.\n\nThere are 3 clinical forms:\n\n* Nodular BCC (a translucent papule or nodule covered with telangiectasia) (Figure a), which includes planar scarring BCC (a plaque of variable size with a progressive spread, a whitish atrophocicatricial centre and a peripheral pearly border),\n* Superficial BCC (thin plaque with a pearly border or well-limited erythematosquamous plaque occurring preferentially on the trunk) (Figure b),\n* Sclerodermiform BCC (yellowish-white, hard, poorly limited plaque).\n*\n\nIn these 3 forms, there may be associated ulceration and/or pigmentation.\n\n\nBCC is a slowly progressing tumour of purely local malignancy, which may progressively extend into neighbouring tissues, particularly along embryonic fusion planes and nerve sheaths. Metastatic forms are exceptional.\n\n\n\n\nEC often starts on predisposing skin lesions:\n\n* ACTINIC KERATOSIS (SENILES) (Figure c)\n** Red, keratotic, rough patches, bleeding after removal.\n** Multiple on exposed areas\n** Sometimes confluent\n** Non-healing\n* CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY LESIONS :\n** Radiodermatitis,\n** Chronic leg ulcers,\n** Cheilitis,\n** Burn scars,\n** Leukoplakia <br />\n\nEC can occur on the skin, but also on mucous membranes and semi-mucous membranes.\n\n\nThere are 2 main forms of CE:\n\n* In situ EC or Bowen's disease is usually a single, fixed lesion in a photo-exposed area, erythematous or pinkish +/- pigmented, well-defined and squamous-crusted.\n\n\n\nIf carcinoma is suspected, a biopsy should be taken and an anatomopathological examination carried out to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nThe clinical examination must include :\n\n* the search for other carcinomas and/or melanomas over the whole of the skin;\n* search for adenopathy in the drainage area (CE).  <br />There is no indication for a systematic extension work-up, unless the form is aggressive, the patient is at particular risk (immunocompromised) or there are clinical signs of loco-regional extension \u2794 lymph node ultrasound, thoraco-abdominal CT scan, PET scan.",
