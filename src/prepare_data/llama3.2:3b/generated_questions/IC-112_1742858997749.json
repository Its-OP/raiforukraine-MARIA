However, it should also be suspected in the presence of vesicular lesions, urticarial plaques, eczematous lesions and mucosal erosions (oral, conjunctival, nasal, genital, anal, oesophageal, laryngopharyngeal).\n\nDiagnostic confirmation requires two skin biopsies, one for standard histological analysis and the other for direct immunofluorescence examination.\n\nHistological analysis makes it possible to distinguish where the bulla forms in the skin (intraepidermally or subepidermally) but does not specify the mechanism of bulla formation.\n\n''''' A positive direct immunofluorescence test, which reveals the presence of autoantibodies within the lesions, confirms the autoimmune nature of bullous dermatosis. If the direct immunofluorescence test is negative, the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatosis is ruled out. '''''",
