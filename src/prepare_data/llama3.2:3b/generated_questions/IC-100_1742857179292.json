This is most often a primary headache. A distinction is made between\n\no '''Migraine (<u>item 99</u>)'''\n\n\u00a7 Migraine without aura\n\n\u00a7 Migraine with aura: progressive, successive and transient neurological disorders (< 1 hour) preceding or accompanying the headache at its onset, most often visual signs, sometimes sensory, rarely language disorders.\n\no '''Tension headache (<u>item 99</u>)''''\n\no '''Algie vasculaire de la face'''''(<u>item 99)</u>''' to be distinguished from trigeminal neuralgia\n\n- '''Chronic post-traumatic headache:''' Long-term QCC that persists >3 months after a head injury, follows acute post-traumatic headache (< 3 months), and may be accompanied by a post-traumatic syndrome (vertigo, sleep disorders, difficulty concentrating, mood disorder). Resembles a chronic migraine or chronic tension headache.\n\n\n- Chronic headache of cervical origin'': certain rheumatological conditions can cause headaches (severe osteoarthritis and/or disco-radicular conflict, sequelae of fracture/dislocation of a cervical vertebra, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.).
