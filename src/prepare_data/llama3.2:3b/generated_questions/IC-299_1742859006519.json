Other rarer histological subtypes exist:\n\n\n- '''Neurinoma or schwannoma''' :\n\no Development from Schwann cells of the cranial/peripheral nerves (with the exception of the olfactory nerve and the optic nerve, which are extensions of the central nervous system).\n\no Benin in the vast majority of cases\n\no Sporadic or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (phacomatosis)\n\no preferential location = vestibular nerve +++\n\no MRI: homogeneously enhanced tumour arising from the internal auditory canal (for vestibular schwannoma)\n\n\n- '''Ependymoma:'''\n\no Development from ventricular ependymocytes\n\no Intraventricular location, often supraventricular in adults (unlike children)\n\no Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults\n\no MRI: poly-lobulated morphology; intense enhancement after contrast injection\n\no Benign (WHO grade 1 or 2); more rarely malignant (WHO grade 3)\n\n- '''Medulloblastoma:'''\n\no Malignant embryonal tumour (WHO grade 4)\n\no Infra tentorial location = vermis of the cerebellum +++.\n\no Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults.\n\no MRI: heterogeneous enhancement after contrast injection\n\no Possible metastatic dissemination in the LCS \u2192 systematically injected panmedullary MRI +++.\n\n\n- '''Hemangioblastoma:'''\n\no Benign vascular tumour\n\no Sporadic or as part of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (phacomatosis)\n\no Preferential location in the cerebellum +++, or spinal cord\n\no MRI: mixed appearance, i.e. cystic/solid, with a strongly enhanced mural nodule after contrast injection\n\no Biology: rarely (but very suggestive of the diagnosis), presence of secondary polycythaemia (secretion of erythropoietic factor by the tumour).\n\n\n- '''Primary cerebral lymphoma:'''\n\no [[Malignant lymphoma|Lymphoma]] type B, diffuse, large cell\n\no Primitive = in the absence of any other systemic location\n\no Rare\n\no > 60 years\n\no Terrain: occurrence favoured by immunosuppression e.g. [[HIV: Know the elements of prevention through screening|HIV]], organ transplantation\n\no MRI: tumour frequently multifocal; periventricular location; \"flaky\" appearance, evenly enhanced after contrast injection",
