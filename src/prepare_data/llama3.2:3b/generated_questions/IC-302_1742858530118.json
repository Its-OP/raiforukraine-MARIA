These are the most common melanocytic lesions. These benign tumours are made up of melanocytes grouped together in clusters (theca) in the epidermis and/or dermis.\n* Congenital nevi present from birth. These are much rarer (1% of births). <br />\n\nThe clinical appearance of a common nevus can vary greatly (size, shape, pigmentation), but in a given individual, all the nevi usually have a comparable appearance.\n\n\nCongenital nevi vary greatly in size.  Progressively, their surface may become irregular with hypertrichosis. Large congenital nevi (defined as having a projected diameter of > 20 cm in adulthood) are rare. They may even be giant and extend over a large part of the body, with a tendency towards metameric distribution, most often dorsal.\n\n\nThe blue nevus is a deep dermal nevus with a high melanin load.\n\nAchromic nevi are unpigmented, usually tuberous and predominantly on the face or trunk.\n\n\n\nFactors responsible for the development of nevi :\n\n* Intrinsic factors: constitutional, genetic susceptibility\n** Correlation between number of nevi and ethnic origin (more nevi in Caucasian > Asian > black population)\n** Link between number of nevi and phototype (most common: phototype II)\n** Family predisposition: density of nevi in children correlated with that of parents\n* Extrinsic factors\n** Environmental, behavioural: correlation between number of nevi and sun exposure\n** Immunological status: Immunodepression \u00e8 Increase in the number of nevi",
