It is an undesirable event, the cause of which is a compliant and error-free care action. It is linked to the realisation of a risk inherent in the care provided. An example is the occurrence of a side effect of a correctly prescribed and administered medicine.  Therapeutic hazard is defined as a medical accident (an unforeseen event causing damage with a certain causal link to the medical act), an iatrogenic condition (the care provided to the patient caused the damage) or a nosocomial infection (the infection appears after hospitalisation and was absent on the day of admission) which occurred without any responsibility on the part of the healthcare professionals or the healthcare establishment. According to case law, the therapeutic hazard consists of \"the occurrence, through no fault of the practitioner, of an accidental risk inherent in the medical act and which could not be controlled\".  Any risk inherent in the act of treatment, diagnosis or prevention may constitute a therapeutic hazard.",
