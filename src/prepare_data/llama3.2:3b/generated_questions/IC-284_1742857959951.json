The patient must be informed beforehand of the benefits of the procedure and the risks involved (perforation, bleeding). In the case of a diarrhoeal subtype, it is recommended that staged biopsies be taken in all colonic segments to look for microscopic colitis, and in the ileum to rule out ileal Crohn's disease. An oesogastroduodenal endoscopy with biopsies to look for \"Helicobacter pylori\" and/or duodenal atrophy is also indicated in cases of associated dyspepsia or iron-deficiency anaemia.",
