In the case of a hydrocele, it confirms the diagnosis and reveals an effusion in the vagina surrounding the testicle (anechogenic collection). In adults, it is used to assess the condition of the underlying testicle in order to rule out a hydrocele as a reaction to orchi-epidydimitis or associated with a testicular tumour.\n*Percutaneous puncture is contraindicated.",
