While experimental studies can provide proof of causality, observational studies can only discuss the plausibility of this causality, in the light of the \"Bradford Hill causality criteria\":\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''BRADFORD HILL CAUSALITY CRITERIA''''\n|-\n|Criteria '''internal''' to the study\n|Statistical association between exposure and the phenomenon studied\n\nStrength of the association\n\nDose-effect relationship\n\nSpecificity of the relationship\n\nMinimisation of selection and ranking bias.

It is now accepted that an effect can be multi-causal (environment, genetic, etc.) and therefore the specificity of the relationship is no longer an essential causality criterion</small>\n\n\nThe different types of study therefore do not have the same demonstrative value in terms of causality, which translates into ''a different level of evidence'' (classification proposed by the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9, cf [[Argumenter les niveaux de preuve des principales sources d'information 2C-323-PE-A03]]):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Grade des recommandations''''\n|'''Level of scientific evidence provided by the literature'''\n|-\n|'''A Scientific evidence established'''\n|'''Level 1'''\n\n* high-powered randomised controlled trials\n* meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials\n* decision analysis based on well-conducted studies\n|-\n|'''B Scientific presumption'''\n|'''Level 2'''\n\n* low-power randomised controlled trials\n* well-conducted non-randomised comparative studies\n* cohort studies\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''C Low level of scientific evidence'''\n|'''Level 3'''\n\n* case-control studies.\n|-\n|'''Level 4'''\n\n* comparative studies with significant bias\n* retrospective studies\n* case series\n* descriptive epidemiological studies (cross-sectional, longitudinal)\n|}\n<br />",
