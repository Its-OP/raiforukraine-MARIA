A lesion is suspicious (figure e) when :\n\n- a pigmented lesion is different from the others: the \"ugly duckling\" theory.\n\n- a lesion has several of the following characteristics (ABCDE rule):\n\n               - '''A'''symmetry\n\n               - '''B'''ords irr\u00e9guliers\n\n               - '''C'''ouleur inhomog\u00e8ne\n\n               - '''D'''iameter \u00b3 6 mm\n\n               - '''E'''volutivity, i.e. a change in the lesion\n\nDermoscopy can help screen for melanoma (improving the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical examination).\n\n\nThe diagnosis, suspected clinically, is confirmed histologically after complete excision of the lesion. Biopsies are not taken.\n\nAnatomopathological examination confirms the diagnosis of melanoma and determines the essential histoprognostic criteria:\n\n* The Breslow index, which corresponds to the maximum thickness of the tumour and is the most relevant prognostic criterion.\n* Ulceration, which is a poor prognostic criterion.\n* Mitotic index (number of mitoses/mm<sup>2</sup>).",
