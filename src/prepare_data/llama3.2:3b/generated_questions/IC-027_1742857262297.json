Identification is used to determine whether the antibody in question is a risk factor for foetal or neonatal complications (anti-D in particular, but also anti-Kell, anti-c, etc.). Titration and weight assay are used to assess the affinity and quantity of the antibody.\n\n'''312. [[Prevention of foetal risks SD-312|Prevention of foetal risks]]''''",
