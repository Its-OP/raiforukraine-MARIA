By definition, all complementary tests are normal. It is a benign but chronic pathology with a significant deterioration in quality of life.\n\n\nThere are 4 subtypes of IBS, depending on the predominant transit.\n\n           - IBS with predominant diarrhoea (IBS-D),\n\n           - IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C)\n\n           - IBS with alternating diarrhoea and constipation (IBS-A)\n\n           - IBS indeterminate (IBS-I), for patients who do not fall into any of the 3 subgroups",
