Know that microscopic haematuria alone or associated with proteinuria may suggest NIgA in the first instance.\n|Rubric=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=Eric Daugas,Bruno Moulin\n|Order=12}}\n\n'''C.     IgA nephropathy''''\n\n'''Diagnosis'''\n\nAll glomerular syndromes are possible:\n\n* Recurrent macroscopic haematuria syndrome, without clots or pain, typically 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection;\n* Chronic glomerulonephritis syndrome;\n* Isolated microscopic haematuria;\n* Other possible presentations are :\n** impure nephrotic syndrome with haematuria and hypertension,\n** rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome.\n\n'''Diagnosis of NIgA is based on renal biopsy:'''\n\n* Mesangial deposits of IgA and C3.\n* mesangial cell proliferation, \u00b1 endocapillary, \u00b1 extracapillary\n\nEtiological diagnosis\n\n* Associated secondary NIgA :\n** cirrhosis,\n** chronic inflammatory bowel disease,\n** spondyloarthropathies,\n* IgA nephropathy in rheumatoid purpura:\n** Systemic vasculitis of small-calibre arteries with IgA\n** More common in children than adults.\n** Extra-renal signs: vascular purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, myalgia,\n** NIgA is sometimes severe with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome.\n** The most severe forms require high-dose corticosteroid therapy.\n\n'''In the absence of a cause:''' Primary IgA nephropathy or Berger's disease.",
