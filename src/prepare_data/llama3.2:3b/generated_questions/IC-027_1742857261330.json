It increases with gestational age (36% in the 1st trimester, 40% in the 2nd, 65% in the 3rd).\n\nAmong infected children, 10% will develop a severe prenatal infection (intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, intracranial calcifications, foetal death in utero) ''[[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|115. Anomaly of psychomotor development]]'', 10% are apparently healthy at birth but will have neurosensory sequelae (deafness in particular) and 80% will have an asymptomatic form. Maternal reinfections also expose the child to these risks, although less frequently.\n\nSeverity is correlated with term: lower risk of transmission at the beginning of pregnancy but more severe forms.\n\nIn the event of maternal infection, the patient should be referred to a prenatal diagnosis centre to discuss management (antiviral/amniocentesis/ultrasound +/6 MRI).\n\nThe use of high-dose valaciclovir could reduce the risk of congenital infection for infections in the 1st<sup>trimester</sup> of pregnancy when introduced rapidly.\n\nSystematic screening by [[Interpretation of an SD-236 serology result|maternal serology]] for this frequent infection during pregnancy is not currently recommended in France.",
