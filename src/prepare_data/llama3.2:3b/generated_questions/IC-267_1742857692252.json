    "question": "What is the typical sequence of electrocardiographic changes associated with hyperkalaemia?",
    "option_a": "Accelerated repolarisation with a decrease in the amplitude of the T waves, followed by atrial conduction abnormalities, then intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and finally bradycardia with wide QRS.",
    "option_b": "Accelerated repolarisation with an increase in the amplitude of the T waves, followed by atrial conduction abnormalities, then intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and finally bradycardia with wide QRS.",
    "option_c": "Accelerated repolarisation with an increase in the amplitude of the T waves, followed by atrial conduction abnormalities, then intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and finally ventricular arrhythmias.",
    "option_d": "Accelerated repolarisation with an increase in the amplitude of the T waves, followed by atrial conduction abnormalities, then intraventricular conduction abnormalities, and finally bradycardia with wide QRS and ventricular arrhythmias.",
