''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|111. Genital bleeding during pregnancy)]''' +/- any accompanying signs :\n\n- permanent uterine pain, EC, loss of amniotic fluid\n\n- palpation of the uterus (soft or contracted), uterine height, abnormal presentation (transverse)\n\n- speculum to rule out a cervical cause\n\n- urine dipstick to check for proteinuria.\n\n3. cardiotocographic recording (RCF) and tocometry.\n\nobstetric ultrasound (foetal vitality, position of placenta, HRP very rarely visible and therefore informative, EPF, amniotic fluid). Caution: ultrasound should not delay treatment in cases of suspected HRP++.\n\n4. Biological work-up: CBC, PT, APTT, more complete haemostasis work-up depending on the extent of the bleeding and the diagnosis.\n\n\n'''In favour of placenta previa (PP)'''\n\nThe clinical signs in favour are :\n\nabundant haemorrhage (red blood, often recurrent) +/- uterine contractions, but without permanent uterine pain (Cf. ''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|111. Genital bleeding during pregnancy]])''''\n\na flexible, pain-free uterus\n\nfrequent pathological presentation (breech or transverse)\n\nwell-perceived foetal cardiac activity\n\nUltrasound :\n\nlow placenta inserted close to the internal orifice of the uterine cervix (< 50 mm) or covering the uterine cervix\n\n\n'''In favour of a retroplacental haematoma (HRP)'''\n\nThe clinical signs in favour are:\n\nvascular context (>35 years, hypertension, smoking, cocaine, primipara, pre-eclampsia)\n\nslight, blackish, incoagulable haemorrhage + sudden, permanent uterine pain, which dominates the picture\n\nsevere maternal repercussions unrelated to the extent of haemorrhage\n\npermanent, painful uterine contracture (\"wooden belly\");\n\nnon-perceived foetal cardiac activity (dead foetus) in complete forms.",
