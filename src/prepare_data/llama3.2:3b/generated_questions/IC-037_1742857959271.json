The dose is 400 to 600 mg, to be repeated if necessary, without exceeding 1,200 mg/24 h. Paracetamol + codeine may be an alternative. Paracetamol alone and phloroglucinol are not recommended. The duration of treatment may vary from a few hours to a few days.\n\nFor the instrumental method, NSAIDs are recommended to limit intraoperative and postoperative pain. A dose of 600 mg ibuprofen can be administered pre-operatively.\n\n'''[[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]. [Prescribing analgesics SD-250|Prescribing analgesics. [[Prevention of pain associated with care SD-258|Prevention of pain associated with care]]. [Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|Assessment and management of acute pain]].''''\n\n===Failure===\nComplete failure is defined by a progressive pregnancy. The risk of complete failure in the case of instrumental abortion is exceptional (1 to 5 \u2030). The rate of progressive pregnancy after medical abortion is 1%.\n\nPartial failure is defined as an incomplete abortion. It is more frequent in the case of medical abortion. Two solutions may then be proposed:\n\n- instrumental suction\n\n- misoprostol per os\n\n===Mechanics===\nSpecific to the instrumental method :\n\ncervical tears in 0.2 to 1% of cases\n\nuterine perforation: 1 to 4 per 1000 operations\n\n===Haemorrhage===\nThe risk of haemorrhage after an abortion is 1%, with a transfusion risk of 0.1%. This risk is greater in the case of medically induced abortion.\n\n'''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|Genital bleeding during pregnancy]]. [Acute haemorrhage SD-060|Acute haemorrhage]]. [Palpitation SD-165|Palpitation]]. [[Tachycardia SD-166|Tachycardia]].''''\n\n===Infectious infections===\nThe risk of upper genital infection is around 1% after an instrumental abortion and 0.3% after a medicated abortion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only in the case of instrumental abortion. Particular attention should be paid to the clinical inflammatory syndrome after abortion, whatever the technique, so as not to overlook a type A Streptococcus pyogenes infection.\n\n===Deaths===\nThe risk of death due to abortion is of the same order as that due to spontaneous miscarriage (0.7 per 100,000).\n\n==Secondary complications ==\nThese are uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM). The persistence of ovarian tissue after a medicated or instrumental abortion can lead to a failure to resorb the peritrophoblastic vascularisation and the creation of a UAVM. The treatment for these complications is embolisation by interventional radiology in the event of haemorrhage.\n\n==''Long-term complications'''==\nAfter one or more abortions, there is no increased risk of :\n\ninfertility\n\nSCC, except where the interval between the abortion and the subsequent pregnancy is < 3 months\n\nof EP\n\nplacental anomalies\n\npremature delivery\n\nan increase in psychiatric disorders\n\nadenomyosis\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Complications'''\n|'''Medical abortion'''\n|'''Instrumental abortion'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |'''Immediate'''\n|Pain\n|Failure\n|-\n|Failure\n|Mechanical\n|-\n|Hemorrhagic\n|Hemorrhagic\n|-\n|Infectious\n|Infections\n|-\n|Deaths\n|Deaths\n|-\n|\n|Uterine perforation\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Secondary''''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Arteriovenous Malformation\n\nUterine (MAVU)\n|MAVU\n|-\n|Synechia\n|}\nSummary table of the main complications of abortion",
