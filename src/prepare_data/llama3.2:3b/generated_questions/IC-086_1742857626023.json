It should raise the possibility of an intracranial retrocarotid aneurysm (originating in the posterior communicating artery) which may compress the III in its subarachnoid course. This aetiology is all the more likely to be evoked if there are headaches suggestive of [[Meningeal haemorrhage|subarachnoid (or meningeal) haemorrhage]].\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\nClaude Bernard-Horner syndrome is secondary to damage to the sympathetic system along its entire course:\n\n*Cerebral trunk, especially [[Know the localizing value of an alternating sensory syndrome and cite an example OIC-092-04-B|Wallenberg syndrome]]\n*cervical spinal cord\n*pulmonary plexus ([[Know how to evoke the diagnosis of plexopathy OIC-095-03-A|Pancoast-Tobias syndrome]])\n*cervical ([[List the arguments for the diagnosis of dissection of an artery destined for the brain OIC-340-06-B|dissection of an artery destined for the brain]])\n\nIt combines :\n\n*a \"reduction in the palpebral slit\" without true ptosis, due to paralysis of the superior tarsal muscle, innervated by the sympathetic system,\n*miosis due to lack of innervation of the pupil dilator muscle, which is innervated by the sympathetic system,\n*enophthalmos\" due to reduced tone of the orbital muscles.",
