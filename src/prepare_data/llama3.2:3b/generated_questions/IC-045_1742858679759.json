The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.\n\n- If the risk is greater than or equal to 1/50, a foetal karyotype is proposed straight away. However, the woman may ask to undergo an INFP.\n\n\nIf it has not been possible to carry out screening in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it is possible to propose the measurement of serum markers in the 2nd trimester (hCG, alpha-feto-protein, oestriol).",
