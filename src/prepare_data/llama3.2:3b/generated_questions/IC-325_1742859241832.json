These products can be just as dangerous or even fatal as fake medicines containing poisons or unauthorised products.\n\nExample: in 2012, in the United States, an anti-cancer drug Avastin\u00ae containing no active ingredients was found in 19 doctors' surgeries.\n\n====Insufficient quantity of active ingredient====\nUnderdosed, the drug cannot be effective.\n\nLong-term use of an under-dosed counterfeit product can also lead to drug resistance, particularly in the case of antibiotics or antiparasitic drugs (anti-malaria, anti-HIV or anti-tuberculosis treatments). This resistance, acquired during long-term use, can prevent the effectiveness of therapies against disease, creating an additional risk for public health.\n\nIn 2009, in Tanzania, a Metakelfin\u00ae antimalarial treatment containing insufficient active ingredient was discovered in 40 pharmacies across the country.\n\n====Excessive quantity of active ingredient====\nIn such cases, there is a risk that the patient will overdose and suffer adverse effects.\n\nExample: in 2009, in China, hypoglycaemic drugs containing 6 times the normal dose of glibenclamide led to the death of 2 patients and 9 others were hospitalised.\n\n=Risks associated with the composition of counterfeit products=\nIn some cases, the ''active ingredient'' may be ''replaced'' by corn starch, potato starch or saline solution.\n\nSometimes it is the presence of ''toxic substances'' that is found, which can be very serious for the patient, even leading to death. These are described below.\n\n#Heavy metals: mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminium, etc.: these products are carcinogenic and toxic to the central nervous system, kidneys and liver.\n#Real poisons\": rat poison, boric acid, antifreeze, etc.: \"toxic\" to the kidneys, causing kidney failure and developmental abnormalities. ''Example'': in Haiti (1995) and India (1998), a cough syrup containing paracetamol was prepared with diethylene glycol (a toxic chemical used as antifreeze) and caused a total of 89 deaths in both countries.\n#Common household products'': brick dust, chalk, paints, floor wax, etc.: used to improve the appearance of counterfeit medicines, they cause a wide range of adverse effects, from vomiting and dizziness to coma and even death.\n#Other and unwanted active ingredients'': silbutramine, haloperidol, etc.: all carry risks of varying degrees depending on their activity and dosage, such as breathing difficulties, muscle spasms, high blood pressure, strokes, etc. ''Example'': between 2000 and 2003, in the United States, aspirin was substituted for tablets of a neuroleptic (Zyprexa\u00ae).\n\n<br />",
