Route of administration :\n\n*per os whenever possible\n*or intramuscularly.\n\nRecommended treatments for agitation: in psychotic and bipolar disorders, a \"per os\" antipsychotic treatment if possible (\"olanzapine\", \"aripiprazole\", \"levomepromazine\") or intramuscular (\"olanzapine\", \"aripiprazole\" and \"levomepromazine\").\n\nCyamemazine carries a risk of arterial hypotension.\n\nThe \"pre-therapeutic assessment\" is based on the ECG whenever possible. In the case of major states of agitation, the ECG should be taken after administration, and the reasons for this should be recorded in the medical record.",
