This is most often the ability to show a difference if it exists (in a randomised superiority trial), or an association if it exists (in a cohort or case-control study). More rarely, power may be the ability to show an absence of difference (non-inferiority trial or equivalence trial).\n\nThe power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Parameter'''\n|'''Influence on power''''\n|-\n|Size of sample analysed N\n|If N increases, power increases\n|-\n|Difference to be detected d\n|If d increases, power increases\n|-\n|Variability of observations (variance)\n|If variance increases, power decreases\n|-\n|Alpha risk\n|If alpha increases, power increases\n|-\n|One-tailed or two-tailed test\n|If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.\n|}\nIn practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).",
