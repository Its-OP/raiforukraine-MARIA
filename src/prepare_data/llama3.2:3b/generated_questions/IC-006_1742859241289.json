As in aviation, it encourages the \"sharing of information\" by \"cross-checking\", in particular the identity of the patient, the type of operation and the surgical site, the equipment and the risks involved. Other checklists exist in the medical world for so-called \"interventional\" activities (endoscopy, interventional radiology, central venous catheters, chemotherapy, etc.).                              \n\nFigure 3 : Checklist for patient safety in the operating theatre - 2018 version Source HAS\n[[File:Item6 Fig3.png|centric|thumb|812x812px]]\n<br />",
