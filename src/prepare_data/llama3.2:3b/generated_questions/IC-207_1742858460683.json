If the prognosis is life-threatening, a chest CT scan with injection is generally indicated as the first line of defence.\n\nThe main \"non-indications\" for emergency chest radiography are :\n\n* Suspicion of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism or oesophageal rupture, thoracic trauma or polytrauma: CT scan with injection as first-line treatment.\n* Suspected myocardial infarction: ECG, coronary angiography.\n* Upper airway infection, unequivocal and uncomplicated bronchiolitis in children: no imaging.\n\nChest CT scans in low-dose or ultra-low-dose mode are now being used more and more frequently in emergency departments, as a complement to or replacement for chest X-rays. Profile radiography is used less and less.",
