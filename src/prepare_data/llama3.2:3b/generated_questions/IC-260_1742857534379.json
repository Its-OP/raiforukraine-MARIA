Haemostasis disorders must be corrected at the same time (discontinuation of an anti-coagulant, correction of an overdose, vitamin K or PPSB supplementation, etc.).\n\n*In case of urine retention due to bladder clotting:\n**Placement of a suprapubic catheter (KT) is contraindicated: risk of dissemination in case of unrecognised underlying bladder urothelial tumour, and impossibility of unblocking and continuous bladder cleansing with risk of obstruction of the KT (insufficient calibre).\n**Placement of a double-stream bladder catheter (large bore CH>18): manual decapping with a syringe followed by continuous irrigation/washing with physiological saline. An ECBU is performed when the catheter is inserted.\n\n*If manual decalcification fails, if the transfusion yield is poor or if the patient is clinically unwell, endoscopic surgical decalcification should be considered in the operating theatre; this may allow a bladder lesion to be treated/resected at the same time.\n\n*In cases of macroscopic haematuria originating in the upper excretory tract, clotting may lead to renal colic, which is usually self-limiting. It may sometimes be necessary to insert a ureteral stent in cases of obstructive pyelonephritis, renal failure or resistant renal pain.",

    "question": "In the management of clotting haematuria, what is the recommended approach for urine retention due to bladder clotting?",
    "option_a": "Placement of a suprapubic catheter (KT) is recommended to allow continuous bladder cleansing and prevent obstruction.",
    "option_b": "Placement of a double-stream bladder catheter (large bore CH>18) is recommended to facilitate manual decapping and irrigation.",
    "option_c": "Manual decapping with a syringe followed by continuous irrigation/washing with physiological saline is the preferred method.",
    "option_d": "Endoscopic surgical decalcification should be considered if manual decapping fails or if the patient is clinically unwell."
