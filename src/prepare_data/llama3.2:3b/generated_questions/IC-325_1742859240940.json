In the absence of consolidation of the victim's state of health before his or her death, the starting point for the limitation period is the date of the victim's death.\n\n=====Step 2: assessment of the application by the ICC=====\nFrom the date of receipt of a complete file, the ICC has 6 months to give its opinion on the circumstances, causes, nature and extent of the damage suffered by the victim and on the applicable compensation scheme.  \n\nThe ICC's assessment of cases is based on \"expert opinions\". These expert reports are requested by the Chairman of the CCI from medical experts in the discipline involved in the case under review, who are on the list of experts.\n\n=====Step 3: compensation offer=====\nThe \"Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M\u00e9dicaux, des Affections Iatrog\u00e8nes et des Infections Nosocomiales'' (ONIAM) or the insurer of the healthcare provider in question (depending on whether it concerns a therapeutic hazard or a fault) has a ''period of 4 months'' from receipt of the notice to make an ''offer of compensation'' to the victim and a period of 1 month to pay if the victim accepts the offer.\n\n=====Optional step=====\nIf the insurer refuses or remains silent after the 4-month period, the victim may \"ask ONIAM to take the place of the insurer\". The ONIAM then has a \"period of 4 months\" from receipt of a valid request to inform the victim of its position and make a proposal for compensation. ONIAM can then take action against the insurer. <br />",
