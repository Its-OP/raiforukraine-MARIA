(Risk-benefit ratio)\n\n- No radiological diagnostic examination exceeds a dose of 100mGy.  A dose of less than 100 mGy has no harmful effect and does not justify termination of pregnancy.  \n\n- Usual examinations not reaching the value of 100 mGy: chest X-ray (max <0.01), abdomen (max: 4.2 mGy) films taken on an upper/lower limb, a thoracic angio-scanner. For the abdomino-pelvic scanner, the average dose is 8 mGy and the maximum dose is 49 mGy. The patient should be kept informed.\n\n- The risk of childhood cancer following foetal irradiation has not been demonstrated at the doses used in diagnostic imaging.\n\n==MRI==\n- MRI can be carried out on pregnant women, but it is advisable to avoid the first trimester of pregnancy and to limit injections of contrast products, including when breast-feeding.
