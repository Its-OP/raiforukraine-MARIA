It is also called early bacterial neonatal infection if bacterial.\n\nDepending on the agent responsible and the stage of the pregnancy, MFIs can lead to :\n\n- Miscarriages\n\n- Embryopathies\n\n- Foetal infections = foetopathies\n\n- In utero or neonatal death\n\n- Post-natal infections which may be symptomatic from the 1st day, or at a later date",
