[Dehydration in children SD-032|Acute dehydration]]: frequent in the oldest age groups, or if patients have been exposed to multiple medications (on diuretics), it depends on the frequency of bowel movements, the mechanism (more frequent if secretory), and the presence of vomiting which hinders rehydration.\n\n2. [Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|Sepsis: see item 157\n\n3. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\n\nComplications of Shigella spp or enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infections due to the production of shiga-toxins. More common in children than in adults, to be suspected in the presence of pallor (haemolytic anaemia with schizocytes), purpura, haematuria, organic renal failure (1st cause of acute renal failure - Anuria|IRA]] before the age of 3 - see item 348), localised or diffuse oedema (absence of weight loss despite diarrhoea = caution!), hypertension, anuria or oliguria. This syndrome occurs secondarily to diarrhoea, so it is important to look for it. Suspicion of HUS warrants an urgent nephrological or nephropaediatric opinion.\n\n4. Post-diarrhoea pseudo-occlusive picture: contributing factors = use of loperamide, hypokalaemia, colitis, etc.\n\n5. Febrile diarrhoea on returning from a trip: think of [[malaria]] and look for it (item 170)\n\n'''Hospitalisation criteria''': age < 3 months, weight loss \u226510% in children or 8% in adults, incoercible vomiting, sepsis (haemodynamic dysfunction: tachycardia in children, hypoTA in adults, hypoperfusion) and/or neurological (drowsiness, irritability, confusion) and/or polypnoea, occlusive syndrome, decompensated co-morbidity, underlying malnutrition, febrile diarrhoea on return from a malaria-endemic country social (ability to monitor at home, to reconsult in emergency)",
