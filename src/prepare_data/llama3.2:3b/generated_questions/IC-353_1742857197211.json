This safety plan is a list of resources (resource persons, emergency telephone number, calming activities, reassurance techniques, etc.) that the patient can use before and during a suicidal crisis.\n\nInvolving parents in the care process is essential; they need to be made aware of the need for a safe environment (limiting access to lethal means).",
