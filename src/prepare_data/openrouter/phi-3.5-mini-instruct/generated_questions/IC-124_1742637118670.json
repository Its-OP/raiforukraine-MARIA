To prevent endometrial hyperplasia, the progestogen sequence should not be less than 12 days per treatment cycle. Depending on whether the progestin is administered sequentially or continuously, a distinction is made between treatment regimens known as \"with menstruation\" and those known as \"without menstruation\".\n[File:THM.jpg|thumbnail]]\n<br />",
