In some cases, the scintillating scotoma is isolated, with no headache.\n\nThe stimuli most often reported are a bilateral scintillating scotoma, accompanied by coloured flashes, progressively extending to one visual hemifield. However, some patients report a wide variety of visual stimuli. The diagnosis is confirmed by repetition, a normal clinical examination and any associated headache.",
