It shows diffuse endocapillary proliferation with an influx of inflammatory cells. In severe forms, extracapillary proliferation is associated. Immunofluorescence shows deposits of C3 in the mesangium and in the wall of the glomerular capillaries (so-called starry sky deposits). Sometimes \"humps\" (large extramembranous deposits) are seen under the light microscope.",
