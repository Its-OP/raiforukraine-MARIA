In addition, total social protection expenditure other than benefits (\u20ac59 billion) has risen very sharply (+24.6% compared with -2.0% in 2019). This non-benefits item includes in particular additional expenditure linked to the health crisis, amounting to \u20ac11 billion, such as the purchase of masks and equipment linked to the health crisis or financial aid granted to healthcare professionals due to their reduced activity during the confinements.\n\n\nThe two main social risks accounting for the largest financial burden remain old age (43%) and health (33%) of social protection expenditure (Chart 1). The growth in social protection expenditure is linked in particular to employment support measures as a result of the introduction of short-time working.\n\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:19-G1 social benefits.png\n</gallery>\n\n\nOld-age and survivors' benefits have slowed down since the introduction of four major reforms to the pension system in 1993, 2003, 2008 and 2010: 1) indexation of pensions to inflation rather than wages, 2) calculation of pensions based on the best 25 years instead of the best 10 in the private sector, 3) increase in the number of years needed to qualify for the full rate, 4) increase in the legal age for entitlement from 60 to 62.\n\n\n'''However, the average amount of pensions is inevitably increasing'' in social protection for several reasons:\n\n1) the rise in real wages over the generations, 2) the retirement of baby-boomers, who outnumber current generations, and 3) longer life expectancy.\n\n\nAs far as health risk is concerned, the rate of increase in expenditure has been slowed since the 1980s by a number of reform plans: 1) 1982-1983 (reduction in the reimbursement of certain drugs, etc.), 2) 1986 and 1993, which increased the proportion of expenditure to be borne by households, 3) 1996, with the introduction of the national target for health insurance expenditure (Ondam), which aims to control expenditure by basic schemes. This target was regularly exceeded until 2009, but the 2004 Health Act and the ongoing strengthening of its control and monitoring mechanisms have ensured that it has been respected since 2010.\n\nHowever, health insurance benefits in France will increase by 4.3% (after +2.4% in 2019) to \u20ac228 billion.\n\nThis increase can be explained by :\n\n- by increases in the provision of care in the hospital sector and, to a lesser extent, in outpatient care. Despite an overall fall in the volume of care outside covid-19-related care, public hospital expenditure has increased due to higher remuneration (Covid-19 bonuses, S\u00e9gur de la sant\u00e9 measures) and the additional costs of caring for patients with Covid-19. Outpatient treatment is also increasing, despite the drop in consultations with GPs and specialists due to the epidemic, but there has been a spectacular rise in laboratory procedures (Covid-19 screening tests). Lastly, daily benefits (IJ) increased by 24.4% in 2020 for two reasons. Firstly, the so-called \"derogatory\" IJs were used to compensate people who had to stop working during the initial confinement (parents without childcare, vulnerable people, self-employed workers). On the other hand, sick pay also increased, due to sick leave linked to the epidemic waves. Medical and social benefits (health and disability) will also increase in 2020. As in the hospital sector, this increase is primarily the result of pay rises for employees working in the facilities, as well as additional funding paid out to deal with the health crisis. Disability benefits will increase by 3.6% (after 3.3% in 2019), due to the automatic extension of entitlement to disability compensation benefits. On the other hand, benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases will fall in 2020 as a result of the fall in the number of accidents at work, which in turn is due to the reduction in professional activities and the massive use of teleworking during the pandemic.",
