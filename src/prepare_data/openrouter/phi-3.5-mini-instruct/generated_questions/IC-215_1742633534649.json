      "option_a": "Both conditions are characterized by infiltrated and necrotic lesions.",
      "option_b": "Vascular purpura due to capillary fragility often involves areas of friction and may show mucosal involvement.",
      "option_c": "Thrombocytopenic purpura is typically non-infiltrated, non-necrotic, and may present with mucosal damage such as gingivorrhagia.",
      "option_d": "Thrombocytopenic purpura is usually aggravated by orthostatism and does not involve mucosal areas.",
