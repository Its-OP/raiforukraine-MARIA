In the case of AD this is :\n\n- '''the accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2-42) in extracellular deposits'' forming \"amyloid plaques\" or \"senile plaques\". A peptide is a protein fragment: in this case, the parent protein is APP (''Amyloid Precursor Protein''). The plaques are mainly present in the associative cerebral cortices (prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortices) and relatively spare the primary visual cortex (occipital lobes) and the motor cortex (precentral gyrus).\n\n- ''abnormal accumulation in the body and neuronal extensions of abnormally phosphorylated TAU protein forming neurofibrillary degeneration'' (NFD); these NFDs are found in large quantities in the medial temporal regions (particularly the hippocampi).\n\n- loss of neurons affected by TDR. When this cell loss is massive, it leads to atrophy of the affected regions.\n\nKnowledge of these elements of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology enables an understanding of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers (''[[Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SD-183|analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]]''' and MRI semiology (cf. item 343 Know the indications and objectives of imaging in the presence of dementia or confusion; cf. item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease).",
