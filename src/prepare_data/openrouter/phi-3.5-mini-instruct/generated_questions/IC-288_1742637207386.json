Only symptomatic haemorrhoids should be treated''. It is therefore the symptoms and the patient's request for treatment that should dictate the therapist's attitude. The four rules of the therapeutic preamble can therefore be stated as follows:\n\n- Treatment of haemorrhoids should be reserved for symptomatic forms.\n\n- In most cases, haemorrhoid treatment is a comfort treatment.\n\n- Medicinal treatments are usually reserved for acute symptoms and offered as a short course of treatment.\n\n- Instrumental and surgical procedures, on the other hand, constitute the basic treatment for internal haemorrhoidal disease and are reserved for specialist care.",
