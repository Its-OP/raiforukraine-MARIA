On the healthy contralateral eye, they may show a lengthening of latency times, reflecting a slowing of conduction suggestive of demyelination lesions.\n\nThe risk of developing multiple sclerosis after an isolated episode of optic neuropathy is 30% on average at 5 years. The main risk factors are :\n\n*the presence of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of the first examination\n*intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.\n\n==Toxic and metabolic optic neuropathies ==\nWhat these neuropathies have in common is that they are manifested by bilateral and progressive damage.\n\nThey are dominated by four causes:\n\n*Alcohol-induced optic neuropathy: favoured by associated smoking, and is often referred to as alcohol-induced optic neuropathy. It typically presents on examination of the visual field with a bilateral cecocentral scotoma. In the absence of withdrawal, it leads to the development of optic atrophy.\n\n*drug-induced optic neuropathy: observed mainly during treatment for tuberculosis (ethambutol and isoniazid). They can cause a permanent reduction in visual acuity, hence the need for regular systematic monitoring of patients treated by examination of the visual field and above all colour vision, as these optic neuropathies are revealed early by red-green dyschromatopsia.\n*occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead);\n*metabolic optic neuropathies: in particular diabetes.\n\n=='''Tumoral optic neuropathies'''==\nThese are:\n\n*intraorbital tumours of any kind: tumours of the optic nerve (glioma) or its sheaths (meningioma), compression of the optic nerve by an intraorbital tumour. They most often result in optic atrophy associated with exophthalmos.\n*tumours of the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n==Papilloedema ==\nThe papilla is hyperhaemic, with blurred edges.\n\n- Unilateral papilledema, with reduced visual acuity, suggests a vascular cause, particularly if associated with flare haemorrhages.\n\n- Bilateral papilledema with no loss of visual acuity suggests intracranial hypertension or severe arterial hypertension.",
