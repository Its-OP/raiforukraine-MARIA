It mainly affects the lower limbs.\n\n== '''Varicose vein''' ==\nPermanent dilatation of one or more superficial veins of the lower limbs of more than 3 mm in diameter in orthostatism, most often associated with reflux due to valvular incontinence (reflux leads to stasis of venous blood in the feet).\n\n== Clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological aspects of CVI ==\nThe clinical, aetiological, anatomical and pathophysiological elements of CVI are integrated into the CEAP international classification used routinely in the assessment of CVI. It allows us to speak the same language and includes clinical signs (C), etiology (E), anatomy (A) and pathophysiology (P). It is used here to show you how to apply the data taught, but you do not have to learn it.",

      "option_a": "CVI is the temporary enlargement of deep veins in the limbs, often associated with reflux due to valvular incompetence.",
      "option_b": "Varicose veins are dilatations of superficial veins less than 3 mm in diameter, typically without reflux.",
      "option_c": "CVI refers to the permanent dysfunction of the deep and/or superficial venous system, often due to valvular incompetence, which mainly affects the lower limbs.",
      "option_d": "Varicose veins are a type of arterial blockage that leads to reduced blood flow in the upper limbs.",
