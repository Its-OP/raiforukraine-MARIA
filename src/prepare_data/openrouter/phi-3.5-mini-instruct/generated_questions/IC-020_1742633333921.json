There may be several research objectives, but they must then be divided into a hierarchy of primary objective (unique, clear, precise, consensual, reasonable) and secondary objective(s) (cf. [[Health research methodology]]).\n\nThe definition of research hypotheses is directly linked to the estimation of the power of a study and the calculation of the number of subjects required (see [[Factors likely to influence the power of a study 2C-020-DE-A10]] and [[Calculation of the number of subjects required 2C-020-DE-A11]]). The hypothesis must then describe what is expected in terms of effect size.",
