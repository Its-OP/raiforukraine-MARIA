The main results of this ENEIS study (<nowiki>https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2020-10/er398-3.pdf</nowiki>) are as follows:\n\n* 3 to 5% of medical and surgical admissions were due to a serious adverse event.\n* Approximately 50% of serious adverse events leading to hospitalisation were associated with healthcare products, half of which were avoidable.\n* The observed incidence of serious adverse events during hospitalisation in medicine or surgery is around 7%.\n* 2 out of 5 serious adverse events occurring during hospitalisation are considered to be avoidable.\n* In 2 out of 5 cases, serious adverse events occurring during hospitalisation lead to prolonged hospitalisation.",
