However, it is important to be wary of pollakiuria, which is a frequent symptom in the absence of any pathology, particularly in the 3rd trimester.\n*An ECBU with antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended.\n*Diagnosis is made if leucocyturia \u2265 10<sup>4</sup>/mL and bacteriuria \u2265 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for ''E. coli'' or ''Staphylococcus saprophyticus'' and \u2265 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL for other enterobacteria, enterococci, ''Corynebacterium urealyticum'', P. ''aeruginosa'' and ''S. aureus''.\n*\n*Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the antibiogram result.\n\n\n2-Treatment (cf CEGO Acute gravidic cystitis (treatment) [[Acute gravidic cystitis (treatment) 2C-028-PC-A02|2C-028-PC-A02]])\n\n*Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the results of the antibiogram.\n*Current recommendations for antibiotic treatment are (molecules in order of prescription preference):\n**Bosfomycin-Trometamol in 1 dose\n**Pivmecillinam for 7 days\n**\n**A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU until delivery.\n\n\n3-Urinary colonisation in pregnant women\n\nUrinary colonisation (\u2265 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) in a pregnant woman must be treated. Treatment adapted to the results of the antibiogram must be started as soon as the results are received (no probabilistic treatment). Treatment with amoxicillin for 7 days is the first-line antibiotic. A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU, is recommended until delivery.\n\n\nACUTE GRAVID B-PYELONEPHRITIS (cf CEGO item 2C-028 [[2C-028]])\n\n1-Acute gravid pyelonephritis (clinical) [[Acute gravid pyelonephritis (clinical) 2C-028-DP-A03|2C-028-DP-A03]]\n\n2-Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (biological diagnosis) [[Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (biological diagnosis) 2C-028-DP-A04|2C-028-DP-A04]]\n\n3-Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (treatment) [[Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (treatment) 2C-028-PC-B01|2C-028-PC-B01]]\n\n\nNB: it is not necessary to know the dosage of antibiotics.\n\n<br />",
