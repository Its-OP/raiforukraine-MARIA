Diagnostic features of encephalic death are based on:===\n\n*clinical criteria:\n**Total absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity;\n**Abolition of all brainstem reflexes;\n**Total absence of spontaneous ventilation verified by a hypercapnia test.\n*and paraclinical criteria:\n**2 null and reactive electroencephalograms for 30 minutes performed 4 hours apart;\n**or cerebral angiography showing cessation of encephalic circulation.\n\n<br />\n\n===B.    The donor with a stopped heart===\nFrench law authorises donation \"from a deceased person in persistent cardiac and respiratory arrest\". These are known as deceased donors after circulatory arrest (DDAC).\n\nA distinction is made between :\n\n*donors who have suffered an \"uncontrolled\" out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;\n*donors who have suffered circulatory arrest in intensive care following a decision to stop active treatment.\n\n\nOnce proof of death has been obtained by recording an electrocardiogram lasting 5 minutes without QRS complexes or with agonic complexes < 5 per minute, a death report is drawn up, enabling the National Refusal Register (RNR) to be queried immediately, which is compulsory before any organ retrieval procedure can begin.",

    "question": "What are the diagnostic criteria for encephalic death according to French law for organ donation after circulatory arrest (DDAC)?",
    "option_a": "Total absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity, abolition of all brainstem reflexes, and total absence of spontaneous ventilation verified by a hypercapnia test.",
    "option_b": "Presence of a stable heart rate and spontaneous breathing, along with positive electroencephalogram readings.",
    "option_c": "Sudden onset of cardiac arrest in a hospital setting, with immediate resuscitation efforts.",
