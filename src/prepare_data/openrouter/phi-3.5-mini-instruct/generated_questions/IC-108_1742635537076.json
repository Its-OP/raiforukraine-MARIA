Attention is the \"gateway\" to cognition; an alteration in attention leads to a major and global disorganisation of coherent thought.\n\nThe confusional syndrome is determined by risk factors and by a triggering factor (cause of the confusion), which may be neurological or non-neurological. The triggering factor may be minimal (e.g. urinary tract infection) in a subject with risk factors. The main risk factors are :\n\n- neurosensory disorders (''''[[Vision abnormality SD-138|vision abnormality]]; [[Decreased hearing/deafness SDD-140|decreased hearing/deafness]]'''')\n\n- chronic psychiatric pathologies ('''[[Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression) SDD-269|Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression)]]; [[Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a depressive patient SDD-288|Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a depressive patient]]''')\n\n- consumption of alcohol and psychotropic drugs '''([[Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313|prevention of alcohol-related risks]])''''\n\n- immobilisation (hospitalisation, intensive care, post-operative recovery phase) (management of a patient in prolonged decubitus)\n\n- pre-existing chronic pathology (''''[[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-266|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-267|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SDD-279|follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a geriatric patient SD-295|follow-up consultation for a geriatric patient]]''')\n\n- underlying neurocognitive disorder +++: it is justified to reassess the cognitive status of patients at a distance (6 months) from the confusional episode '''([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]; [[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])''''",
