It is intermittent and occurs in fits and starts. It is often aggravated by episodes of stress or anxiety and subsides during periods of rest, such as holidays. The pain is linked to transit (improvement or worsening after defecation).\n\nAbdominal bloating and a subjective feeling of fullness or abdominal discomfort are very often associated.\n\n           The second key symptom of the disease is transit disorders. This may be constipation, clinically defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, hard stools or difficulty in evacuating. There may be diarrhoea, defined as frequent stools, i.e. at least 3 a day (often postprandial, soft to liquid). These bowel movements may be urgent, and some patients develop toilet-seeking syndrome (locating available toilets in anticipation of a journey), or alternating diarrhoea and constipation.\n\n\n           IBS is often associated with other functional symptoms. These include functional dyspepsia with the presence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (early satiety, pyrosis, epigastric heaviness), fibromyalgia (diffuse myalgias and arthralgias with no organic substrate) and chronic fatigue syndrome.",
