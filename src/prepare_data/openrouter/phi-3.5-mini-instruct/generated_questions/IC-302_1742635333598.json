The choice of margins is dictated by the Breslow index. The following margins are recommended:\n\n- for intraepidermal melanomas: 0.5 cm margins;\n\n- if the Breslow index is less than or equal to 1 mm: margins of 1 cm ;\n\n- if the Breslow index is between 1.01 and 2 mm: margins of 1 to 2 cm;\n\n- if the Breslow index is greater than 2 mm: 2 cm margins;\n\nFor non-invasive Dubreuilh's melanoma, a margin of 1 cm is recommended.\n\n\n\nHow to prevent melanoma",
