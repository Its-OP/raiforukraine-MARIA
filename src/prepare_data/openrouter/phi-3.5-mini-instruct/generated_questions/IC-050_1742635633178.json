Spermatic cord torsion is rare after the age of 40.\n*It causes irreversible arterial ischaemia of the testicle 6 hours after the onset of pain. It is a surgical emergency.\n*The risk is that the prognosis for testicular function is compromised by ischaemia and testicular necrosis. This risk is statistically correlated with the duration of the ischaemia: the later the detorsion with revascularisation, the greater the risk to the endocrine and exocrine functions of the gonad.\n*Nevertheless, torsion of the spermatic cord is a therapeutic emergency whatever the duration of ischaemia.\n*There is no room for further investigations. If there is any doubt, surgery should be performed. Testicular Doppler ultrasound can be falsely reassuring. It is mainly prescribed to eliminate differential diagnoses or in cases of suspected long-standing torsion (> 24 hours), but should never delay therapeutic management.\n*The external detorsion manoeuvre has a very limited role. Its aim is to relieve the patient and reduce the duration of acute ischaemia, without delaying surgical management. Even if it is successful (regression of pain), it does not dispense with urgent surgical exploration, as one or more turns of coil may still remain on the spermatic cord.\n\n==''Necrotizing fasciitis'' :==\n\n*Necrotizing fasciitis or perineal gas gangrene is an anaerobic infection of the subcutaneous spaces of the perineum. It may affect fragile patients (diabetes, chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression, etc.). There may be a portal of entry (anal margin abscess, urethral catheterisation), but this is inconstant. It progresses in 3 phases: inflammation, gas gangrene and skin necrosis. It is accompanied by a serious septic state.\n*Management of necrotising fasciitis is a vital medical and surgical emergency: excision/drainage, broad antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, resuscitation. The prognosis is poor, with an estimated mortality rate of between 20 and 50%.\n\n==''Paraphimosis:'''==\n\n*Paraphimosis is a surgical emergency involving strangulation of the glans penis, leading to necrosis of the glans penis and sheath. Manual reduction with emergency recalibration is necessary.\n\n<br />",
