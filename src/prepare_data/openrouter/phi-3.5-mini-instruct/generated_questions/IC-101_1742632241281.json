Facial muscles innervated by cranial nerves other than the facial nerve are examined normally: masticatory muscles (trigeminal nerve), muscles of the pharynx and soft palate (glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves), muscles of the tongue (greater hypoglossus nerve).\n\n- Testing sensitivity in the Ramsay-Hunt zone.\n\n- Test the quality of lacrimal and salivary secretions (Schirmer test) and taste function on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (application of sweet, salty, acidic and bitter solutions).",
