It is a frequent cause of daytime and/or nocturnal urine leakage. Children also report pollakiuria and [[Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urgenturia 125]]. In the case of bladder hyperactivity, there is an uninhibited contraction of the detrusor which the child tries to control by sphincter contraction resulting in restraint manoeuvres (squatting, pinching the penis, crossing the legs, restlessness, standing on tiptoe, etc.).\n\n==In the case of [[Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|voiding disorders 125]] the main symptoms to look for are:==\n\n*Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urinary incontinence 125]] is an uncontrollable loss of urine which may be intermittent (daytime and/or nocturnal) or permanent. Permanent incontinence is permanent leakage without real micturition. It therefore forms part of the differential diagnosis of mictional disorders and is found in malformations of the urinary tract (ectopic abruption of the urinary tract in particular).\n\n*Nocturnal enuresis is an intermittent [[Urinary incontinence and micturition disorders in adults and the elderly|incontinence 125]] exclusively during sleep (night or nap) in a child of at least 5 years of age. Enuresis is said to be primary if the child has never had a period of continence during sleep of at least six months. If enuresis reappears after 6 months of voiding control, it is said to be secondary. Primary enuresis is said to be isolated or mono-symptomatic if there are no other symptoms, particularly daytime symptoms ([[Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urgenturia, pollakiuria, dysuria...125]]), affecting the lower urinary tract.\n\n*Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|Pollakiuria 125]] is an abnormal frequency of urination, more than 7 times a day, in a child over the age of 5.\n\n*Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|Imp\u00e9riosit\u00e9 or urgenturia 125]]: sudden, unexpected and immediate need to urinate.\n*Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|Dysuria 125]]: abdominal thrust during micturition to initiate or maintain bladder emptying (regardless of the child's age).\n*Fractional urination (considered physiological up to the age of 3, if not accompanied by abdominal thrust).\n*Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|Weak stream, irregular stream 125]]",
