Children who practise intensively (>6 hours/week before the age of 10 or more than 10 hours/week after the age of 10) have a higher risk of developing sports-related pathologies ([[Knowing the main pathologies linked to sport in children 2C-256-ET-B01|next title]]).\n\n- When the child practices intensively, the need to assess :\n\n*the impact of the sport on living conditions and learning at school (distance and travel time between training, home and school)\n\n*his average sleep time\n\n*the quality of the child's diet ([[Nutritional requirements of sports children 2C-256-PC-B04|following heading]]) and any dietary supplements used\n\n\nFinally, as in the case of adults, this consultation should be seen as a preventive consultation, with an update on growth curves, puberty and vaccinations.",
