The multidisciplinary therapeutic decision and patient information]] (2C-294 03-A, 2C-294-12-A and 2C-294-16-B)\n* Treatment method very different from surgery with daily radiotherapy for 4-6 weeks.\n* Exposes the patient to the risk of increased lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria and rectal bleeding during treatment.\n*Exposes the patient to the risk of distant functional and post-radiation complications:\n**Stenosis of the urethra\n**Radiation-induced cystitis/rectitis\n**Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)\n**Secondary cancer\n**Urination problems\n**Digestive transit disorders\n\n==Interstitial brachytherapy==\n\n*Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate via the perineal route. Unlike external radiotherapy, it can be performed in a single session.\n*Treatment with the lowest risk of causing erectile dysfunction.\n*Side effects are identical to those of radiotherapy.\n\n==Focused ultrasound (HIFU)\n\n*Allows prostate tissue to be destroyed by ultrasound.\n*Low morbidity.\n*Treatment of the prostate can be partial or total, with the possibility of a second session if necessary.\n*The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic in a single session.\n*Endoureteral resection is often associated with the procedure to reduce the risk of acute urine retention and severe dysuria.\n*Is a first-line treatment currently being evaluated.\n\n==Dynamic phototherapy==\n\n*Treatment under evaluation, not feasible outside clinical trials.\n\n\n\n'''<u>The indications according to D'Amico's group (CC-AFU 2022-2024)</u>''''\n\nPatients must be informed of: treatment modalities and complications, benefits/risks of treatment\n\nAll files must be presented to the oncology RCP.\n\n<u>-localised low risk</u>.\n\nActive surveillance is the recommended treatment\n\nThe options are: total prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, etc.\n\nIn clinical trials only: cryotherapy, HIFU\n\nHormonal treatment alone: not recommended\n\n<u>-localised intermediate risk</u>.\n\nTotal prostatectomy +/- curage\n\nRadiotherapy +/- hormone therapy 6 months\n\nBrachytherapy\n\nActive surveillance: in selected cases\n\nCryotherapy and HIFU: clinical trials only\n\nHormonal treatment alone: not recommended\n\n<u>-localised high-risk</u>\n\nLong-term hormone therapy (18-36 months) with pelvic radiotherapy\n\nTotal prostatectomy with curage\n\nCryotherapy and HIFU: not recommended\n\n\nFor hormone therapy for prostate cancer see Cancer treatments: [[2C-294]]: (2C-294-03-A, 2C-294-12-A and 2C-294-16-B)\n\n<br />",
