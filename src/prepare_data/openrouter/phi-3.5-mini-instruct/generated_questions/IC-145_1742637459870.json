It enables the health authorities to intervene rapidly to ''protect the health of the population'' and to have up-to-date information on a health problem deemed important.\n\nIn 2021, the Minister for Health will define 36 notifiable diseases (MDO), 34 of which are infectious diseases (most of which are transmissible). This [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire/liste-des-maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire list], available on the website [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/ www.santepubliquefrance.fr], may be updated as epidemiology evolves.\n\n'''The 3 actors are:'''\n\n*Declarants'': biologists and doctors confronted with a suspected or confirmed MDO;\n*the medical inspectors of the ''Agences R\u00e9gionales de Sant\u00e9'';\n*epidemiologists from ''[[Know the 4 main missions of Sant\u00e9 Publique France in the field of infectious diseases 2C-145-DE-B05|Sant\u00e9 Publique France]]''.\n\nCompulsory reporting is a two-stage process: firstly, reporting (with the exception of Pandemic Influenza outbreaks not requiring urgent public health measures) and secondly, notification (for all Pandemic Influenza outbreaks) (see Table).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Procedure'''\n|-\n|\n|'''Notification'''\n|'''Notification'''\n|-\n|'''Transmission sequence and delay''''\n|As a matter of urgency, as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed (or even as soon as the diagnosis is suspected for certain vector-borne diseases at risk of being established in mainland France).\n|Following notification\n|-\n|MDO concerned\n|All except HIV, HBV, tetanus\n|All\n|-\n|'''Finalit\u00e9'''\n|Implementation of urgent prevention or control measures around cases (prophylaxis, vaccination...)\n|Epidemiological monitoring\n|-\n|'''Support'''\n|By any appropriate means: telephone, fax, e-mail, etc.\n|Specific notification form for each MDO, to be downloaded from [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire/liste-des-maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire www.santepubliquefrance.fr], then sent by e-mail, post or fax.\n|-\n|Recipient\n| colspan=\"2\" |Physician inspector from the ARS responsible for the practice of the practitioner submitting the notification.\n|-\n|Types of data transmitted\n|Patient identity, demographic, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data\n|Anonymised sociodemographic, epidemiological, clinical and microbiological data\n|}\n'''Table: The two mandatory reporting procedures for the doctor who cares for the patient and/or the biologist who makes the diagnosis: reporting and notification.''''\n\nThe patient or the patient's family must be informed of this report.
