The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.\n\n=== '''Epidemiology''' ===\nThe main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex and a family history of AAA.\n\nAAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs).\n\nThe prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.\n\n=== '''Natural history''' ===\nThe diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be \"fast-growing\" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year.\n\nThe risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm.\n\nFor the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.\n\n=== '''Other aneurysmal locations''' ===\n\n==== Popliteal artery aneurysms ====\nAAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, but most often in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases).\n\nA popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived) or during ultrasound exploration (for example during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia or, more rarely, stress ischaemia.\n\nThe main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high.\n\nRarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis.\n\nRupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.\n\n==== Aneurysms of the iliac or femoral arteries ====\nMore rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.\n\n==== Thoracic aortic aneurysms ====\nAAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",
