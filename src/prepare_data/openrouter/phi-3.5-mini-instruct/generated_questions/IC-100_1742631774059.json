Identify a [[Headache SD-118|headache]]=\n- '''Adult and child of talking age''': the patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.\n\n- Infants and small children: atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilisation of the head, or on the contrary a prostrate, analgesic attitude.\n\n=2.     Reasoning when faced with a headache=\n- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.\n\n- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)\n\n- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?\n\n- '''Other features:'''\n\n- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)\n\n- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days\n\n- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)\n\n- Triggering and aggravating factors\n\n- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)\n\n- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated\n\n- '''Context of occurrence:'''\n\n- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors\n\n- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?\n\n- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)\n\n- '''Associated signs:'''\n\n- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]\n\n- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia\n\n- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]\n\n- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles\n\n- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]\n\n- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses\n\n- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month\n\n=4.      Physical examination=\n- To look for abnormalities that could guide further investigations.\n\n- Normal in primary headaches (except dysautonomic signs of a facial vascular attack)\n\n- General: blood pressure, temperature (beware of taking antipyretics, which can mask a fever), heart auscultation and skin examination (purpura).\n\n- '''Neurological:''' consciousness, meningeal syndrome (stiff neck), focal deficit, particularly cerebellar syndrome (ataxia may go unnoticed in a patient lying down and vomiting).\n\n- '''Neuro-ophthalmological''': visual field (homonymous lateral hemianopia), oculomotor paralysis (III or VI?), pupillary asymmetry (myosis/mydriasis), [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], (\u00b1 papilledema on fundus).\n\n- Local: inspection/palpation of skull, temporal arteries (if > 50 years old), eyeballs, ears, scalp (shingles), temporomandibular joints, neck.\n\n- ''Postural character'': assess the intensity of the headache in the standing position and then in the lying position.\n\n- Infant: fontanel (bulging?), cranial perimeter (increased?).\n\n=5.      Determination of acute or chronic nature=\n([[Chronic pain SD-035|chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]]; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]])\n\n- '''Any acute headache (in the sense of recent and unusual)''' is '''secondary''' until proven otherwise and requires urgent investigations. '''In practice:'''\n\n- Any sudden headache is a [[Arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces|subarachnoid haemorrhage]] (SAH) until proven otherwise.\n\n- Any progressive headache is a syndrome of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) until proven otherwise.\n\n- Any febrile headache with no other obvious cause is meningitis until proven otherwise.\n\n- Certain red flags (Tables 1 and 2) can help guide the diagnosis.\n\n- Any recent change in an old, habitual headache raises the suspicion of a secondary headache.\n\n\n- A ''chronic'' (in the sense of long-standing and habitual) headache is most often ''primary''. The interview must be perfectly detailed, as the diagnosis is based solely on the description of the headache. In practice, a distinction is made between :\n\n- Chronic episodic headaches (<15 headache days per month): episodic migraine and episodic tension headache\n\n- Chronic daily headaches (CCQ, 15 days or more per month) subdivided into :\n\n\u00a7 Long-term QCC (seizures > 4 hours) :\n\n\u00a7 Short-term QCC (attacks < 4 hours)\n\n\nBox 1.
