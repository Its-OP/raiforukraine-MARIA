By improving patients' physical condition and developing their social interactions, sporting activities help to prevent the onset of these chronic pathologies, increase overall life expectancy and improve the quality of life of patients of all ages ([Connaitre les principaux effets de l'activit\u00e9 physique et de la condition physique sur la sant\u00e9 en pr\u00e9vention primaire 2C-248-ET-A01|item 248]]).\n\n\nIn children, daily physical activity is necessary for the development and improvement of motor and physical skills.\n\nPractising sport has beneficial effects on mental health (increased self-esteem, reduced anxiety) and physical health (prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome). What's more, an individual who takes part in sporting activities as a child is more likely to do so as an adult. Physical activity in childhood therefore partly determines the health of future adults.\n\nInvolving children in competitions allows them to develop their social interactions and to test themselves against others, and is a vehicle for motivation and progress.\n\n\nAt any age, the risks of practising sport are :\n\n- Mainly cardiovascular.\n\nWhile regular physical activity has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, the fact remains that cardiovascular risk is transiently increased during intense physical exercise (increased cardiac output and arterial pressure during exercise), compared with the situation at rest.\n\nThis is why the [[Knowing the main causes of contraindications to practising sport 2C-256-DE-A01|main contraindications to practising sport]] are cardiovascular, and why [[Knowing how to conduct a medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport in adults 2C-256-PC-B01|the medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport]] focuses on the cardiovascular system.\n\n- Traumatic, depending on the type of sporting activity.",
