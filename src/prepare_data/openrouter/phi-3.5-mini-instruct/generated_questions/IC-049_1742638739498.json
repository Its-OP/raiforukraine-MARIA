It is not related to activation of the gonadotropic axis. It is a diagnosis of elimination, made after suggesting true precocious puberty.\n\nThe term menarche refers to the first menstrual period.",

      "question": "What is the primary distinction between premature pubarche and premature thelarche?",
      "option_a": "Premature pubarche is characterized by the development of breast tissue without pubic hair, while premature thelarche involves the appearance of pubic hair without breast tissue development.",
      "option_b": "Premature pubarche is due to pathological adrenal or gonadal androgen production, whereas premature thelarche is a physiological condition often presenting with isolated breast development without accelerated growth rate or pubic hair.",
      "option_c": "Premature pubarche and premature thelarche both refer to the early onset of menstruation.",
      "option_d": "Premature pubarche and premature thelarche are both conditions where accelerated growth rate is observed before the age of 2."
