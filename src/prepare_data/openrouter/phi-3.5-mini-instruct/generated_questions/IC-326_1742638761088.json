However, when marketing authorisation is granted, the benefit/risk ratio is generally assessed on the basis of data from clinical trials involving a <u>limited number of patients</u>. It is therefore necessary to continue analysing the '''benefit/risk ratio''' on the basis of available information, which is accumulating, including after marketing authorisation has been obtained. <ref>https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/regulatory-procedural-guideline/international-conference-harmonisation-technical-requirements-registration-pharmaceuticals-human-use_en-0.pdf</ref>\n\nThe \"benefit/risk ratio\" is therefore not fixed. It must be ''constantly updated'' in the light of new knowledge, and its re-evaluation may lead to the modification, suspension or withdrawal of a marketing authorisation.  \n\n=== Estimation at population or individual level ===\nEstimation of the benefit/risk balance is useful at various stages of drug development.\n\n* Manufacturers use it to decide whether or not to continue the development of a medicine.\n* The competent authorities use it to decide whether or not to grant marketing authorisation.\n* The Economic Committee for Health Products uses it to determine the price and reimbursement of a drug.\n* Physicians and patients use it to determine the most appropriate treatment for a given situation.\n\nIn the first three situations, the benefit-risk balance is assessed on a '''population''' scale. In the last situation, it is an '''individualised estimate''. <ref>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040595716312732</ref><references />",

    "option_a": "The benefit/risk ratio is fixed and does not require further evaluation.",
    "option_b": "The benefit/risk ratio is only assessed based on initial clinical trial data and remains unchanged.",
    "option_c": "The benefit/risk ratio must be constantly updated with new information, possibly leading to changes in marketing authorisation.",
    "option_d": "The benefit/risk ratio is solely determined by the Economic Committee for Health Products during the post-marketing phase.",
