Isolated macroscopic haematuria should always rule out a urological cause before turning to a nephrological cause.\n\n<br />\n\n*L''''ECBU'''' can be used to confirm haematuria (red blood cells in the urine), quantify it and rule out a [[Urinary tract infections in children and adults|urinary tract infection 161]].\n\n<br />\n\n'''The minimal work-up and assessment''' involves a blood count (CBC), a haemostasis work-up (TP/TCA +/- INR)\nand assessment of renal function (creatinine level and GFR estimate), with proteinuria detection by dipstick and quantification if positive.\n\n<br />\n\n*The minimal aetiological work-up involves 1st<sup>intention urinary tract imaging and urinary cytology, and most often urethrovesical fibroscopy (2nd<sup>intention). This work-up must be carried out early:\n**'''Urinary cytology''': on morning urine outside the haematuric episode. The pathologist looks for high-grade tumour cells (good sensitivity) in favour of a [[Bladder tumours|bladder urothelial carcinoma 314]] or of the upper excretory tract.\n**1<sup>rst</sup> line imaging: '''Renal-vesical ultrasound''''\n**'''Uro-scanner :'''' systematic reference examination. ''It comprises an injection-free phase (to look for calculi in the urinary tree and assess spontaneous densities), an arterial phase (to obtain contrast from a renal, bladder or upper excretory tract tumour, or a vascular anomaly) and a late excretory phase which may be combined with a nephrographic phase, most often sensitised by the injection of a diuretic. The late excretory time is used to visualise a gap in the urinary tree. Uro-MRI in cases where iodine is contraindicated''.\n**Traumatic haematuria: may require, after CT scan, diagnostic and/or therapeutic <u>arteriography</u> in case of active bleeding (arterioembolisation).\n**The '''urethrovesical fibroscopy''' ''(or flexible urethrocystoscopy)''' is performed by a urologist in consultation under local anaesthetic (intraurethral anaesthetic gel). Indications: imaging with no obvious aetiology, positive urine cytology (CIS = carcinoma in situ) or if there are risk factors for urothelial tumours (age, smoking or occupational exposure). Inspection of the ureteral meatus can sometimes reveal bloody urine ejaculate and lateralise haematuria from the upper excretory tract. When the aetiological diagnosis is obvious (large bladder tumour), urethrovesical fibroscopy is not necessary. Fibroscopy does not allow biopsies to be taken or the polyp to be resected (endoscopic resection using a rigid urethro-cystoscope in the operating theatre under anaesthetic).''\n**<Rigid or flexible ureteroscopy explores the ureter and renal cavities under general anaesthetic in the operating theatre. Indicated if tumour of the upper urinary excretory tract is suspected.\n\n<br />\n\n\nIn the event of nephrological referral (suggestive personal or family history, oedema of the lower limbs,\narterial hypertension, renal insufficiency, presence of blood vessels, etc.):\nSearch for 259 proteinuria (24-hour proteinuria or urine protein/creatinine ratio on sample), ideally outside a haematuric episode.\nan episode of haematuria. 24-hour proteinuria >2g or a urine protein/creatinine ratio >2g/g (especially if >70% albumin) is suggestive of glomerular haematuria.\nIndication for renal biopsy under ultrasound, discussed if microscopic haematuria associated with glomerular proteinuria 259\nglomerular proteinuria or in cases of recurrent macroscopic haematuria without urological aetiology (IgA nephropathy, for example).\n\n<br />\n\n*If no aetiology is found in this work-up (< 10% of clinical situations, mostly microscopic haematuria), the work-up should be repeated if the haematuria persists or recurs, especially in patients who smoke or are > 40 years old.",
