Knowing the correct use of the main therapeutic classes.\n|Item_parent_short=Prescribing and monitoring the most common classes of medicines for adults and children, excluding anti-infectives (see item 177). Knowing the correct use of the main therapeutic classes.\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Opioid analgesics: mechanisms of action, indications, side-effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure.\n|Description=Knowing the mechanisms of action\n|Rubric=Management\n|Contributors=Nadine Attal,Gis\u00e8le Pickering\n|Order=17}}\n\n==Opioid analgesics==\n\n*These include weak (or tier II) opioids such as tramadol, codeine and opium powder, and strong (or tier III) opioids such as morphine, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, hydromorphone, buprenorphine, nalbuphine, naloxone, oxycodone/naloxone and tapentadol.\n*There are oral sustained-release (SR) forms for long-term analgesic action and immediate-release (IR) forms, suitable for the initiation of treatment, emergencies, paroxysmal attacks of pain and pain induced by care.\n*Opium powder, tramadol and codeine are available in combination with oral paracetamol (opium powder only), and tramadol and codeine (dihydrocodeine) are available as sustained-release tablets.\n*Strong opiates are available in oral form (morphine sulphate, oxycodone immediate or extended release, methadone and hydromorphone extended release), transdermal (fentanyl), sublingual (fentanyl, buprenorphine), buccal, gingival, oromucosal, buccal and nasal (fentanyl), IV (morphine hydrochloride, oxycodone, nalbuphine, naloxone), SC, IM (morphine hydrochloride, nalbuphine), epidural, intrathecal (morphine hydrochloride) (see Lisa 135 for details of dosage forms)\n\n==Mechanisms==\nThey act on the endogenous pain control systems by binding to opiate receptors (mu, delta, kappa) in the brain, spinal cord and periphery.\n\nWe make a distinction:\n\n*strong full agonists (morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone)\n*weak full agonists (codeine, opium powder), partial agonists (bupr\u00e9horphine)\n*antagonistic agonists (nalbuphine)\n*antagonists (naloxone, methylnatreexone, naloxegol)\n*combination of weak agonist and monoamine reuptake inhibitor effects for tramadol (mainly serotonin) and tapentadol (mainly norepinephrine)\n\n==Directions==\n\n===Weak opioids including tramadol===\nModerate to severe pain or pain not responding to level I analgesics, including: acute or chronic pain, preferably over a short period in the event of a painful flare-up, alone or in combination with paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Not indicated for: neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, unexplained pain. Avoid long-term use in headaches.\n\nTramadol, the only weak opioid indicated for neuropathic pain (see Lisa 135).\n\n===Strong epioids (except tapentadol, acute pain only)===\nmoderate to severe pain unresponsive to level II analgesics or initially very intense, whether acute or chronic, i.e. cancer pain (MA) or non-cancer pain only after failure of medicinal and non-medicinal treatments (overall bio-psycho-social management) and after failure of aetiological treatments in an indication where the benefit-risk ratio is potentially favourable (see Lisa 135 for details). Pre-prescription assessment/research into the risk of misuse. Not for use in nociplastic/dysfunctional pain (fibromyalgia, irritable bowel, etc.) or primary headache (migraine, etc.). Parenteral routes, including PCA, are recommended for acute pain (postoperative for PCA). Epidural and intrathecal routes are recommended for certain types of post-operative pain or pain caused by cancer. Parenteral forms are not indicated for chronic pain.\n\n===Naloxone===\nantagonises the effects of opioids if overdosed\n\n===Other indications===\nsubstitution treatments (methadone, high-dose buprenorphine), restless legs syndrome (oxycodone-naloxone combination)\n\n==Usual side effects, contraindications ==\n\n*All : Drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, urinary retention/dysuria, risk of tolerance (need to increase the dose to obtain the same effect), physical dependence (onset of withdrawal syndrome on discontinuation) or psychological dependence or addiction (behavioural disorder with compulsive seeking of the product), lowering of the epileptogenic threshold; contraindications: decompensated respiratory insufficiency, severe hepatocellular or renal insufficiency (clearance < 15 ml/min), uncontrolled epilepsy, intracranial hypertension, acute alcohol intoxication and delirium tremens, associations with MAOIs, pregnancy (especially in the last trimester), breast-feeding.\n*Strong opiates: confusion, hallucinations, cognitive disorders, pruritus.\n*Tramadol: specific adverse effects: dry mouth, serotonin syndrome (especially if used in combination with antidepressants), visual disorders.\n*Contraindications in children under 12 for codeine, and 18 for codeine if tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.\n\n==Interactions==\n\n*Tramadol and codeine: Treatments that inhibit CYP2D6 may reduce the effect of tramadol and codeine: serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, antipsychotics (haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone, etc.), antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, flecanide, propafenone, etc.). Combination with drugs that inhibit cytochrome CYP3A4 increases the risk of adverse effects: antifungals (ketoconazole), antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, etc.), amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil.\n*Risk of increased respiratory depression if combined with benzodiazepines, psychotropic drugs and alcohol, risk of increased dysuria or confusion if combined with tricyclics.\n*Pure agonists should not be combined with partial agonist-antagonists or agonist-antagonists (risk of withdrawal or loss of analgesic action).\n\n==Surveillance methods==\n\n*Clinical: drowsiness, dysuria, nausea, vomiting (neuroleptics if necessary), confusion, constipation (systematic laxative if strong opiates), respiratory depression (naloxone if severe).\n*Look for metabolic disorders if confusion, hallucinations or persistent vomiting, and rule out faecal impaction if constipation is unresponsive.\n*Withdrawal of opioids or reduction in dose if drowsiness, cognitive or confusional problems, pruritus.\n\n==Main causes of failure==\n\n*Undesirable effects +++\n*Doses too low (no titration)\n*Genetic polymorphism (codeine, tramadol)\n*Patch detachment if transdermal fentanyl (sweating, etc)\n*Tolerance to opiates\n*Hyperalgesia to opiates (resulting in increased or extended pain) after long-term treatment, especially if doses are high.\n*Progression of the cancerous disease",
