The test can detect over 90% of allergies before the age of 6 and over 80% after the age of 6. A negative result rules out an allergy to the panel of allergens tested.\n\n\nWarning: ''a positive multi-allergen test does not mean allergy''. In fact, if exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy (e.g. positive specific IgE to peanuts, even though the patient eats peanuts without any problem, means sensitisation and not allergy). This is important because it is not necessary to avoid the food in this case, or even \"it may lead to a long-term allergy to the food\" (break in tolerance).   ",
