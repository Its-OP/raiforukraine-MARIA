The patient briefly stands still in a painful attitude.\n\n- '''Topography''': unilateral and strictly localised:\n\no in the trigeminal area (but not beyond) ;\n\no single-branch (maxillary V2: 40%, maxillary V3: 20%, ophthalmic V1: 10%); or double-branch.\n\n- '''Triggering factors''': pain triggered electively by excitation of a specific area of skin in the painful territory, the '''trigger zone'''. A light touch is enough. Attacks can be triggered by speech, mimicry, laughter or chewing, so the patient tries to keep a still face and eat as little as possible.\n\n- '''Clinical examination:'''\n\no ''Normal in classical and idiopathic neuralgia'': facial and corneal sensitivity (corneal reflex present), strength of masticatory muscles (innervated by the V motor) normal, absence of any neurological damage, normal skin.\n\no The presence of the slightest abnormality (hypoesthesia, motor damage to the V3 branch) points to \"secondary neuralgia\".\n\n'''<u>Trigeminal neuralgia or secondary trigeminal neuropathic pain</u>''''\n\n- When pain is localised to the V territory, the aim is to rule out secondary neuralgia (due to a cause other than a vascular-nervous impingement) or secondary painful neuropathy.\n\n- '''Secondary neuralgia''': pain in the form of an electric discharge, with a trigger zone. Sometimes the clinical examination is strictly normal, which is why an MRI scan is necessary for any trigeminal neuralgia ([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]).\n\n- '''Secondary trigeminal neuropathic pain''': the pain is of the continuous burning type, sometimes with additional discharges.\n\n- '''Red flags''': A secondary cause must be evoked when :\n\no a young age of onset (MS),\n\no less intense discharges (painful neuropathy),\n\no a preponderance in the V1 territory (shingles?),\n\no a painful background with paresthesia and hypoesthesia (painful neuropathy)\n\no clinical abnormality: hypoesthesia, reduced corneal reflex, V3 motor damage (masseter, pterygoid) and/or damage to other cranial nerves on the same side.\n\n- '''[[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Investigations]]'''': A cerebral MRI with thin sections of the brainstem and trigeminal nerve along its entire course (with gadolinium injection) is imperative, along with a biological work-up and sometimes a lumbar puncture.",
