The major criteria are not all contemporary, so it is important to look for them during the history-taking interview.\n\n! A high level of irritability is almost constant in infants and young children.\n\nOther organ disorders may be associated (systemic vasculitis): cardiac (myocarditis, pericarditis), hepatobiliary (hepatitis, hydrocholecyst), neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis), pulmonary, ocular (uveitis) or digestive.\n\n\n'''Incomplete form'''\n\nThere are incomplete forms (fewer than 4 major criteria), which can lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in younger children, and thus expose them to a greater risk of cardiac complications.\n\nIn the presence of unexplained fever lasting more than 5 days, with a patient in poor general condition, it is therefore important to be able to investigate this diagnosis (in addition to the infectious work-up) by means of a biological work-up and cardiac ultrasound.\n\nA normal cardiac ultrasound scan does not rule out the diagnosis, but in the case of coronary dilatation, the diagnosis may be accepted even if there are fewer than 4 other major criteria other than fever.\n\n\n'''Biological abnormalities'''\n\nThe following anomalies are often observed:\n\n- inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and SV, hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis (appearing later (D10) than the other parameters), hypoalbuminemia\n\n- liver abnormality: moderate cytolysis (frequent), more rarely elevated bilirubin\n\n- very frequent aseptic leucocyturia\n\n- Aseptic meningitis (when LP is performed)\n\n\n'''Complications'''\n\n- acute: multisystemic form \"Kawasaki shock\" with myocarditis, multivisceral damage, macrophagic activation syndrome\n\n\n- sub-acute: ''dilatation of the coronary arteries'' which may lead to aneurysm. The risk of dilatation is increased after 10 days without treatment, so the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is urgent.\n\nDiagnosis is made using a transthoracic ''cardiac ultrasound'' by a cardiologist with experience of this disease.\n\n\n'''Care/Orientation'''\n\nSuspicion of Kawasaki disease warrants a hospital assessment\n\nOnce the diagnosis has been made, treatment is always \"hospital-based\" and involves an infusion of intravenous polyvalent immunoglobulin and aspirin in anti-inflammatory and then anti-aggregating doses for a total period of 6 to 8 weeks.\n\nCardiological monitoring with ultrasound must be put in place",
