This increase in LV pressure is associated with an increase in pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary capillaries (> 25 mmHg). This pressure is higher than the interstitial oncotic pressure and results in the formation of a transudate in the pulmonary alveoli. The alveoli are \"flooded\" and haematosis is altered.\n\nRemarks :\n\n- OAP results in impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxaemia.\n\n- It is associated with a compensatory mechanism resulting in hyperventilation, leading initially to hypocapnia.\n\n- Clinical picture of acute respiratory failure associating :\n\no Dyspnoea with orthopnoea,\n\no Frothy expectoration\n\no Anxiety and agitation, sweating\n\no Peripheral cyanosis\n\no Crackles on pulmonary auscultation\n\nThis is a therapeutic emergency.",
