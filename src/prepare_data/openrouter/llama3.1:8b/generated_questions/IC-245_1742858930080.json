In addition, there is an accumulation of precursors upstream of the block: elevation of androgens (17 OH progesterone) resulting in hyperandrogenism and virilisation in young girls.\n\n'''-in the context of adrenoleukodystrophy''': mutation of a gene encoding a transporter of very long-chain fatty acids in the peroxisome leads to an accumulation of these molecules in the cells.",
