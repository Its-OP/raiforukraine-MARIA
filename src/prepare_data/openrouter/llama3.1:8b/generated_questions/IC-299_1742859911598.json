    "option_a": "Perform a thorough physical examination focusing only on the skin and breast",
    "option_b": "Conduct a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic scan with contrast medium, as well as mammography in women, and consider fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanner if necessary",
    "option_c": "Limit the search to the thoracic-abdominal-pelvic region only, without considering other potential sites of primary cancer",
