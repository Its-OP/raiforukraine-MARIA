It enables the health authorities to intervene rapidly to ''protect the health of the population'' and to have up-to-date information on a health problem deemed important.\n\nIn 2021, the Minister for Health will define 36 notifiable diseases (MDO), 34 of which are infectious diseases (most of which are transmissible).
