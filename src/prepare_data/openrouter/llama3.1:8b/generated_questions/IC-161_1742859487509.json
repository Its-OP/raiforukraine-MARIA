The risk of progression to ANP is exceptional.\n\n==The current recommendations for antibiotic treatment are (molecules in order of prescription preference):==\n\n*Bosfomycin-Trometamol single dose\n*Pivmecillinam\n*If the 2 previous molecules are not possible: ECBU to guide choice of treatment\n\n\n\u25cf '''<u>Fluoroquinolones are in all cases to be banned in this indication and should never be used to treat cystitis</u>''''\n\n\u25cf Cure is usually obtained within 72 hours. In the event of clinical failure, an ECBU should be carried out (to look for bacteria resistant to the antibiotic used) or the diagnosis should be questioned.\n\n\u25cf The preventive measures to be proposed are those for recurrent cystitis (see dedicated section)",
