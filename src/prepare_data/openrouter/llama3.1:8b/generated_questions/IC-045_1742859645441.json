The most common example is a fusion between chromosome 14 and 21.\n\n\nNB: partial trisomy 21 can be identified by an unbalanced translocation involving part of chromosome 21 and part of another chromosome.\n\nFor a person with trisomy 21, there is no phenotypic difference depending on the chromosomal anomaly, except in the case of weak mosaics (less than 50%) and partial trisomy 21.",
