The sting remains in the skin, causing the bee's abdomen to rupture. The main allergen in the venom is phospholipase A2.\n\nWasps are more aggressive than bees and can sting for no apparent reason, sometimes several times because the sting does not stay in the skin. They sting until late autumn. Hyaluronidase, antigen 5 and phospholipase A1 are the 3 major allergens in the venom.\n\nHornets belong to the same family as wasps. Their stings are more painful and the quantity of venom injected is greater. Allergic reactions are often \"crossed with wasp venom allergy\" (similar composition), and \"sometimes with bee venom\" (50% homology between phospholipase A2 from hornet venom / phospholipase A2 from bee venom).\n\n\nPrevalence of hymenoptera allergy :\n\n- 10 to 40% of the population is sensitised (so not necessarily allergic; beekeepers in particular are very frequently sensitised and rarely allergic)\n\n0.3 to 7.5% of the general population suffer systemic reactions, potentially causing severe anaphylaxis, with a low mortality rate (0.03 to 0.45/million population/year).",
