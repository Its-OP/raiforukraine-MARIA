    "question": "What is the primary reason for adapting antimicrobial treatment in cases of bacteremia/fungemia?",
    "option_a": "Due to the severity of the infection, treatment must be adapted based on the direct examination of blood cultures (Gram stain)",
    "option_b": "Antimicrobial treatment is primarily adapted based on species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing/antifungal susceptibility testing, but secondary adaptation is also made based on direct examination of blood cultures (Gram stain)",
    "option_c": "Adaptation of antimicrobial treatment is primarily based on the direct examination of blood cultures (Gram stain), with secondary adaptation based on species identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing/antifungal susceptibility testing",
    "option_d": "Antimicrobial treatment is adapted primarily based on clinical judgment and experience, with secondary adaptation based on direct examination of blood cultures (Gram stain) and species identification",
