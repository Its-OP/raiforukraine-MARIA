Schematically:\n**in the event of overall dehydration, priority should be given to correcting blood volume by administering hypotonic saline at 4.5 g/L;\n**in the case of pure intracellular dehydration, drinking water should be given (never give pure water intravenously, as this would induce haemolysis);\n**in the event of associated extracellular hyperhydration, a diuretic with pure water (PO) or a hypotonic solution (IV) should be prescribed.",
