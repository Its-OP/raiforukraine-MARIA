In some patients with distal constipation and the presence of faeces in the rectal ampulla (= faecal impaction), the breakdown of these faeces in the rectum can lead to \"false diarrhoea\", most often reported by the patient as episodes of sudden diarrhoea following several days of constipation, with frequent repetition of this \"cycle\".\n\n\nClinical examination\n\nExamination of the abdomen may reveal tenderness in the left iliac fossa, opposite the left colon and sigmoid, where faecal matter is stored. The presence of faecal matter can be perceived. Abdominal meteorism may also be observed. It looks for signs of a secondary cause. A proctological examination is essential in cases of constipation.\n\nExamination of the anal margin to look for local lesions (haemorrhoids, fissures, etc.).\n\nThe rectal examination ensures that there are no anal or rectal lesions. It can also be used to check for the presence of abnormal matter in the rectal ampulla (faecal impaction), to assess anal sphincter tone and to look for a rectocele.\n\nThe \"dynamic\" perineal examination consists of examining the patient during pushing, in particular. It can reveal a problem with the contraction of the external anal sphincter (most often a lack of relaxation or paradoxical contraction during pushing), and reveal anatomical problems such as perineal descent.",
