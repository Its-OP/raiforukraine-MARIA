Radiographic diagnosis is more difficult in a supine patient. Exhalation X-rays are not recommended as they may increase the size of the pneumothorax.\n\nPleural ultrasound is a non-invasive examination that can be performed in the patient's bed (lying or sitting). In trained hands, it may be more sensitive than radiography for detecting small NOPs.\n\nA chest CT scan is the most sensitive examination (a normal CT scan rules out the presence of a PNO) but is not essential for diagnosis. Its main indications are :\n\n* Chest X-ray difficult to interpret\n* Recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax looking for apical bubbles or underlying lung disease.\n* Assessment for certain \"at risk\" professionals (divers, pilots)\n* Traumatic pneumothorax: look for other associated traumatic abnormalities.\n\nMRI and FDG PET-CT have no place in the assessment of ONP.\n\n\n'''Semiology:'''\n\nStanding chest x-ray\n\n* Crescent-shaped avascular apico-lateral lung hyperclarity, delimited inferiorly and medially by a thin oblique line corresponding to the visceral pleura (Figure 1)\n* Hydroaeric level if hydropneumothorax (Figure 2).\n<gallery widths=\"450\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:PNO1.JPG|'''Figure 1.'''
