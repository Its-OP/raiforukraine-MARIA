Histological diagnosis: renal biopsy\n\n1.        Renal puncture biopsy (RPB)\n\nIndications:\n\nGlomerular nephropathy syndrome, with the exception of the following four cases:\n\n*Pure nephrotic syndrome in a child aged between 1 and 10 years,\n*diabetic retinopathy on fundus without haematuria in a patient with known diabetes,\n*amyloidosis documented on a non-renal biopsy (salivary glands),\n*hereditary cluster disease already documented in the family.\n\n\nInterest :\n\n*Diagnostic value: guides the etiological investigation;\n*Therapeutic interest: guides the treatment of certain glomerular nephropathies;\n*Prognostic value (depending on the severity of lesions).\n\n\nContraindications:\n\n*Single kidney;\n*Poorly controlled hypertension (contraindicated until hypertension is controlled);\n*Anatomical abnormalities (multiple cysts, horseshoe-shaped kidneys, suspected periarteritis nodosa, etc.);\n*Acute pyelonephritis (temporary contraindication);\n*Coagulation disorders: questioning +++, CBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), PT, APTT, primary haemostasis study. Antiplatelet agents are stopped: aspirin 5 days, clopidogrel 10 days before the procedure. In the event of haemostasis problems, a transjugular PBR should be considered.\n\n\nTerms and conditions :\n\n*Look for any contraindications.\n*Hospitalization is essential.\n*Inform the patient of the benefits and risks of the procedure.\n*Carry out a blood group determination and RAI.\n*Percutaneous biopsy under ultrasound control.\n*Local anaesthetic.\n*Two samples are taken for light microscopy and immunofluorescence, sometimes an additional sample is taken for electron microscopy (suspicion of Alport syndrome, immunoglobulin deposition disease).\n\n\nComplications :\n\n*Acute = bleeding:\n**perirenal haematoma (subcapsular) ;\n**retroperitoneal haematoma (0.5 to 1%): more or less severe haemorrhagic syndrome;\n**intra-renal haematoma ;\n**macroscopic haematuria (1 to 10%) +/- clotting of the urinary tract: renal colic and/or urinary retention;\n**management may require embolisation or even haemostasis nephrectomy.\n\n*Chronic: arteriovenous fistula (0.1 to 0.5%), murmur, hypertension, risk of rupture.",
