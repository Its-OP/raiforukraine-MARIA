(Cf. [[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|53. Hypertension during pregnancy]])''''\n\nWe define :\n\n- Pregnancy-induced hypertension: hypertension appearing after 20 weeks' gestation, without associated proteinuria and disappearing before the end of the 6th week postpartum.\n\n- Preeclampsia: association of gestational hypertension with proteinuria (300 mg/24 h). It is said to be \"added\" when it occurs in a patient with chronic hypertension (Cf. [[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|182. Urine dipstick analysis]] / [[Proteinuria SD-212|212. Proteinuria]])''''\n\n- Chronic hypertension: hypertension prior to pregnancy but sometimes unrecognised. It should be considered if the hypertension is discovered before 20 weeks' gestation or if it persists for more than 6 weeks post-partum.\n\nA distinction is made between :\n\n- Moderate hypertension: SBP: 140-159 mmHg and DBP: 90-109 mmHg\n\n- Severe hypertension: SBP \u2265 160 mmHg and/or DBP \u2265 110 mmHg.",
