The external plexus is only visible in the event of a complication (thrombosis). Apart from the very specific case of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, haemorrhoids cannot be palpated. The anal touch is insufficient for diagnosis. The epithelial lining is intestinal in the internal haemorrhoidal plexus and squamous in the external haemorrhoidal plexus. The internal haemorrhoidal plexus forms swellings or pads. It plays a part in the resting tone of the upper part of the anal canal and in fine continence.",
