It is therefore important to prevent both dehydration and malnutrition.\n\nPrevention/treatment of dehydration\n\n- Rehydration should be oral whenever possible (weight loss < 10% of body weight and no sign of hypovolaemia) ''with an oral rehydration solution (ORS),'' with fractions if vomiting occurs (see item 286).\n\n- in the event of failure of oral rehydration with ORS or initial signs of severity (weight loss > 10%, hypovolaemia): inpatient intravenous rehydration (after vascular filling in the event of hypovolaemia (haemodynamic disorders) - physiological serum NaCL 9\u2030 20ml/kg) with isotonic polyionic glucose solution at least 4g/L of NacL (beware of correcting hypernatraemia too quickly and the risk of cerebral oedema, so importance of monitoring natraemia). The flow rate is 150ml/kg/d in infants, 100 to 120ml/kg/d thereafter, to be adapted to losses and progress (weight, diuresis) then ORS relay according to progress after at least 6 hours.\n\n- if the oral route fails and the approach is difficult\n\n           - or signs of hypovolaemia, in which case the intraosseous line should be filled and then infused\n\n           - or no haemodynamic problems: trial of enteral ORS via a nasogastric tube (200ml/kg/d to be adapted).\n\nPrevention of undernutrition\n\n'''Do not stop feeding''': alternate feedings and ORS if breast-feeding, resume milk-based feeding (other than breast milk) within 4 to 6 hours of starting ORS rehydration with previous milk (lactose-free only if severe and/or persistent), continue previous diversified diet (no diet).\n\n'''Symptomatic treatment'''\n\nThey are only moderately effective and should not be prescribed at the expense of ORS, i.e. as a second-line treatment, after ORS +++.\n\nMarketing authorisation for children: diosmectite and racecadrotil\n\nNot recommended: anti-emetics\n\nContraindication: loperamide (occlusive syndrome)",
