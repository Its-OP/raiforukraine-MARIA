Be able to make the link between an objective and one or more types of survey.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Josiane Warszawski (CIMES),Alexandra Rouquette (CIMES)\n|Order=18}}\n\nUnlike experimental studies, in observational studies the nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects included in the study are subjected are not modified by the researcher (see [[Methods adapted to a research objective 2C-020-DE-B03]]).\n\nThere are three main types of observational survey design, the choice of which must be adapted to the objective of the study.\n\n== Cohort survey ==\nEnables a sample of subjects to be \"followed over time\":\n\n* binary judgement criterion: not affected by the health phenomenon studied and to record the number of new cases that appear over time.\n* quantitative endpoint: to monitor changes in the endpoint (e.g. viral load, level of depression, etc.) whose level is known at inclusion.\n\nCan meet ''objectives'':\n\n* <u>Descriptive</u>: to estimate the frequency of occurrence of the disease (cf. [[Frequency measurement, Prevalence, Incidence (rate of), Risk 2C-020-DE-A07]]), possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population, or in other populations, or between several periods, possibly standardising on the distribution of sex, age (cf. [[Adjusted frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13|Standardised frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13]])\n* <u>Analytical</u>: to study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied by comparing frequency indicators of the health phenomenon between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects by tests and measures of association (cf. [Raw or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), number needed to treat (NNT) and crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]] and [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]. ).\n\nMethods of '''recruitment''' of the subjects making up the sample at the initial time :\n\n* <u>Cohort study with a cross-sectional starting point</u>: initial sample formed from the selection (preferably exhaustive) or random drawing of subjects presenting consecutively at one or more recruitment centres (source population, cf. [[Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05]]). This sampling aims to have the best possible representativeness of the target population.\n<u>Exposed/unexposed cohort studies</u>: a particular form of cohort in which exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.\n\n'''Follow-up''' after inclusion: what characterises a cohort is this follow-up of subjects (= <u>longitudinal study</u>) since their inclusion for a period generally determined for the study in order to collect data after inclusion:\n\n* the possible occurrence of the event studied (absent at inclusion) when the endpoint is qualitative with its date of occurrence, or changes in the level of the endpoint if it is quantitative (for which the baseline level is available at inclusion)\n* the date of early exit from the study due to death (if not part of the endpoint itself), relocation or lack of news (lost to follow-up).\n\nRetrospective, prospective or mixed character:\n\n* <u>Prospective cohort</u>: the start of inclusions is after the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n* <u>Retrospective cohort (= historical)</u>: the start of inclusions is prior to the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n** The initial sample is reconstituted ''a posteriori'' as it might have been constituted in the past by selecting a group of subjects at an initial time in the past. This is only possible when we have a file of identifiable subjects for such a study (for example, a file of company employees with occupational health data) whose status with regard to the health phenomenon studied at inclusion can be determined, even for subjects who can no longer be contacted at the time the study is designed.\n** The follow-up history of these subjects between inclusion and the point date is therefore reconstructed retrospectively. This is therefore only possible if individual follow-up of subjects from inclusion to the point date is available.\n* <u>Mixed cohort</u>: combination of the two previous modes of inclusion (inclusion and follow-up partly retrospective then continuing after protocol finalisation prospective manner).\n\n== Case-control study\nInvolves the separate selection of two groups of subjects:\n\n* a group of subjects suffering from the event under study (''cases'')\n* a group of subjects not affected by the event under study (''controls'')\n\n'''Advantage''': being able to over-represent in the sample people carrying a phenomenon to be studied <u>rare</u> in the population (often a disease). In this case, it can be interesting to include several controls per case because the statistical power increases, but in general this gain is minimal compared with the logistical complexity beyond 5 controls per case.\n\nMeets exclusively '''analytical objectives''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls by calculating the <u>odds-ratio</u>, which is the only measure of association that can generally be estimated in this type of survey (cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]).\n\nRecruitment of cases:\n\n* <u>Case-incident</u> (= the subject is included at the time he or she becomes a case): recruitment of cases on the occasion of diagnosis or the occurrence of the event.\n* <u>Prevalent-case</u> (= when included the subject has already been a case for some time): recruitment of cases regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made (recruitment more often the source of selection bias - selective survival bias, cf. [[Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias 2C-020-DE-A12]] - but generally allows faster recruitment than case-incident recruitment because it is possible to \"draw on\" the active files of patients who have already been diagnosed).\n\nProcedures for '''recruiting controls''' must be thought through very carefully because, ideally, controls should come from the same population as cases: i.e. <u>any controls eligible and identifiable for the study could have been recruited as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon under study.</u> It is often done in parallel with the recruitment of cases, with possibly <u>matching</u> or <u>stratification.</u>\n\n'''Collection of exposures''' always <u>retrospective</u> in a case-control study for these two groups of subjects: the period covered by the collection of information on exposure is therefore always prior to the start of the survey.\n\n== Cross-sectional survey ==\nMainly used to'''' estimate the level of qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances, etc.)''' in a targeted population.\n\nCan meet a number of objectives:\n\n* '''Mainly descriptive''': estimating the level of indicators in a target population with a quantifiable margin of error (confidence interval) due to sampling fluctuations. In particular, this is the only study that makes it possible to estimate <u>prevalences</u> of a binary health phenomenon at the time of the study in a target population (provided that the sample recruited is representative of the population targeted in theory by the objectives)\n* '''Sometimes analytical''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the studied phenomenon collected at the time of the study, by estimating measures of association (relative risk, odds ratio, cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]). But the interpretation of these associations is all the more limited because the <u>chronological relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied</u> is not always easy to establish, and because previously exposed subjects who have developed a rapidly fatal form of the disease will not be included in the study (selective survival bias, see [[More advanced knowledge on biases 2C-020-DE-B14]]).\n\nRecruitment procedures: guided by the need to be as representative as possible of the population targeted by the study. Selection must be independent, i.e. it must not take into account the subjects' health status or the level of exposure, which we may be seeking to study if they constitute risk factors for the phenomenon under study. Random selection or consecutive inclusion of subjects within a source population are the methods of choice for these studies.\n\n'''Information collected''': status of each subject included with regard to the phenomenon studied and possibly exposure factors at the time of inclusion, regardless of the age of the events collected. It is not uncommon to collect in addition the <u>background and history</u> on the phenomenon studied and the exposure factors of the subjects relating to the period prior to inclusion, possibly since their birth. In contrast, <u>no data on events occurring after the subject's inclusion in the study are collected in a cross-sectional survey</u>.",
