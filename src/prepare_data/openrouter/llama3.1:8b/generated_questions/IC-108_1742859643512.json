(see item 132)\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Know the main differential diagnoses of AD\n|Description=Confusion, functional causes, curable organic causes\n|Heading=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=\n|Order=10}}\nThe main differential diagnoses of AD are :\n\n- '''Mental confusion''' '''([[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]])''' (cf. definition and diagnosis of mental confusion items 108, 342)\n\no Beware! confusion may be a means of discovering dementia or may occur during the course of dementia: always look for AD or another dementia at a distance from a confusional episode.\n\n- Functional causes of cognitive impairment\n\no Depression '''([[Sad mood/moral pain SDD-123|sad mood/moral pain]])''', chronic anxiety '''([[Anxiety SDD-116|anxiety]])''', (cf. item 66 Diagnose: depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder (from children to the elderly), personality disorder), use of psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnotics, etc.) (cf. item 74. Prescribe a treatment for chronic anxiety).) (cf. item 74. Prescription and monitoring of psychotropic drugs), sleep disorders (insomnia and sleep apnoea) '''([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SDD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia]])''' (cf. item 110. Sleep disorders in children and adults)\n\no May lead to attention and executive function problems affecting memory function (\"pseudo-amnesia\" marked above all by encoding and retrieval problems).\n\no Beware! depression and anxiety can be associated with AD: suggest trial treatment with antidepressants and reassess cognition at a later stage.\n\n- '''Organic causes'''\n\no \"Secondary\" and possibly curable dementia\n\n\u00a7 Hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, syphilis, HIV, certain brain tumours (frontal meningiomas).\n\n\u00a7 Chronic adult hydrocephalus (formerly known as \"normal pressure\" hydrocephalus) (see item 109. Gait and balance disorders and cf. item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic adult hydrocephalus) : leads to '''disorders''' of walking (with small steps) and '''of balance ([[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]])''', frontal-type cognitive disorders with apathy ('''[[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]'''), and urinary control disorders ('''[[Urinary incontinence SD-103|urinary incontinence]]'''); A diagnostic and therapeutic test consists of performing evacuating lumbar punctures; surgical treatment by ventriculoperitoneal shunt is proposed when the diagnostic probability is high.\n\n\u00a7 Subdural haematoma (cf item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma): a frequent cause of cognitive disorders (psychomotor slowing, apathy, frontal syndrome, mental confusion, etc.) in the elderly, often detected at a distance from a head injury, even a mild one, or even unnoticed, subdural haematoma is favoured by dehydration, chronic alcoholism and treatments affecting coagulation.\n\n\u00a7 Post-traumatic encephalopathy\n\n\u00a7 Alcohol-related cognitive disorders (alcoholic dementia) (see item 76 alcohol addiction)\n\n\u00a7 Vascular encephalopathy or vascular dementia (see item 132 question Positive diagnosis - Vascular encephalopathy)\n\no '''Subacute encephalopathies''' (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, inflammatory or autoimmune encephalitis, including paraneoplastic syndromes), if the dementia syndrome progresses rapidly (<1 year).\n\no '''Other degenerative dementias'''\n\n\u00a7 Frontotemporal dementia (or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, FTLD)'' (see item 132 question Frontotemporal lobar degeneration)\n\n\u00a7 Diffuse Lewy body disease (see item 132 question Lewy body disease)",
