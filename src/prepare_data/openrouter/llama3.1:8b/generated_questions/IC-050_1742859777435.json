Urethritis is manifested by a more or less purulent spontaneous meatus discharge outside the micturition period and burning during micturition.\n*The clinical presentation of orchiepidydimitis is that of painful enlargement of a bursa associated with progressive or sudden onset fever of variable intensity depending on the associated pathogens (STI, BGN) and local signs of variable intensity: scrotal pain radiating along the cord of gradual and not sudden onset (as opposed to torsion of the spermatic cord), painful induration of the cord and all or part of the epididymis, inflamed scrotum.\n*Classically, lifting the testicle relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign), making it possible to distinguish torsion.\n*It is important to look for favouring factors such as the insertion of a bladder catheter (BCC) and also the indwelling use of a BCC, the recent performance of an endoscopy, the existence of a [[Benign prostatic hypertrophy|prostatic adenoma (127)]], a urethral stricture, a notion of contagion (in favour of an STI).\n*The presence of [[Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urinary signs (125)] (burning, dysuria, pollakiuria) with high fever, sweating and chills should prompt a search for an associated [[Urinary infections in children and adults|acute prostatitis (161)]]. A rectal examination will reveal a prostate that is enlarged, tense, regular and very painful.\n*Orchi-epididymitis is a rare entity in children and should be investigated for associated uropathy at a distance from the acute episode, particularly in the event of a recurrence.\n\n<br />",
