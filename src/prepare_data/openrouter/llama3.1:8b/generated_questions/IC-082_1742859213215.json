A massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. If the retina is not visible, B-ultrasound should be performed to rule out retinal detachment.\n\nThe main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:\n\n*proliferative diabetic retinopathy;\n*occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches;\n*retinal tearing, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment\n*Terson's syndrome: uni- or bilateral intravitreal haemorrhage associated with meningeal haemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome may also be associated with meningeal haemorrhage of traumatic origin).\n\n'''2. Clearly visible and abnormal fundus:''''\n\n*Occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches: This is a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and, as such, the patient should be admitted urgently to a neurovascular unit to prevent another life-threatening vascular event. It should look for carotid atheroma and embologenic heart disease. In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.\n*Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches\n*AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: this requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.\n*Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent DR is a surgical \"semi-emergency\", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.\n*Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): this must be ruled out as an emergency.\n\n'''3. Visible and normal fundus:''''\n\n*Retrobulbar optic neuritis (RORB)\n*Damage to the chiasmatic and retrochiasmatic optic tracts: sudden onset should suggest a vascular cause.",
