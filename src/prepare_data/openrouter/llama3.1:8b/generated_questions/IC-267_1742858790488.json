It is therefore \"the consequence of excess water\". It is associated with intracellular hyperhydration (ICH). The increase in intracellular volume is due to a transfer of water from the extracellular sector to the intracellular sector as a result of plasma hypo-osmolality. Hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality is explained by a relative water content higher than the sodium stock, which may be normal (pure HIC), increased (HIC + HEC = global hyperhydration) or decreased (HIC + DEC).\n*Indications for prescribing a natraemia:\n**Neurological or digestive symptoms (see clinical signs),\n**monitoring of diuretic treatment,\n**pulmonary, cerebral or endocrine pathologies associated with hyponatraemia,\n**conditions responsible for hyponatremia: heart failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.",
