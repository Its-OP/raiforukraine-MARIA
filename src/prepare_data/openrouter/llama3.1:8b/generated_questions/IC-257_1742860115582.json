Positive diagnosis: Localised oedema=\nA.    Clinical signs\n\nThey can be distinguished from generalised oedema by :\n\n*sometimes unilateral or asymmetrical;\n*less good redistribution depending on the gradient;\n*the appearance may be inflammatory, hard, painful, less well absorbed by the cup, or even cardboard-like;\n*the possible existence of ochre dermatitis, or signs of associated post-phlebitic or varicose disease.\n\nB.    Diagnosis of localised oedema\n\nQuestioning and clinical examination look for signs pointing to :\n\n*An increase in venous pressure:\n**thrombophlebitis and its after-effects;\n**Venous insufficiency (varicose disease).\n*Certain medications: mainly calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridine.\n*A lymphatic obstacle:\n**cancer (pelvic or breast) with lymph node invasion;\n** filariasis.\n*Local inflammatory pathology:\n**skin infection such as erysipelas;\n**algodystrophy;\n**insect bite, trauma, allergy, etc.\n\n=II.  Diagnosis of generalised oedema=\nA.    Clinical signs\n\nThey are frank when hydro-sodium retention is at least 3 to 5% of body weight (i.e. 2.5 to 3 litres).\n\nThey are located in the subcutaneous tissues. They are\n\n*'''bilateral and symmetrical;''''\n*'''declining''' :\n**- in orthostatism in the lower limbs, initially in the ankles where they erase the retro-malleolar groove,\n**- after a period of prolonged bed rest, they are located preferentially in the lumbar region. In young patients, palpebral and periorbital oedema is frequently observed, particularly on rising,\n*'''white, soft, painless;''''\n*'''taking the bucket''': pressure of the finger against the inside of the tibia leaves a depression ;\n\nSodium and water inflation can also lead to hydrops with associated serous effusions:\n\n*pleural effusions;\n*ascites, especially in children\n*exceptionally pericardial effusion.\n\nThe extent of the oedematous syndrome is assessed by quantifying the ''[[Weight gain SD-057|weight gain]]'''.\n\n===In favour of cardiac pathology:===\n\n*Jugular turgidity and hepato-jugular reflux: right heart failure or congestive heart failure;\n*functional signs suggestive of associated left heart failure (dyspnoea on exertion or at rest), pathology potentially responsible for heart failure (myocardial ischaemia, valvular pathology, particularly mitral or aortic), risk factors for atherosclerosis;\n*pleural effusions, mainly on the right;\n*association of pulmonary oedema.\ncardiac ultrasound (reduced ejection fraction, etc.); * electrocardiogram; * electrocardiogram;\n*electrocardiogram;\n*thoracic radiography (possible alveolar overload).\n\n<br />\n\n===In favour of liver pathology:===\n\n*ascites ;\n*alcohol intoxication;\n*known acute or chronic viral hepatitis.\n*ultrasound examination of the liver and bile ducts\n\n<br />\n\n===In favour of renal failure:===\n\n*elevated creatinine levels\n*Known glomerular disease, arterial hypertension;\n*proteinuria, haematuria (urine dipstick).\n*Ultrasound of the kidneys and urinary tract.\n*In favour of hypoalbuminemia (favouring factor):\n\n<br />\n\n===Protein synthesis deficiency:===\n- anorexia or lack of intake, , signs of Kwashiorkor\n\n- digestive disease (severe malabsorption) ;\n\n- liver disease (hepatocellular insufficiency).\n<br />\n\n===Loss of protein:===\n- known nephrotic syndrome (urine dipstick);\n\n- exudative enteropathy, cachexia (cancer) ;\n\n- Extensive burns.\n\n===In favour of idiopathic cyclic oedema:===\n\n*Cardiac, hepatic and renal pathologies have been ruled out;\n*women in active periods, rapid weight gain in a few days or during the day of 1.5 to 2 kg; they are located in a remote area and are often linked to the menstrual cycle, oliguria.\n\n<br />",
