It is characterised by an initial phase of horizontal intraepidermal spread followed by secondary vertical dermal spread.\n* Nodular melanoma (15 to 20% of cases), which initially spreads vertically and has a poor prognosis.\n* Lentiginous acral melanoma (5%): melanoma of the palms and soles.\n* Dubreuilh melanoma (10%): melanoma occurring in elderly subjects with marked helioderma, especially on the face.\n* Melanoma of the genital, ENT and oral mucosa: very rare.\n\n\n.\n\nMelanoma has a risk of :\n\n* Skin recurrence, in the form of skin or subcutaneous nodules at the initial site of the melanoma or \"in transit\" between the tumour and the first lymph node relay.\n* lymph node metastases in the homolateral drainage area of the melanoma\n* distant metastases, which generally occur after regional lymph node metastases and can affect any organ, with a predilection for the lungs, liver and brain. <br />\n\nThe international classification (AJCC 8th edition) classifies melanomas into :\n\n* Stages I and II in cases of primary melanoma of the skin without lymph node or distant recurrence\n* Stages III in the case of locoregional, cutaneous or lymph node involvement\n* Stage IV, in the presence of distant metastases. <br />\n\nThe risk of regional and distant recurrence is correlated with histoprognostic parameters such as the Breslow index and ulceration.\n\nAt the stage of lymph node involvement (stage III), the prognostic markers are the number and size of invaded lymph nodes and capsular rupture.\n\nIn stage IV, the poor prognostic factors are a high LDH level, a large tumour mass (more than 3 organs affected by metastases; more than 3 liver metastases) and symptomatic brain metastases and/or more than 3 brain metastases.",
