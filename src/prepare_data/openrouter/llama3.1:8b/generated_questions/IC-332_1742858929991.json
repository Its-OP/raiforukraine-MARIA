Discuss thrombolysis.\n\n- No acute right heart: no thrombolysis and look for another diagnosis\n\nb/ Stabilised and transportable patient: angioscanner\n\nIn the event of thrombolysis, curative anticoagulation is also necessary.\n\n\n2- Pneumothorax :\n\nExsufflation if in shock. See item 360.\n\n\n3- Pericardial tamponade :\n\nIdentified by transthoracic echocardiography. Pericardial drainage (excluding aortic dissection).",
