If the patient is relieved, they can go home. This is often the first severe migraine attack.\n\n\n- Indications for a lumbar puncture in the event of an acute headache'': this allows the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be analysed and the intracranial pressure to be measured. LP must be performed ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]) :\n\no '''Suspicion of SAH''': If the imaging is normal, an LP must be performed, even if the headache has disappeared. A xanthochromia of the supernatant ([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]]) in spectrophotometry is present in 100% of aneurysmal SAHs when the CSF is taken between 12 hours and 14 days after the onset of the headache.\n\no '''When infectious meningitis is suspected''': '''PL from the outset WITHOUT prior imaging or blood tests.''' There are few indications for brain imaging prior to LP. A blood test is carried out at the same time (blood culture and systematic blood glucose to interpret the glycorrhaphy).\n\no '''When there is a suspicion of HTIC''' and '''AFTER''' non-diagnostic brain imaging, an LP must be performed to confirm the diagnosis by measuring pressure in the left lateral decubitus position (HTIC if >25 cm of water), to look for chronic meningitis and to relieve the headache by subtracting CSF. A fundus examination will also be carried out.\n\no After imaging in all other acute headaches without a definite aetiological diagnosis after imaging ([[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination]]).\n\n.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Lumbar puncture is the key emergency test for any suspected case of infectious meningitis (severe headache + fever)''''\n|- It must be carried out within one hour of the patient's admission to the emergency department, without any prior brain imaging or biological work-up.\n\n- Isolated [[Coma and disorder of consciousness SD-028|disorder of consciousness]] is NOT a contraindication to LP.\n\n- Indications for brain imaging prior to LP are rare\n\n- If an LP cannot be performed as quickly as possible, dexamethasone and antibiotics should be started immediately after a pair of blood cultures have been taken.\n|-\n|LP is NOT contraindicated if\n|- [[Coma and disturbed consciousness SD-028|Disturbed consciousness]] isolated\n\n- Taking anti-platelet agents\n|-\n|LP is contraindicated if\n\n\u00e8 '''LP performed as soon as the contraindication is lifted'''\n|- Extensive cutaneous infection of the puncture site\n\n- Haemodynamic or respiratory instability\n\n- Known haemostasis disorders (coagulopathy including haemophilia, platelets < 50,000/mm3)\n\n- Effective anticoagulant treatment (heparin, VKA or direct oral anticoagulants)\n\n- Spontaneous bleeding suggestive of DIC\n|-\n|If meningitis is suspected, the indications for imaging before LP are limited.\n\n\u00e8 '''LP performed after imaging if possible'''\n|\n\n\n- Signs suggestive of an expansive process: signs of localisation and/or recent focal epileptic seizures\n\n- '''Signs of cerebral involvement''': [[Coma and disorders of consciousness SD-028|troubles de la vigilanc]]<nowiki/>e AND pupillary abnormalities, dysautonomia, posterior tonic seizures, areactivity, decerebration or decortication reaction\n\n- '''[[Convulsions SD-120|Crises convulsives]] persistence'''\n<br />\n|}\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''LCS'''\n|'''Normal'''\n|'''HSA'''\n|'''Infectious meningitis''''\n|-\n|'''Appearance before centrifugation'''\n|Clear, rock water\n|Hemorrhagic and bloodless\n\nYellow after a few days\n|Blue or clear\n|-\n|Leukocytes\n|0 to 5/mm<sup>3</sup>\n<br />Sometimes increased\n|Sometimes increased\n<br />Sometimes increased\n|> 10 mm<sup>3</sup>\n<br />\n|-\n|Red blood cells\n|Absence\n|Very high\n|Absence\n|-\n|Proteinorachy\n|< 0.40-0.45 g/L adult\n|Increased\n|Increased or normal\n|-\n|Glycorrhaphy\n|> \u2154 blood glucose\n|Normal\n|Lowered or normal\n|-\n|'''Pigments'''\n|Absent\n|Xantochromia of supernatant\n\nBiliary pigments\n|Absents\n|}\n'''Paediatric specificity''''\n\nNormal CSF opening pressure < 28 cm H2O in children",
