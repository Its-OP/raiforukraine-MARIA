Similarly, it is important not to list all the possible complications and disabilities that may be seen as inescapable, without overlooking the difficulties. It is preferable to focus as much as possible on relatively short-term objectives and to value the child's skills.\n\nIt is important to put the child and not the disease first. The child is a carrier of a genetic disease.\n\nIt is impossible to predict the evolutionary trajectory of a child with a genetic disease. In fact, there are varying degrees of variability depending on the disease. Some parents are interested in the existence of parents' associations.\n\nFinally, in very rare cases, some parents will ask for the child to be put up for adoption.",
