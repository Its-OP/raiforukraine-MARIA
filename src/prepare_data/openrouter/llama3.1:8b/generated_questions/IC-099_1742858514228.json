Treatment of the migraine attack</u>'''\n\n- '''Molecules of proven efficacy''<nowiki>: non-specific treatments (paracetamol, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and specific treatments (triptans) (table). (</nowiki>[[Prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249|prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]; [[Prescribing analgesics SD-250|prescribing analgesics]])\n\n- Paracetamol, often used as a self-medication, is only effective for mild to moderate attacks.\n\n- NSAIDs: Ibuprofen and ketoprofen have marketing authorisation for the treatment of migraine attacks. Naproxen, diclofenac and indometacin have also been shown to be effective.\n\n- Triptans: Specific anti-migraine drugs. These serotonin 5HT1B/1D receptor agonists are vasoconstrictors and are contraindicated in patients with a history of vascular disease. The dosage is one unit at the start of an attack, to be repeated in the event of a recurrence (maximum 2 per day).\n\n- '''Metoclopramide''': relieves digestive problems in cases of nausea/vomiting.\n\n- Do not prescribe opiates because of the risk of drug abuse, addiction and increased digestive problems. Avoid combined analgesics (caffeine) as they increase the risk of drug abuse.  \n\n'''Recommended treatments for migraine attacks.'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''Undesirable effects'''\n|'''Main'''\n\n'''contraindications'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''Aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs'''\n|-\n|<nowiki>- Aspirin 1000 mg</nowiki>\n\n- Acetylsalicylic acid 900 mg + metoclopramide 10 mg (Migpriv\u00ae)\n\n- Ibuprofen 400 mg\n\n- Ketoprofen 75-150 mg (max 200 mg/d)\n<br />\n|Digestive disorders, haemorrhage\n\nAllergy or asthma triggered by aspirin or NSAIDs\n|Peptic ulcer disease in progress\n\nPregnancy > 24 SA\n\nMetoclopramide: <12 years, history of neuroleptic dyskinesia\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''Triptans: maximum 2 units/d''''\n|-\n|Almotriptan (12.5 mg cp)\n\nEletriptan (cp 20 or 40 mg)\n\nFrovatriptan (cp 2.5 mg)\n\nNaratriptan (cp 2.5mg)\n\nRizatriptan (cp 5 or 10 mg; orodispersible 10 mg)\n\nSumatriptan (cp 50 mg, nasal spray 20 and 10 mg, SC injection [not reimbursed])\n\nZolmitriptan (2.5 mg tablet; orodispersible tablet)\n|Nausea, dizziness, drowsiness\n\nHeaviness, pain or pressure in the chest, neck or limbs\n\nPalpitations, tachycardia\n\n\nCoronary spasm (exceptional)\n|Coronary artery disease, ischaemic arterial disease, uncontrolled hypertension\n\nStroke or TIA\n<br />\n|}\n\n- '''Prescription and advice''' [[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|(writing a prescription/medical letter]]; [[Explaining a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explaining a treatment to the patient]])\n\no Advise taking it \"early\", within one hour of the onset of the mild to moderate headache, for no more than 8 days a month (to prevent drug abuse).\n\no ''If paracetamol fails, prescribe a triptan and an NSAID on the same prescription'', depending on the drugs already tried and the patient's preferences, and explain the ''strategy''.\n\n\u00a7 Mild crisis'': take the NSAID then the triplan if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.\n\n\u00a7 '''Moderate crisis''' '''or severe crisis''': take triptan then NSAID if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.\n\n\u00a7 Seizure with aura: take the NSAID as soon as the aura starts and the triptan as soon as the headache starts.\n\no Prescribe a combination of paracetamol and metoclopramide to patients with a contraindication to or intolerance of NSAIDs, aspirin and triptans.\n\no Prescribe metoclopramide (oral, rectal or injectable) for digestive disorders\n\n- '''Follow-up and optimisation of crisis treatment (after at least 3 crises)''' '''<u>2.  Background treatment of migraine</u>'''\n\n- '''Traditional oral treatments:''' several have proven efficacy in episodic migraine, with a high level of evidence (amitriptyline, flunarizine, metoprolol, pizotifen, propranolol, topiramate and sodium valproate) or a lower level of evidence (lisinopril, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, timolol, oxetorone, venlafaxine). Only topiramate has proven efficacy in the prevention of chronic migraine.\n\n- Antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway'': three anti-CGRP antibodies injected SC have marketing authorisation in France for the prophylaxis of migraine with at least 8 migraine days per month and failure of at least 2 prior disease-modifying treatments. They can only be prescribed by a neurologist. In 2021, these costly treatments were not yet reimbursed.\n\n- Botulinum toxin: proven effective in chronic migraine, but not episodic migraine. Approved after failure of at least two disease-modifying treatments, as an alternative to anti-CGRP antibodies. It will be administered in hospital only.\n\n\n- '''Indication for background treatment:''' Determined on the basis of patient preferences, the diary, any criteria for severe migraine and chronic migraine, and the impact assessed using the HIT-6 and HAD scales. It is ''recommended to initiate a background treatment'' in patients with frequent and/or disabling attacks, and in all patients.\n\no Using seizure medication 8 days or more per month for > 3 months\n\no Having severe migraine according to French definition criteria\n\no Having chronic migraine according to ICHD-3 criteria\n\no With a HIT-6 score of 60 or more\n\no Having disabling migraine attacks despite optimised crisis treatment\n\n\n- '''Objectives of background treatment to be explained to the patient'''\n\no The aim is to reduce monthly headache days by 50% in episodic migraine and 30% in chronic migraine.\n\no Efficacy is assessed during the 3rd month of treatment.\n\no Failure of disease-modifying therapy may be due to ineffectiveness and/or intolerance.\n\n\n- '''Prescription of the first background treatment:''' Start at a low dose and gradually increase to reach the optimal daily dose, taking into account the side-effects.\n\no Explain that compliance is vital and encourage once-daily dosing if possible.\n\no ''Episodic migraine'': ''propranolol'' or ''metoprolol'' as first-line treatment and where beta-blockers, amitriptyline, candesartan or topiramate are contraindicated.\n\no ''Chronic migraine: topiramate'' as first-line treatment, specialist advice is recommended.\n\no ''Chronic migraine'' with a ''drug-induced headache''.\n\n\u00a7 Prescribe a first-line background treatment\n\n\u00a7 Advise the patient to wean off the over-used medication on an outpatient basis.\n\n\u00a7 Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, with advice to aim for 8 days of treatment per month.\n\n- '''Assessment and monitoring of background treatment:'''\n\no Seizure diary and HIT-6 scale to assess the effectiveness of background treatment, which must be taken regularly for 3 months before being evaluated.\n\no If effective, it is continued for 6 to 18 months.\n\no If this fails, a new treatment should be tried. The choice of drug depends on the patient's condition, co-morbidity and the severity of the migraine, taking into account the benefit/risk balance.\n\no ''After failure of two disease-modifying treatments'', specialist advice is recommended (neurologist).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |'''Basic first-line migraine treatments'''\n|-\n|'''Molecule'''\n\n'''(therapeutic class)'''\n|'''Daily dose'''\n\n'''Minimal-Maximal'''\n\n'''(Average)'''\n|'''Main adverse reactions'''\n|'''Main contraindications'''\n|-\n|'''Amitriptyline'''\n\n'''(anti'''\n\n'''tricyclic depressant)'''\n|10-100 mg (25 mg)\n\nOne at dinner\n|Dry mouth, drowsiness, weight gain\n|Absent: glaucoma, prostate adenoma\n\nRelative: obesity\n|-\n|Propranolol\n\n'''(beta-blocker)''''\n|20-240 mg (80 mg)\n\nTaken twice a day or once in the morning (LP form).\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Frequent: asthenia, exercise intolerance\n\nRare: depression\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Absolute: asthma, heart failure, atrioventricular block, bradycardia\n\nPrecaution: depression\n|-\n|Metoprolol\n\n'''(beta-blocker)''''\n|50-200 mg (100 mg)\n\nOne dose in the morning (LP form)\n|-\n|Candesartan\n\n'''(angiotensin II receptor antagonist)''''\n<br />\n|8-32 mg (16 mg)\n\nOne or two intakes/day\n|Hypotension\n|Absolute: heart failure, renal artery stenosis, renal insufficiency, pregnancy\n\nRelative: hypotension\n|-\n|Topiramate\n\n'''(antiepilep-''''\n\n'''tique)'''\n|50-200 mg (100 mg)\n\nOne or two doses/day\n|Frequent: paresthesias, weight loss, cognitive problems (lack of words), depression\n\nRare: renal lithiasis, acute myopia with acute angle glaucoma\n|Abnormal: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, glaucoma, metformin use, hepatic or renal insufficiency, renal lithiasis.\n\nRelative: depression, suicidal ideation\n|}\n- '''Non-drug background treatment: '''\n\no '''Physical exercise''''\n\no '''Acupuncture''''\n\no '''Psycho-behavioural treatments'''\n\n\n'''<u>3.
