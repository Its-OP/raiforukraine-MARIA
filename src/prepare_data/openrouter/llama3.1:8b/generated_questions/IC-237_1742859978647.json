They classically occur in young subjects (adolescents, young adults) and on healthy hearts.\n* They are manifested by :\n** palpitations (sometimes with cervical beats)\n** sudden onset and abrupt cessation\n** of variable duration\n** a sensation of ''regular'' tachycardia\n** with '''post-critical polyuria'''\n** stopped by vagal manoeuvres or injection of adenosine'' or 5'-adenosine triphosphorus\n* The ECG shows :\n** per-critical: a ''regular tachycardia, most often with fine QRS'', with retrograde atrial activity (negative in the lower leads) sometimes invisible or hidden in the repolarisation\n** outside palpitations: normal pattern or indicative of ventricular pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)\n\n[[File:Junctional Tachycardia 2.png|centric|thumb|900x900px|Tachycardia (150/min), regular, fine QRS with retrograde P' wave (negative in DII hidden in repolarization \u2198\ufe0f)]]\n<br />",
