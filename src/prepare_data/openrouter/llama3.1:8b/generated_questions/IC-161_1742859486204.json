It is also known as febrile renal colic (if painful).\n*ESBL risk factors: ESBL colonisation < 3 months, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or C2-3G < 3 months, fluoroquinolone < 3 months, hospitalisation < 3 months, living in a long-stay institution, travel to an ESBL-endemic area (southern Europe, Mediterranean basin, Middle East, India, south-east Asia).\n\n\n'''<u>PNA at risk of complication</u>''''\n\n.
