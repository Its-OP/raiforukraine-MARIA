Precursors of nitrosamines, they can be carcinogenic.\n* Phosphates from agricultural activities and urban waste. They play a part in the eutrophication process, leading to the development of algae that produce toxins.\n* Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium), which are deposited in river and coastal sediments.  They can concentrate in aquatic flora and fauna, a source of poisoning for humans.\n* Dangers associated with mineral salt imbalances due to natural contamination or disruption caused by man-made additions.\n* Organic pollution linked to human activities, detergents, solvents, hydrocarbons, medicines, etc.\n\n- Microbial and parasitic pollution :\n\n* Fecal, human and animal origin linked to the absence or inadequate treatment of drinking water.\n\nThe most well-known and frequent are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n* Bacteria: salmonella, shigella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae\n* Viruses: enterovirus, coxackie, echovirus, hepatitis A and E, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, etc., causing gastroenteritis, hepatitis and neuromeningeal disorders.\n* Parasites: Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp.\n* In certain uses of water, water microorganisms can become pathogenic: Legionella pneumophila, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium xenopi).\n\nReference Hartemann P Sciences Eaux et Territoires 2013 n\u00b010 p14 \u00e0 21 Eau de consommation, risque sant\u00e9.",
