It allows :\n\n- in the acute phase, to reduce oedema and pain.\n\n- outside the acute phase, compression (mainly socks) can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome and is indicated for a minimum of 6 months, after which it should be reassessed\n\nElastic compression should not be used if the ankle systolic pressure index is < 0.60.",
