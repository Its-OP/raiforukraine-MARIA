In France, half of premature births are due to spontaneous prematurity (spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membranes) and the other half to induced prematurity.\n\nSpontaneous prematurity occurs after spontaneous labour with intact membranes ('''[[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman]], [[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]''') or after premature rupture of the membranes ('''[[Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109|Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman]'''). Induced prematurity is linked to a foetal or maternal pathology leading voluntarily to birth through medical intervention.\n\nThe main causes of induced prematurity are pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]] and [[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''), IUGR, [[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|'''Hypertension during pregnancy'''',Retroplacental haematoma]] and maternal pathologies requiring the birth of the child (respiratory insufficiency [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|''Acute respiratory distress''',]] decompensated heart disease, etc.).).\n\nPatients with preterm rupture of membranes may also have an induced delivery if the condition of the newborn or the mother requires induction of labour or a caesarean section. There are many risk factors for spontaneous prematurity.\n\n\n'''Risk factors:''''\n\n- Socio-demographic risk factors:''\n\nSingle, low socio-economic level ''[[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|Precarious social situation and isolation]]''', inconsistent follow-up\n\nTobacco (''''[[Tobacco risk prevention SD-314|Tobacco risk prevention]]'''), alcohol, drugs\n\nStress, ''[[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]]''', depression, prolonged standing job\n\nHistory of premature delivery and late miscarriage\n\nShort interval between last two pregnancies\n\nIVF ('''[[Difficulty having children SD-033|Difficulty having children]]''')\n\n\n- Risk factors for prematurity linked to the uterine environment\n\no Amnio-chorion infection\n\nIn the event of early premature rupture of the membranes (''[[Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109|Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman]]''), the risk of amnio-chorion infection is greatly increased.\n\no Uterine malformations (''''[[Discovery of a genital tract malformation SD-105|Discovery of a genital tract malformation]]''')\n\no Cervico-isthmic incompetence (classically defined as a functional mechanical disorder of the cervix resulting in late miscarriage)\n\no Conization\n\no Placental anomaly (placenta inserted low)\n\no Breakthrough bleeding\n\n\n- Risk factors for prematurity intrinsic to pregnancy\n\no Multiple pregnancies\n\no Hydramnios\n\no Placenta praevia\n\no Gravidic vascular pathologies",
