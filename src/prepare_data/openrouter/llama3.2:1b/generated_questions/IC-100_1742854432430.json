Progressive onset (sometimes abrupt). With [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]] (inconstant; effortless, in spurts and temporarily relieves the headache). The headache precedes disorders of vigilance ([[Coma and disorders of consciousness SD-028|obnubilation, confusion, then coma]]). Other: [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]] horizontal (VI uni or bilateral), visual eclipses (transient bilateral amaurosis, late). Bilateral papilledema at the fundus. Infant: fontanel bulge, increased PC.\n\no Risk: commitment\n\no Causes: intracranial tumour ('''<u>item 299</u>'''), pituitary adenoma ('''<u>item 244</u>'''), chronic subdural haematoma ('''<u>item 344</u>'''), hydrocephalus, cerebral venous thrombosis, chronic meningitis, rarely idiopathic HTIC (young, obese woman, no cause on imaging and LP)\n\n\n- '''Intracranial hypotension syndromes'''\n\no ''Post-dural puncture headache'': a few hours after an iatrogenic dural breach (LP, epidural, spinal anaesthesia, etc.), progressive (sometimes sudden). Postural orthostatic headache which appears when standing or sitting, and disappears in less than 15 minutes when lying flat without a cushion. With [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], sometimes [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], [[Neck pain SD-144|cervicalgia]] (in standing position).\n\no ''Spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache'': orthostatic postural headache in the absence of iatrogenic dural rupture\n\n\n- '''Acute post-traumatic headache:''' by definition appears less than 7 days after a head injury and may resemble a migraine or tension headache. The possibility of a more serious secondary headache (extradural haematoma, subdural haematoma cervical artery dissection) must be systematically raised and ruled out by appropriate imaging ('''<u>item 334</u>''').\n\n- '''Giant cell arteritis''' ('''<u>item 195</u>''''): any unusual headache in a subject >50 years of age should raise the suspicion of giant cell arteritis (Horton's disease), even in the absence of the classic picture (AEG, limb-girdle pain, bitemporal pain, indurated, warm, non-throbbing temporal artery, jaw claudication).\n\n\n- '''Acute blocked sinusitis''' ('''<u>item 148</u>'''): intense, progressive or sometimes brutal headache, increased by tilting the head, decubitus and/or pressure on the sinus regions. Pain is sometimes isolated, without nasal discharge (blocked sinusitis); [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|fever]] is inconstant.\n\n\n- '''Acute angle-closure glaucoma''' ('''<u>item 84</u>'''): severe periorbital pain, with ocular redness, unilateral visual disturbance (decreased acuity, light halos) and sometimes moderate areactive mydriasis.\n\n\n- '''Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning''' ('''<u>item 337</u>'''): progressive headache then dizziness, visual disturbances, asthenia, [[Vertigo and dizzy sensation SD-064|ebriety sensation]], consciousness disturbances, in a winter context, defective combustion heating system.\n\n\n- ''Drug-induced headache'': headache resembling migraine or tension headache, but temporally related to the intake of a headache-inducing treatment (frequently: phosphodiesterase inhibitors).\n\n\n- '''General headache:''' headache without specific features, diagnosis guided by the other signs and symptoms of the causative conditions.\n\no Sleep apnoea syndrome (''<u>item 110</u>''')\n\no Anaemia (''<u>item 213</u>''')\n\no Hypothyroidism (''<u>item 243</u>''')\n\n\n'''Paediatric specificity'''\n\nTumours in young children are more often cerebellar than supratentorial - walking and balance must be carefully examined - headaches are delayed or the child gets used to them and no longer complains.\n\nIdiopathic HTIC exists in children",
