Three types of CI are classically distinguished:\n\n\u00d8 ''Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF \u226440%)'' caused by failure of myocardial contraction.\n\n\u00d8 ''Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%'' generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.\n\n\u00d8 '''Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction LVEF \u226550%.''' This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).\n\n\nThis definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF \u226440%).\n\n\n[[File:Figure 1.png|centred|thumb|600x600px|LVEF calculation : Top: LVEF formula and the 3 limits used for the types of CI.
