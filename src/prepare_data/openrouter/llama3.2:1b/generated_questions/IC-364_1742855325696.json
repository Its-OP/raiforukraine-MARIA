Plastic deformation of the bones is also one of the forms encountered at this age.\n\nIn children, the most common fractures are epiphyseal dislocations, green wood fractures and metaphyseal fractures.\n\nIn adolescents, the fractures encountered are type III or IV epiphyseal dislocations, apophyseal fracture-avulsions and complete fractures.",
