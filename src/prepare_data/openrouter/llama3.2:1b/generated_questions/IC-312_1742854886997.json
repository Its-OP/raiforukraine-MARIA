Microbiopsies are usually performed under ultrasound guidance (ultrasound mass) and macrobiopsies are usually performed under stereotaxis (mammographic microcalcification focus). Macrobiopsies may also be performed under MRI when the lesion classified as Bi-rads 4 or 5 is not visible on mammography or ultrasound. The biopsy is used to confirm the histological diagnosis and assess a number of prognostic factors.\n\nCytology samples are not recommended for a mass or a focus of microcalcifications. However, cytology of a suspicious axillary adenopathy or of a nipple discharge in the case of a suspicious discharge (bloody +++) may be useful.\n\nFinally, in the event of radio-clinical discordance ''or if it is impossible to reach the lesion (focus of deep microcalcifications in a small breast)'', a surgical biopsy may exceptionally be indicated.",
