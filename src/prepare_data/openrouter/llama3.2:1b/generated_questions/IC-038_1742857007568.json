Fertility therefore represents reality and a couple is said to be fertile if they have had a child. The ''fertility rate'' is a demographic parameter defined as the ratio of the number of live births in a given year to the total female population of childbearing age (average number of women aged between 15 and 50 over the year).\n\n== Fertility ==\nFertility'' is the probability of a pregnancy occurring in the course of a month or a menstrual cycle in a couple not using contraception.",
