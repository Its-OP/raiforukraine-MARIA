Active on the liver, reduces hepatic glucose production, in particular hepatic gluconeogenesis (uncertain effect on the intestine). Frequent digestive side effects. Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and <u>formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min</u>. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n* Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (sulphonylureas): Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc). They are associated with '''glinides''' (<u>repaglinide</u>) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: <u>hypoglycaemia</u> and weight gain [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics variable depending on the molecule and <u>therefore variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides</u>. <u>No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.</u>\n\n* '''Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (colloquially DPP4, family: \"gliptins\").''' Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). <u>Posology to be adjusted to renal function.</u> Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.\n\n* '''GLP1 receptor agonists (colloquially GLP1 agonists).''' Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. <Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia.</u> Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.\n\n* '''Intestinal alphaglucosidase inhibitor,''' only representative: <u>acarbose</u>. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.\n\n* '''SGLT2 inhibitors.''' Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. <u>Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects [[Adult heart failure]] [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]</u>. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation. Can be prescribed up to a GFR of 25 ml/min.",
