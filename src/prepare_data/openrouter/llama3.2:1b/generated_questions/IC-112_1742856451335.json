'''''\n\n''''' There are two places in the skin where a bubble can form:''''' a bubble is intra-epidermal when the cleavage occurs in the epidermis (roof and floor of the bubble in the epidermis) and a bubble is sub-epidermal when there is a cleavage under the epidermis (roof of the bubble consisting of the entire epidermis and floor in the dermis).\n\nThe subepidermal bulla is usually taut and the intraepidermal bulla is flaccid and fragile.\n\nAutoimmune bullous dermatosis is a disease defined by the presence of immunoglobulins deposited at the dermo-epidermal junction or on the surface of keratinocytes. It is characterised by cutaneous lesions, most often bullous, on the skin or mucous membranes.",
