They are linked to :\n**Uncompensated water loss of :\n***Extrarenal \"insensitive\" (the renal response here is normal, urine is concentrated (U/P osm > 1) and there is no polyuria):\n****cutaneous: heat stroke, burn;\n****respiratory: polypnoea, prolonged hyperventilation, hyperthermia;\n****digestive: osmotic diarrhoea.\n***Renal: Hypotonic polyuria (U/P osm \u2264 1) with plasma hyperosmolality, characteristic of diabetes insipidus (Table 4). Induced polyuria is compensated by polydipsia (polyuro-polydipsic syndrome), hypernatremia occurs when the patient has reduced access to water:\n****to diabetes insipidus of central origin linked to the complete or partial absence of ADH secretion\n****nephrogenic diabetes insipidus characterised by a reduced or abolished renal response to ADH. Urinary osmolality is low and unaffected by the administration of synthetic ADH (dDAVP= minirin\u00ae).\n**A deficit in water intake:\n***hypothalamic abnormalities: primary hypodipsia\n***lack of free access to water: infants, dependent elderly subjects, comatose patients (stroke)\n***lack of water (desert areas)\n*'''''Extracellular hyperhydration and intracellular dehydration'': '''Massive sodium intake'''''\n**especially in children, when hypertonic bicarbonate solution is used or after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n**NaCl poisoning",
