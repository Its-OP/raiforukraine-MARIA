The drop in cardiac output results in hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia, leading to failure of the peripheral organs concerned (kidney, liver, brain).\n\n- The usual clinical definition includes: systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, urine output < 30mL/h or cold extremities, cardiac index < 2.2 l/min/m\u00b2 with capillary pressure > 15 mmHg.\n\n- The leading cause of cardiogenic shock is myocardial infarction",
  "question": {
    "question": "What is the definition of cardiogenic shock?",
    "option_a": "A sudden and severe failure of the heart to pump blood effectively, leading to hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia.",
    "option_b": "A condition where the heart is not pumping blood efficiently, but it is not the primary cause of cardiogenic shock.",
    "option_c": "A condition where the heart is pumping blood at a very slow rate, leading to hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia.",
    "option_d": "A sudden and severe failure of the heart to pump blood effectively, leading to hypotension and tissue anoxia.",
    "correct_option": "A sudden and severe failure of the heart to pump blood effectively, leading to hypoperfusion and tissue anoxia."
