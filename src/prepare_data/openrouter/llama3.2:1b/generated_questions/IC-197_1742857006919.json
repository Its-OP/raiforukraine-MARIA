Conventional radiography'''\n\nX-rays of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine from the front and in profile, and of the pelvis from the front, as well as X-rays of painful areas, are necessary.\n\n- Enthesophyte = cicatricial ossification along a peripheral enthesis (the calcaneal spur is the best known). This lesion is not specific to spondyloarthritis and can be seen in mechanical overstress.\n\n- Syndesmophyte = Ossification of a vertebral enthesis. Specific to spondyloarthritis. Differs from an osteophyte in that it is fine rather than coarse, and in its vertical direction. It forms slowly and may result in the fusion of two vertebrae.\n\n'''. Other imaging techniques\n\nIn the case of sacroiliitis on standard radiography, MRI of the sacroiliac joint and spine is of no diagnostic value. '''([[178.

Discovery of a bone and joint anomaly on medical imaging examination]])'''\n\nMRI of the sacroiliac joints (or even the spine) may be useful in cases of diagnostic doubt.\n\nUltrasound and scintigraphy are rarely used for diagnostic purposes.\n\n'''. Other complementary examinations'''\n\n- CRP or SV: 60% of patients with untreated spondyloarthritis do not have elevated CRP or SV. However, a significant rise in CRP should prompt a search for an associated tumour or infectious disease. '''([[203. Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP)])''''\n\n- Testing for HLA B27: useful for diagnosis in doubtful cases.\n\n- Respiratory function tests in advanced diseases (assessment of restrictive impairment and fibrosis).\n\n- Electrocardiogram: detects conduction disorders (AVB).
