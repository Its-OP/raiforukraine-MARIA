A distinction is made between vesiculo-pustular exanthemas (chickenpox, for example) and erythematous exanthemas (redness due to cutaneous vasodilation). (see sheet 114)\n\nThere are two clinical types of erythematous exanthema:\n\n- macular exanthemas with no interval of healthy skin (also known as scarlatiniform exanthemas) as in scarlet fever\n\n- maculopapular exanthems with patches of healthy skin (also known as morbilliform exanthems), as in measles.
