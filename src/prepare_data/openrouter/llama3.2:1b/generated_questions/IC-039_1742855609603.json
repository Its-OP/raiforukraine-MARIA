It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196\u00b0C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196\u00b0C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196\u00b0C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",
