Gastrointestinal disorders (microbial and parasitic pollution)\n\n2.     Neurological damage (microbial pollution: Salmonella typhi, Clostridium botulinum)\n\n3.     Hepatitis (HAV, HEV)\n\n4.     Renal failure, Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) ('Enterohaemorrhagic E.coli', 'Shigella')\n\n5.     Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, Shigella)\n\n6.     Shock (toxins)\n\n7.     Endocrine disruption (pesticides)\n\n8.     Cancers (bladder, skin, lung, colorectal: linked to disinfectants, pesticides (chlordecone, DDT), arsenic, etc.)\n\n9.     Methaemoglobinaemia (nitrites)\n\n10.   Dental fluorosis (natural increase in water concentration or disruption of artificial water fluoridation)\n\n11.   Lead poisoning\n\n12.   Minamata disease (Mercury)\n\nTheir prevention is based on programmes to monitor the state of the water.",
