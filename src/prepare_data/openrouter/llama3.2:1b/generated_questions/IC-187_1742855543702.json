This oedema is transient, receding within 72 hours without scarring, and most often occurs in areas rich in mast cells: the face, extremities and external genitalia.\nIn the case of anaphylaxis, the oedema may be of laryngeal or pharyngeal origin, which may affect the prognosis.\n\n'''Superficial urticaria is isolated in 50% of cases.'''\n\n'''Superficial urticaria is associated with deep urticaria in 40% of cases.'''\n\n'''Deep urticaria is isolated in 10% of cases.'''\n\n<br />",
