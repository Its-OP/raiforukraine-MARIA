Before 6 months, the mechanism is essentially reflex.\n\nRepeated retention of stool in the rectal ampulla leads to constipation. This is terminal retention.\n\nOther mechanisms may contribute to functional constipation:\n\n- Lack of water or fibre intake\n\n- Exclusive lacto-meal diet\n\nThe organic origin is explained by different mechanisms, depending on the cause:\n\n- Absence of colonic contraction\n\n- Ionic disorders\n\n- Medicines\n\n- Insufficient thrust\n\n- Hypertonia of the sphincter\n\n- Anal obstruction",
