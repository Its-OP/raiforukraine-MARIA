Verification of hypotheses through investigation. For communities with less than 30 exposed people, a cohort study is carried out. For communities > 30, a case-control study.\n\n2) '''A microbiological investigation''' :\n\nSamples taken from the presumed source (communities must keep a control meal from the previous 3 days) for microbiological and toxicological analysis.\n\nSampling of pathological products from affected patients (stools, vomit, blood, etc.)\n\n3) '''A health survey'''\n\nProduction, transport and storage of raw materials\n\nFood preparation, transport, maintaining the cold chain\n\nSanitary condition of food preparation and storage premises\n\nControl of catering staff",
