DCs are usually very effective in the short term against AD flare-ups. Long-term efficacy studies are very rare. DCs are classified according to their potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak activity) and their galenic form (cream, ointment, lotion and gel).\n\n\n'''The choice of a DC depends on four criteria: age, location of lesions, extent to be treated and oozing nature of lesions.'''\n\n\n<u>choice of galenical</u>:\n\n-ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas\n\n-cream for oozing areas, folds and large skin surfaces\n\n-lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children)\n\n- scalp gel (rarely used in children)\n\n<u>The choice of activity level</u>\n\n-Very strong DCs are contraindicated on infants and young children, and on the face, folds and seat.\n\nHigh-activity CDs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated in children on lichenified lesions, on the extremities and on lesions resistant to moderate-activity CDs.      \n\nModerate-activity CDs are used on the face and body of infants and children.\n\nlow-activity CDs are of no interest because they have little or no efficacy.\n\nnumber of applications per day\n\nA single application per day is just as effective as several applications, and makes it easier to adhere to treatment.  \n\n<u>quantity to be applied</u>\n\nThere is no maximum quantity recommended during the initial treatment.\n\nThe amount required to maintain remission during maintenance treatment should not normally exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity CD for children and 60 g/month of high-activity CD for adults.\n\nDuring the maintenance period, it has been shown in children and adults that the systematic use of a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on the skin areas usually affected for 4 months reduced the number of flare-ups without side-effects. This method of using DCs (pro-active treatment) is particularly suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups that recur rapidly when DCs are stopped.\n<br />\n\n=== 3) Emollients ===\nEmollients improve the functional signs of skin dryness and some of them temporarily restore the skin's barrier function.\n\nThe use of emollients is recommended by professional agreement from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as a maintenance treatment throughout the duration of AD, regardless of its severity.\n\nprecautions for use:\n\ninterruption for a few days during a highly inflammatory flare-up (frequently poor tolerance)\n\n-Galenics to be adapted to the patient's preferences\n\nFragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitisation. ATTENTION: emollients are not reimbursed by the health insurance scheme, with the exception of atopiclair\u00ae, generics of dexeryl\u00a9 (reimbursable at 15%) and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.\n<br />\n\n=== 4) Therapeutic education ===\nThe aim of therapeutic education is to teach patients how to live optimally with a chronic disease. It is a process integrated into care, adapted to the patient's needs, which includes a range of information and learning techniques provided by one or more carers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, .....) during programmes involving consultation(s) and/or meetings in small groups. The aim is to help patients and/or their families become more independent, to encourage them to adhere to treatment and to combat corticophobia, which is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\nOther treatments :\n\noral antihistamines (anti-H1): no proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase apart from an old study / interest in hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during the flare-up period in young children with sleep disorders\n\n\n-Topical immunomodulator: tacrolimus (in France) - indicated for flare-ups of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (facial lesions++).\n\n\n-Systemic treatments: treatment of severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated (risk of rebound on discontinuation).  ",
