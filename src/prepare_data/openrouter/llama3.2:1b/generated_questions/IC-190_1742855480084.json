    "question": "What is the main difference between prolonged fever and repeated fevers?",
    "option_a": "Prolonged fever is characterized by a single episode of high temperature, while repeated fevers are marked by a series of episodes.",
    "option_b": "Repeated fevers are caused by a viral infection, whereas prolonged fever is caused by a bacterial infection.",
    "option_c": "Prolonged fever is typically associated with a free interval between episodes, whereas repeated fevers are often accompanied by associated respiratory signs.",
    "option_d": "Repeated fevers are more common in adults, whereas prolonged fever is more common in children.",
