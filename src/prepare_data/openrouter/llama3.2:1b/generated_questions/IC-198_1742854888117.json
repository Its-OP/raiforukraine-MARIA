After several years, gout can affect the upper limbs and even the spine, hip and shoulder.\n\nChronic arthropathy may develop. It is characterised by chronic mechanical pain interspersed with inflammatory attacks, and is particularly marked by the presence of tophus visible under the skin.\n\nThe tophi are located around the affected joints, but also in elective sites: pinna or helix (cartilaginous area) of the ear, elbows (olecranon bursitis), calcaneal and patellar tendons, distal interphalangeal joints or fingertips in patients on diuretics.\n\nManagement must take comorbidities into account +++.",
