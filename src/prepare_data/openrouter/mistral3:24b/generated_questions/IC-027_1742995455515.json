The effect of smoking requires the interaction of multiple factors: socio-demographic, epidemiological or genetic.\n\nTobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 toxic products, some of which are metabolised by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase. The genes encoding these two enzymes have been studied in mothers who smoke. In the group of low-weight children, more patients were found to have a polymorphism in one or other of these two genes.\n\nAmong the toxic substances, nicotine is the most addictive. There is a dose effect between maternal smoking and foetal impairment. However, the effect of smoking seems to be more marked in the 3rd<sup>trimester</sup> of pregnancy, since patients who successfully stop smoking in the 1st<sup>trimester</sup> and 2nd<sup>trimester have newborns whose birth weight is hardly any different from that of non-smoking mothers.\n\n'''312.
