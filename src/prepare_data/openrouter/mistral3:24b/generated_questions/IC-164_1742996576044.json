The erythema is accompanied by mucosal involvement (enanthema) with ''exfoliative glossitis'' (tongue initially sandy, then depilated (V-lingual), then raspberry) and angina.\n[[File:Scarlet fever.jpg|neant|thumb]]\n[[File:17 scarlatina.jpg|neant|vignette]]\n                     \n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nComplications and referral\n\nComplications are the same as those of GAS angina: loco-regional complications (rare), post-infectious complications (acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), which have all but disappeared in France and in high-income countries.\n\nTreatment is the same as for GAS angina: antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin for 6 days, symptomatic analgesic treatment avoiding NSAIDs + preventive measures (see above).",
