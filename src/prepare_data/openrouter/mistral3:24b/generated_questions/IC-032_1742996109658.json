A second complete and detailed clinical examination must be carried out during the stay in the maternity unit, compulsorily before the 8th<sup> day</sup> of life. The examination is recorded in the health record and the paediatrician draws up the first health certificate (certificate of the 8th</sup> day). The examination takes place in the presence of at least one of the two parents, in suitable conditions (well-lit room, suitable temperature, away from food, compliance with hygiene rules).\n\n# '''General appearance''' - temperature (36.5\u00b0C-37.5\u00b0C); - birth measurements (weight, height and head circumference with determination of trophicity) '''([[Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth SD-026|Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]])''''; - inspection : colouring (bright pink or even erythrosic, with the exception of the extremities which may remain cyanic), position at rest (quadriflexion), spontaneous gesticulation (symmetrical, harmonious), alertness, tone, visual and auditory interactions.\n# '''Cardiovascular examination''' - resting heart rate (between 120 and 160 beats per minute); - skin recolouration time (< 3seconds); - search for a heart murmur ''(Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation)'' ;  - palpation of peripheral pulses, particularly femoral pulses (coarctation of the aorta); - auscultation of the anterior fontanel (arteriovenous malformation) '''([[Discovery of a vascular murmur SD-019|Discovery of a vascular murmur]]'''.\n# '''Pulmonary examination''' - nasal breathing, silent, regular, sometimes periodic, with no sign of respiratory distress (resting respiratory rate between 40 and 60 per minute); - symmetrical vesicular murmur, without noise added '''(Discovery of abnormality on pulmonary auscultation)'''.\n# Examination of the trunk, abdomen and hernial orifices - Abdomen supple and depressible. Look for organomegaly. The liver can be palpated (1 to 2 cm from the costal margin); - first urine passed before 24 hours of life; - first stools (meconium: thick, sticky, blackish stools) passed before 48 hours. If there is a delay in meconium output, check the permeability of the anus; - examination of the anal margin (anorectal malformation).\n# '''Examination of the external genital organs'''\n\n- search for abnormality of sexual differentiation (''Discovery of a malformation of the genital tract)'' ;\n\n- in boys: no unhooding, palpation of both testicles, frequent hydrocele (abnormality of the bursae);\n\n- in girls: presence of the vaginal orifice, possible leucorrhoea and metrorrhagia.\n\n# '''Skin examination (Infant skin spot)''''  - skin covered with vernix caseosa, a greasy, adherent white coating which disappears during the first few hours of life; - search for cutaneous-mucosal icterus '''([[Icterus in the newborn SD-048|Icterus]]] in the newborn)'''; - search for flat angiomas or haemangiomas; - transient non-pathological semiological features: oedema (palpebral, feet, hands, scrotum, pubis), lanugo, milium grains, so-called \"toxic\" erythema, livedo, ethnic spot.\n# palpation of the fontanelles (supple, neither depressed nor bulging); - search for a serosanguineous bump or cephalohaematoma; - examination of the neck: passive and active mobility (in the case of torticollis : whether reducible or not, look for a haematoma of the sternocleidomastoid muscles); - examination of the oral cavity: look for a velopalatine cleft and a short tongue frenulum.\n# Neurosensory examination (abnormalities in psychomotor development in infants and children)  - passive and active tone; - primary automatisms (or archaic reflexes); - overall behaviour: calm awakening, reactivity to stimulation, frank cry, ability to be consoled easily, rich, harmonious, symmetrical motor skills; - sensory functions: eye tracking, reaction to noises and voice.\n# '''Osteoarticular examination''' - palpation of the entire length of the spine (neural tube closure anomaly); - morphological integrity of the limbs, joint amplitudes; - examination of the hips; - traumatic lesions of the ''per-partum'' (facial paralysis, brachial plexus paralysis, clavicle fracture) '''([[Facial paralysis SD-127|Facial paralysis]])'''.",
