This network must bring together all the skills required to manage the pregnancy and welcome the child:\n\n- general practitioner ;\n\n- obstetrician, midwife ;\n\n- paediatrician ;\n\n- psychiatrist, psychologist ;\n\n- addictologist ;\n\n- tobacco midwife ;\n\n- midwife and PMI nursery nurse;\n\n- social worker.\n\nIt enables opiate substitution treatment to be introduced, withdrawal or a reduction in consumption depending on the substances concerned, and the pregnancy to be supported until term, minimising the medico-psycho-social complications for the child and the mother.\n\n'''Opiate substitution treatments'''\n\n- Opioid substitution treatments improve medical and obstetrical follow-up and reduce maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality.\n\n- However, pregnancy remains a high-risk pregnancy (prematurity, hypotrophy, withdrawal syndrome).\n\n- Two products can be used: methadone (M\u00e9thadone\u00ae in syrup or capsule form) and buprenorphine (generic Buprenorphine\u00ae or Subutex\u00ae in tablet form to be taken sublingually).\n\n- Pending marketing authorisation, Suboxone\u00ae, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone also used as a substitution treatment, should be replaced as far as possible by Subutex\u00ae during pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n\n- Treatment must be prescribed at an effective dose to maintain stable levels and avoid withdrawal in the mother-to-be and the foetus.\n\n- The increase in circulating volume at the end of pregnancy is accompanied by an increased need for opiates and usually requires an increase in dosage.\n\n- The severity of the withdrawal syndrome is not related to the dosage of substitution treatment.\n\nAll these points should be explained to the mother-to-be at the start of the pregnancy and reiterated during follow-up consultations.\n\nManagement of other addictions\n\nThere are a number of possible approaches when substitution treatment is not available:\n\n- monitoring consumption: setting up a logbook to track consumption and record cravings, consumption, trigger events, etc. ;\n\n- possible use of an anxiolytic (\"alcohol drug\", evening joint, etc.), giving preference to oxazepam (S\u00e9resta\u00ae), a benzodiazepine with an intermediate half-life;\n\n- motivational interview.\n\n'''293.
