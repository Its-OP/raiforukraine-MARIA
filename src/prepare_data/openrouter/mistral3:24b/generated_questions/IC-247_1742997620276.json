Many equations can be used. The most commonly used equations are those drawn from the Framingham study (United States) and the European SCORE project (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation).\n\n\nEstimation of absolute risk\n\nUse of equations or tables or simple summation of cardiovascular risk factors:\n\n- an event risk of around 10% at 10 years is considered low;\n\n- A risk of between 10% and 20% is considered intermediate;\n\n- A risk of more than 20% is considered significant (this is the level of coronary risk observed in the aftermath of a myocardial infarction);\n\n- a risk of more than 30% is a major risk.",
