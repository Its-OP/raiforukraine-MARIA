If the direct immunofluorescence test is negative, it can rule out the diagnosis of autoimmune bullous dermatosis and point to other causes of bullous lesions. It can also be used to distinguish between the group of sub-epidermal dermatoses (pemphigoid for autoimmune causes) and intra-epidermal dermatoses (pemphigus group for autoimmune causes).",
