It may extend to the bladder or the broad ligament and be associated with a wound of the uterine pedicle.\n<br />\n\n===Diagnosis===\n- Risk factors :\n\n\u00a7 scarred uterus (caesarean section or gynaecological cause = myomectomy), history of uterine perforation\n\n\u00a7 high multiparity\n\n\u00a7 a very long job\n\n\u00a7 Maturation by prostaglandins in a scar uterus\n\n\u00a7 less than 6 months between uterine surgery and the onset of pregnancy\n\n- During obstetrical labour in 75 to 80% of cases\n\n- Abrupt abdominal pain associated with RCF abnormalities in 50 to 90% of cases\n\n- Under epidural, the pain may be masked, pain in the shoulders, sign of haemoperitoneum\n\n- Vaginal bleeding in 30 to 40% of cases\n\n- Arterial hypotension, collapse\n<br />\n\n==''Chorio-amniotitis (intrauterine infection)'''==\n\n===Definition===\n- Chorioamniotitis (or intrauterine infection) is an infection of the foetal membranes (made up of the amnion and chorion) at the foetomaternal interface. It may or may not be associated with rupture of the membranes. Chorioamniotitis is a major risk factor for early neonatal bacterial infection (more rarely viral or fungal) and maternal post-partum infection (endometritis).\n\n===Diagnosis===\n- Maternal fever (sometimes absent) [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044]]\n\n- Abdominal pain and uterine contractions, pain on uterine palpation [[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098]]\n\n- Discharge of fluid in the event of rupture of the foetal membranes (sometimes stained), which may be purulent. [Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109\n\n- Foetal tachycardia or abnormal FHR\n\nNote: chorioamniotitis occurs most frequently in the context of premature rupture of the membranes.",
