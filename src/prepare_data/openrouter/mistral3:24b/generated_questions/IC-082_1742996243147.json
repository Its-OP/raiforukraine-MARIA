It corresponds to a ''transient ischaemic attack of the retina''.\n\nIt is a diagnostic ''emergency'' because of the risk of a ''constituted retinal artery occlusion or ischaemic stroke''.\n\nCarotid atheroma or embolism cardiopathy should be sought first. Horton's disease should also be systematically considered.",
