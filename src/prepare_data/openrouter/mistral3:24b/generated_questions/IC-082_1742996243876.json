    "question": "How can a healthcare professional determine whether a visual disorder is monocular or binocular?",
    "option_a": "By assessing the patient's subjective sensation of the disorder and its laterality if monocular, and then using optical correction to confirm the diagnosis.",
    "option_b": "By occluding one eye and then the other to see if the visual problem disappears, indicating a binocular disorder.",
    "option_c": "By measuring visual acuity with both eyes open and then with one eye closed to determine the nature of the visual disturbance.",
    "option_d": "By performing a series of eye movement tests to see if the visual problem is present in both eyes or just one.",
