Risk factors for VTE specific to the patient and the clinical situation must be taken into account.\n\nThromboprophylaxis is usually prescribed when there is a high risk of VTE:\n\n*in medicine, in patients with multiple risk factors for VTE;\n*in surgery, in the case of orthopaedic (hip, knee), carcinological or bariatric surgery, or in the presence of multiple risk factors for VTE.\nThere are 3 ways of preventing VTE:\n\n*Physical: early ambulation, combating dehydration;\n*mechanical: intermittent pneumatic compression if thromboprophylaxis is contraindicated;\n*medicinal: anticoagulants in prophylactic or preventive doses. The duration of prophylaxis is codified according to the clinical situation and, in practice, must cover the duration of the risk situation.",
