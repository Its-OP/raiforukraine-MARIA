Tumours of the urinary tract:''''\n**''''[[Bladder tumours|Urothelial tumours 314]] (bladder and upper excretory tract): this is the main aetiology to be ruled out because of its severity.'''' Risk factors: age \u2265 50 years, male sex, smoking, occupational exposure.\n**''''[[Kidney tumours|Kidney tumours 311]]:'''' these are generally locally advanced and bulky malignant tumours, or benign angiomyolipomas.\n**Prostate tumours|Prostatic tumours 310]] locally advanced in adults or vesico-prostatic rhabdomyosarcoma in children.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''B.

It is accompanied by a clinical picture suggestive of cystitis, pyelonephritis or male urinary tract infection. It may reveal classic uropathogenic bacteria (BGN: ''Escherichia coli'' or Cocci +: enterococci, etc.) or pathologies related to an epidemiological context:\n**Urinary tuberculosis: aseptic leucocyturia, calcification of the bladder wall (porcelain bladder) or ureteral wall, possible genital involvement.
