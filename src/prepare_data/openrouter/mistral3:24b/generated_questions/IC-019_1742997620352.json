As it has grown, it has been extended to cover groups of people, such as students, the unemployed and government contract workers, who are not employed in the private sector. France has chosen to achieve universal conversion of the population, whether or not they contribute to the financing of social security.\n\nThe general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), i.e. those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nSince 2018 and the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed (tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers and the non-regulated liberal professions).\n\n\n'''Organization'''\n\nSince the \"Jeanneney\" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organisation of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.\n\nThree of these branches cover one or more risks:\n\nhe Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It is responsible for supporting families in their day-to-day lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability;\n\nThe Sickness, Occupational Injuries and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers two types of risk: sickness, maternity, disability and death, and accidents at work and occupational diseases;\n\n'''the Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.'''\n\nIn addition, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a ''fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability''. This new branch will be managed by the Caisse nationale de solidarit\u00e9 pour l'autonomie (CNSA).\n\nTwo other branches carry out common, cross-functional tasks:\n\nthe social security contribution collection branch is managed by the Urssaf Caisse nationale (the new name, since 2021, of the Agence centrale des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale - Acoss). It collects the resources allocated to the other branches of social security (i.e. it collects the social security contributions - employer's and employee's - paid by employers), through the intermediary of local offices - the Urssaf;\n\nthe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des employeurs du R\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale is managed by the Union des caisses nationales de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (UCANSS). It is responsible for social dialogue, shared human resources management tasks and missions of common interest, such as property operations or sustainable development policies.\n\n\n\n'''Summary diagram'''\n\nThe general scheme will have four autonomous branches in 2021 (chart 1). The autonomy branch will be the fifth branch and is currently being set up.\n\nFigure 1: Organisation of the general social security system.\n\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\nSource: health insurance. <nowiki>https://assurance-maladie.ameli.fr/qui-sommes-nous/organisation/securite-sociale/securite-sociale</nowiki>\n\nEach branch is headed by a national fund (a public administrative body), which coordinates and manages a network of regional funds. The regional funds are private-law bodies responsible for providing a public service, subject to State control and supervision.",
