What are products and elements of the human body?\nThe \"elements\" of the human body are the organs, tissues and cells of the body. The \"products\" of the human body are renewable: blood and gametes, for example. Fingernails, hair, teeth and hair are called \"phanera\" and are excluded from the scope of the elements and products of the human body discussed here, which refer to three kinds of \"things\":\n\n# Blood and its components, as well as labile blood products.\n# Organs, which can only be \"used\" as part of a donation.\n# Finally, the broader category of tissues or cells, including haematopoietic cells derived from bone marrow, cord blood or placental blood, embryonic or foetal tissues or cells, cord and placental cells, gametes, etc.\n\n== II. What are the principles governing these products and elements of the human body? ==\nAll these products and elements are not vulgar things that can be exploited. But neither are they \"sacralised\". While the human body is in principle fundamentally unavailable (it cannot be alienated), its products and elements sometimes have to be taken to be used, for therapeutic purposes in particular. In a way, therefore, they are available. This availability is governed by three main principles:\n\n* Non-economic ownership: \"The human body, its elements and products cannot be the subject of an economic right\" (Civil Code, art. 16-1). This means that they can never be traded or associated with any price.\n\n* The person's informed consent. The removal of elements from the human body and the collection of its products is subject to the principle of the donor's prior consent, in accordance with the procedures laid down by law (article 1211-2 of the Public Health Code), with nuances and exceptions depending on the situation and the intended purpose. Once the collection or removal has been carried out, the products and elements may be used for purposes other than those initially intended, provided that the person concerned, duly informed, does not object.\n\n* Anonymity: According to article 16-8 of the French Civil Code, \"no information may be divulged that would make it possible to identify both the person who has donated an element or product of his or her body and the person who has received it. The donor may not know the identity of the recipient, nor may the recipient know the identity of the donor. In the event of therapeutic necessity, only the donor's and the recipient's doctors may have access to information enabling them to be identified.\n\nThese principles obviously do not apply in the same way in all cases. For example, \"a transfusion of renewable blood cells with a limited lifespan does not raise the same ethical and reflexive issues and elements as the transplantation of an organ essential to the survival of a recipient, or the aiding of the conception of an individual through the donation of gametes\" (Thibert, 2020).\n\n== III. Ethical issues beyond the legal framework ==\n\n* Elements and products of the human body may be incorporated into biological collections, sometimes known as \"biobanks\", which ensure their conservation and exploitation for scientific purposes or therapeutic innovation. This raises numerous questions about the ownership of samples, the right of withdrawal that donors may or may not exercise, the protection of health data, and the prospect of widespread commercialisation of these elements, for example (Clarizio ''et al''. 2022).\n* For gamete donation for medically assisted procreation (MAP), donor and recipient couples cannot come into contact and know each other's identities. Thus anonymity is initially preserved: the donors and the recipient couple or the single woman recipient can never know each other's identities. However, the 2021 Bioethics Act provides for access to origins for people born from donated gametes or embryos, when they reach the age of majority and if they so request, \"via a national commission\". They will be able to receive information about the donors and/or their identity.\n* In the case of organ removal from the living, consent is obtained after information has been provided on the risks and possible consequences of removal. In the case of \"post-mortem\" removal, consent is reversed (also known as \"presumed consent\"), and presupposes the absence of refusal of such removal, by registration on an automated national register set up for this purpose (see \"Organ donation\" and \"Organ donation and removal from deceased persons\" sheets). This raises ethical issues. Considering \"presumed\" consent as \"genuine\" consent is by no means self-evident, since to consent is to \"agree with\", which implies that you have consciously acquiesced to what you have been offered or asked. To deduce consent to organ donation (the idea of donation also implies an active and personal gesture) from an absence of opposition to the removal poses a problem that the legal framework alone is not sufficient to resolve. Carers cannot therefore take a decision unilaterally on the basis of the law alone. It is essential to open a dialogue with the deceased person's next of kin, all the more so when the deceased person had not explicitly indicated his or her wish to have his or her organs removed \"post mortem\" (possession of a donor card, explicit statements on the subject, etc.).\n\n==== Bibliographical references ====\nClarizio, Emanuele ; Ch\u00e9rici, C\u00e9line ; Dupont, Jean-Claude ; Guchet, Xavier, Herpe, Yves-\u00c9douard.
