Snacks are essential during intense physical activity.\n\nThe main aim of dietetics in type 1 diabetes is to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood sugar levels, either through the consumption of products with a high glycaemic index or through an inadequate intake of carbohydrates at meals or during physical exercise, which could lead to hypoglycaemia. [[Hypoglycaemia SD-209]]; [[Hyperglycaemia SD-208]]\n\nPatients must learn to take sugar again in the event of hypoglycaemia.\n\nRegular physical activity promotes a better metabolic balance. It requires education to avoid hypo- and hyperglycaemia at the time of sport and/or afterwards. A clinical assessment is necessary when resuming an activity after a long period of inactivity.\n\nDiabetes can cause personal and family distress. Psychological support can improve metabolic control.\n\n<ref>Polycopy of the Coll\u00e8ge des Enseignants d'Endocrinologie, Diab\u00e8te et Maladies M\u00e9taboliques</ref>\n<references />",
