Hyperthermia/fever]]''', the foetus (ultrasound scan, altered well-being) and/or by serological screening [[Interpretation of a serology result SD-236|'''236. Interpretation of a serology result''''.]]\n\n\nDepending on the infectious agent and the time of onset, contamination can lead to the threat of premature delivery, intrauterine infection, late miscarriage, malformative syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation and/or foetal death \"in utero\".",
