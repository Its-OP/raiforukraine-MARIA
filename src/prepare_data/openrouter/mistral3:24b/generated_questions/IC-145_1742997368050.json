Its 4 health monitoring missions are :\n\n'''''. Ongoing monitoring and observation of the state of health of the French population '''''\n\n*Collecting and processing data on health status for epidemiological purposes, via correspondents making up the national public health network (RNSP),\n*Examples: monitoring the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in certain bacterial species (e.g. Escherichia coli and \u03b2-lactams, enterococci and glycopeptides), the incidence of notifiable diseases (e.g. invasive meningococcal infections, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis), vaccination in the population (vaccination coverage).\n\n'''''2. Health watch and vigilance'''''\n\n*To analyse and update knowledge of health risks, their causes and trends,\n*Detect risk factors likely to modify or alter the health of the population.\n\n'''''3. Health warning'''''\n\n*Inform the Minister for Health of any threat to public health,\n*Make recommendations to prevent or mitigate the threat.\n\n'''''4. Contributing to the management of health crisis situations'''''\n\n*''Ex: in the event of an alert linked to an emerging virus (e.g. SARS-CoV-2), SFP is responsible for validating the criteria defining a suspect case when a patient presents as a possible case''.\n\nIts fields of action cover communicable infectious diseases, but also the effects of the environment on health, work-related risks, chronic diseases and trauma, as well as international health risks, whether infectious or not.\n\nSFP has a regional network of Inter-Regional Epidemiology Units (CIRE, see above) which relay its actions and carry out some of its tasks at regional level.",
