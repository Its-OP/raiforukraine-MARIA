Oblique distal and anterior radiation towards the homolateral iliac fossa, or even the external genitalia. Absence of analgesic position, sometimes accompanied by agitation. Functional urinary signs may also accompany the pain (urinary frequency, burning, haematuria), as well as digestive signs (nausea, vomiting). The pain is due to tension in the excretory cavities following the obstruction of the urinary tract.\n\n==Clinical examination\n\n*Interview: History (lithiasis?), medication taken, time since onset of pain.\n*Physical examination: Pain on palpation and shaking of the lumbar fossa. No pain on palpation of the spine or paravertebral muscle masses. No tenderness. Urine dipstick: positive for blood in >70% of cases. Temperature taken\n\n==Additional examinations\n\n*Biological: CBC, platelets, ionogram, creatinine. Look for impairment of renal function. If associated infection is suspected: ECBU.\n*Imaging: ultrasound + PSA (sensitivity 80-90%) or ideally abdominal and pelvic CT scan without contrast injection (sensitivity 96%) within 24-48 hours in the absence of complications (fever, hyperalgesia, renal failure/oligo-anuria). Imaging looks for dilatation of the pyelo-caliceal cavities and an obstruction in the urinary tract (stone, tumour, etc.).\n*Emergency imaging: by uninjected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is any doubt about the diagnosis (no obstruction, no dilatation) in the event of fever, renal failure (uninjected), hyperalgesia (no injection).\n\n==[[2C-161|Acute pyelonephritis 161]] :==\n\n*Unilateral lumbar pain, insidious in onset, most often associated with hyperthermia and functional signs of the lower tract (pollakiuria, urethral burning, urgency). Pain on shaking the lumbar fossa during clinical examination. Urine dipstick positive for blood, leukocytes +/- nitrites most often. Biological tests: CBC, platelets, ionogram, creatininemia, ECBU.\n*Imaging:\n**Simple PNAS: if fever or pain persists after 48-72 hours: ultrasound or ideally non-injected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is diagnostic doubt (absence of obstruction, dilatation) or complication (abscess).\n**ANP at risk of complication or serious: as a matter of urgency: non-injected AP CT scan, then possibly injected if there is any doubt about the diagnosis (absence of obstruction, dilatation).\n\n==[[2C-050|Torsion of the spermatic cord 50]] :==\n\n*Pain of abrupt onset, atypical presentation with possible projected lumbar pain. No analgesic position. In young men. No associated fever or urinary signs. Physical examination usually reveals an ascending testicle, difficult to examine, retracted at the ring. No further examination is necessary and if there is any doubt about the diagnosis, urgent surgical investigation is required.",
