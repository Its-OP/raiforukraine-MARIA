B ultrasound is always indicated when the retina is not visible to rule out the presence of retinal detachment (+++).\n\nThe main ''causes'' of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:\n\n*proliferative diabetic retinopathy\n*ischaemic occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches\n*retinal tear: a retinal tear, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment, may result in intravitreal haemorrhage due to rupture of a retinal vessel.\n*Terson's syndrome: uni- or bilateral intravitreal haemorrhage associated with meningeal haemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome may also be associated with meningeal haemorrhage of traumatic origin).",
