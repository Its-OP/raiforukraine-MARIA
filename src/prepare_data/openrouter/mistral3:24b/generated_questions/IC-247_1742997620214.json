[Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, education of a type 1 diabetic patient SD-280]]\n\nIntensified insulin therapy reduces glycated haemoglobin and delays and reduces the severity of micro- and macroangiopathic complications. It does, however, increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nThe objectives of treatment are a compromise between ensuring the freest possible life and preventing acute or chronic complications of the disease.\n\nTherapeutic education'' is necessary to empower patients in the self-management of their disease, and must take into account the experiences of patients and their families.\n\nRecommended glycaemic targets for non-elderly type 1 diabetics :\n\n0.9-1.20 g/L in the morning on an empty stomach\n\nBefore meals 0.8-1.2 g/L\n\n2 hours after meals 1.2-1.8 g/L\n\n1.2 g/L at bedtime\n\n''At 3 a.m. > 0.8 g/L\n\n''HbA1c < 7%''\n\nThese general objectives must be personalised to the situation of each patient, respecting a compromise between glycaemic control, the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and quality of life.
