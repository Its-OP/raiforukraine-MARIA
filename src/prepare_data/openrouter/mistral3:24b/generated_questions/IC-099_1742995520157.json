In the absence of biological or radiological markers, the diagnosis is clinical, based on questioning using the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD (International Classification of Headache Disorders) and a normal clinical examination. ([[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]] ; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]] ; [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]])\n\n\n'''Rule out a secondary headache'''\n\nQuestioning identifies any acute, recent and unusual [[Headache SD-118|Headache]], which must be considered secondary and explored rapidly. It looks for the red flags that immediately raise suspicion of a serious cause (''item 100)''. A diagnosis of primary headache should not be made during a first episode. The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches (apart from the dysautonomic signs of an AVF attack).\n\n'''Specify the type of primary headache'''\n\nOnce it has been established that the patient is consulting us for habitual, long-standing headaches (''for at least 3 months'', often much longer), the questioning takes place in 5 stages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''1'''\n|Letting the patient express himself\n|- Predominant symptoms\n\n- Main concerns\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Characterise the headache\n|- Duration and frequency of attacks, evolution over time\n\n- Topography, intensity, type of pain, aggravating or calming factors (dietary, hormonal, emotional)\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|'''Identify accompanying signs''''\n|- \"Migraine\" symptoms: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], photo-/phonophobia, pulsatility\n\n- Trigemino-autonomic\" symptoms: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|edema of the eyelid]].\n\n- Behaviour during seizures, agitation\n\n- Focal symptoms, postural element\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|'''Resituer le contexte du patient'''\n|- Antecedents, context, triggers, infections, trauma, travel, psychiatric situation, repercussions on sleep, work, social life, schooling, etc.\n\n- Patient expectations and beliefs about the disease\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|'''Review the history of treatments tried and current treatments''''\n|- Crisis and background treatments, length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, etc.\n\n- Frequency of drug use in the last 3 months (look for abuse), effectiveness of treatments\n|}\nThe clinical examination is normal in primary headaches.\n\n- The characteristics of the headache help to make the diagnosis (''item 100''). The temporal profile is very important: duration of attacks without treatment; number of headache days per month; duration of headaches without treatment.\n\no ''Headache < 15 days/month'': the main causes are episodic migraine and episodic tension headache.\n\no '''Headache \u2265 15 days/month:''' chronic daily headache (CCQ). A distinction is made between :\n\n*''Short-term QCC'' (attacks <4 hours): facial vascular algesia and trigeminal neuralgia;\n*''Long-term QCC'' (>4 hours): chronic migraine or, more rarely, chronic tension headache, both with or without drug abuse. The pain may be permanent, from waking up to going to bed, and may continue into the night.",
