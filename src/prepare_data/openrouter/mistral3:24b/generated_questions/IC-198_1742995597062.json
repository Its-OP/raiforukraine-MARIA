Dosage must be adapted to age.\n\nIntra-articular infiltration of a cortisone derivative, provided that an associated infection has been ruled out by examination of the synovial fluid, is a simple solution in cases of monoarthritis.",

    "question": "How should an acute attack of calcium pyrophosphate crystals be treated, especially in older patients?",
    "option_a": "With the same treatment as for gouty attacks, but with higher dosages to account for age.",
    "option_b": "By avoiding NSAIDs and colchicine due to the risk of interactions with other medications.",
    "option_c": "By using intra-articular infiltration of a cortisone derivative, after ruling out infection.",
