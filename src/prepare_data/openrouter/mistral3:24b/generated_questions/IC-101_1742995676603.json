Severe and painful PFP with hearing impairment.\n\n- ENT pathology (mastoiditis, parotitis, parotid tumour): evocative auricular discharge or painful enlargement of the parotid gland ([[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]]).\n\n- Lyme meningo-radiculitis: tick bite in the preceding days or weeks or erythematous plaque. PFP may reveal the infection.\n\n- other bacterial or viral meningoradiculitis (coxsackie, herpes, mumps).\n\n- HIV infection, particularly during seroconversion.\n\n* Brain stem stroke: PFP associated with contralateral hemiplegia of the face (alternating syndrome).\n\n* Multiple sclerosis: importance of a history of previous relapses.\n\n* Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: PFP in the background of a picture dominated by limb involvement. Facial diplegia may occur.\n\n* General inflammatory diseases:\n\n- Sarcoidosis: PFP may inaugurate the disease (most frequent cranial involvement).\n\n- Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome: recurrent PFP, with mucocutaneous infiltration of the face, plicated tongue and family history.\n\n* Tumours: progressive onset, usually affecting other cranial nerves (cerebellopontine angle tumour, trunk glioma, skull base metastasis, carcinomatous meningoradiculitis). In the case of parotid swelling, the onset of facial paralysis raises fears of a malignant tumour.",
