In this case, nocturnal urine volume is greater than daytime volume, with lower urine osmolarity at night.\n*Isolated primary enuresis may have low bladder capacity, defined as a functional bladder capacity, assessed on a 48-hour voiding schedule, of less than 70% of theoretical bladder capacity.\n\n<br />\n\n*The positive diagnosis of primary enuresis is above all clinical. It is based on questioning and physical examination.\n*No imaging test is necessary as a first-line diagnosis.\n*The degree of severity of enuresis must be assessed (one night per month, more than one night per week, every night).\n*A family history exists in 30 to 60% of cases.\n*20% of children suffering from ADHD have associated primary enuresis and 10% of enuretics suffer from ADHD. This comorbidity should be investigated.\n\n<br />",
