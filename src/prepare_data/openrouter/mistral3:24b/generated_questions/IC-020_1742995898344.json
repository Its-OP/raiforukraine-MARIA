While experimental studies can provide proof of causality, observational studies can only discuss the plausibility of this causality, in the light of the \"Bradford Hill causality criteria\":\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''BRADFORD HILL CAUSALITY CRITERIA''''\n|-\n|Criteria '''internal''' to the study\n|Statistical association between exposure and the phenomenon studied\n\nStrength of the association\n\nDose-effect relationship\n\nSpecificity of the relationship\n\nMinimisation of selection and ranking bias. All known confounding factors are correctly taken into account.\n\nAbsence of temporal ambiguity (exposure must precede the phenomenon studied)\n|-\n|Criteria \"external\" to the study\n|External consistency: consistency between study results\n\nBiological plausibility (known pathophysiological mechanism)\n\nConsistency with in vitro and animal studies\n\nParallel geographical gradients in exposure and the phenomenon studied\n\nDecrease in the incidence of the phenomenon studied when exposure is eliminated or reduced\n|}\n<small>*The criterion of specificity of the relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied is very convincing when it is present but is absent most of the time even if the causal relationship is very plausible. It is now accepted that an effect can be multi-causal (environment, genetic, etc.) and therefore the specificity of the relationship is no longer an essential causality criterion</small>\n\n\nThe different types of study therefore do not have the same demonstrative value in terms of causality, which translates into ''a different level of evidence'' (classification proposed by the Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9, cf [[Argumenter les niveaux de preuve des principales sources d'information 2C-323-PE-A03]]):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Grade des recommandations''''\n|'''Level of scientific evidence provided by the literature'''\n|-\n|'''A Scientific evidence established'''\n|'''Level 1'''\n\n* high-powered randomised controlled trials\n* meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials\n* decision analysis based on well-conducted studies\n|-\n|'''B Scientific presumption'''\n|'''Level 2'''\n\n* low-power randomised controlled trials\n* well-conducted non-randomised comparative studies\n* cohort studies\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''C Low level of scientific evidence'''\n|'''Level 3'''\n\n* case-control studies.\n|-\n|'''Level 4'''\n\n* comparative studies with significant bias\n* retrospective studies\n* case series\n* descriptive epidemiological studies (cross-sectional, longitudinal)\n|}\n<br />",
