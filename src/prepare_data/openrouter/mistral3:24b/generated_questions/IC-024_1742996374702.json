    "option_a": "It indicates the need for immediate delivery to prevent maternal complications.",
    "option_b": "It suggests the presence of significant proteinuria and requires further quantification by 24-hour proteinuria analysis.",
    "option_c": "It means the patient should be monitored for gestational diabetes.",
    "option_d": "It indicates the need for immediate administration of antihypertensive medication.",
