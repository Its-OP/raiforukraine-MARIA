When the tumour grows locally, it may cross the capsule and reach the seminal vesicles and adjacent organs (rectum, bladder neck, external sphincter, pelvic wall).\n\n*Lymphatic extension is to the pelvic regional lymph nodes (iliac) and then to distant non-regional lymph nodes (lumbo-aortic).\n*The main site of non-node metastasis is bone, but the tumour can also spread to the lung and liver.\n\n\n\nExtension assessment of localised/locally advanced prostate cancer depends on the [[OIC-310-07-B|d'Amico prognostic group]] (CC-AFU 2022-2024) (OIC-310-07-B):\n\n-Low risk: pelvic MRI\n\n-Intermediate risk: pelvic MRI + bone scan with SPECT/CT (if ISUP: 3, 4 or 5)\n\n-High risk: pelvic MRI + bone scan with SPECT/CT + thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan\n\nFor all 3 groups, prostate MRI is requested for local extension (capsule, seminal vesicles) if it has not been performed prior to biopsies.\n\nExtension work-up for metastatic prostate cancer includes: bone scan and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan. In metastatic prostate cancer, pelvic MRI is optional.\n\n\n'''TNM classification (2018)''' - for information\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"5\" |T\n\nPrimary tumour\n|T0: primary tumour not found\n|-\n|T1: tumour not palpable on digital rectal examination (DRE) or visible on imaging\n\n*T1a: tumour occupying less than 5% of resected tissue with an ISUP score of 1 or absence of grade 4 or 5.\n*T1b: tumour occupying more than 5% of resected tissue or ISUP score \u2265 2 or presence of grade 4 or 5.\n*T1c: tumour discovered on prostate biopsy due to an elevated PSA value.\n|-\n|T2: tumour confined to the prostate\n\n*T2a: tumour affecting half a lobe or less\n*T2b: tumour affecting more than half a lobe but not both lobes.\n\n*T2c: tumour affecting both lobes\n|-\n|T3: extension beyond the prostate gland\n\n*T3a: uni- or bilateral extra-prostatic extension\n*T3b: extension to the seminal vesicles uni- or bilaterally\n|-\n|T4: tumour fixed or involving structures other than the seminal vesicles (external sphincter, rectum, anus lift muscle or pelvic wall).\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |N\n\nRegional lymph nodes\n|Nx : regional lymph nodes not evaluated\n|-\n|N0: no regional lymph node metastasis\n|-\n|N1: regional lymph node involvement\n|-\n|N1 mi: lymph node metastasis \u2264 0.2 cm (optional)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |M\n\nDistant metastases <br />\n|Mx: distant metastases not assessed\n|-\n|M0: no distant metastases\n|-\n|M1: distant metastases\n\n*M1a: non-regional lymph node involvement\n*M1b: bone involvement\n\nM1c: other sites with or without bone involvement\n|}\n[[File:NOU05.png|neant|thumb|'''Diagram: Sagittal section of the prostate and neighbouring organs''']]\n\n\n[[File:NOU02.png|neant|vignette|''Diagram: Local and regional extension of the prostate'']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n<br />",
