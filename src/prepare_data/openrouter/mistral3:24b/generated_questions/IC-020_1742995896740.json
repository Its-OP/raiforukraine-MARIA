In this case, ''the study may be described as interventional (without being experimental, as there is no change in the nature or levels of the exposure factor)''.\n\n<nowiki>*************************************************************************************************************************************************************</nowiki>\n\n\nRole of the ''promoter'': the natural or legal person who takes the initiative to conduct the research, manages it and ensures that it is funded. They are legally responsible for the research. All RIPH must be promoted.\n\nRole of the investigator: the individual who directs and supervises the conduct of research at a site, in accordance with the protocol.\n\n'''Information and consent''' of research participants: Individuals must be informed prior to any inclusion in research. This information must be appropriate, complete, fair and comprehensible. In the case of studies involving human subjects, informed consent must be obtained for category 1 or 2 RIPH, or non-opposition for category 3 RIPH, prior to any inclusion.\n\nRole of the ''Comit\u00e9 de Protection des Personnes'' ('''CPP''', there are around forty in France): made up of health professionals (doctors, pharmacists, methodologists/biostatisticians) and people from civil society, it checks that the research complies with the conditions set by law and issues a decision-making opinion on the <u>scientific validity and ethical aspects</u> of the research. All RIPH must be authorised by a CPP before it can begin.\n\nAuthorisations from other structures or bodies (CNIL, ANSM, etc) are also required before an RIPH can be launched. The nature and complexity of obtaining these authorisations depends directly on the category of RIPH.\n\n\n'''Non-IPHR research''': research that does not belong to any type of IPHR does not fall within the scope of the Jard\u00e9 law. It is not therefore subject to authorisation by a CPP, but when it involves the use of individual personal data, it must be submitted to the CNIL. This is particularly the case for research based on retrospective data already collected during treatment or previous research, research into cosmetics, satisfaction surveys linked to treatment or not, experiments in the human and social sciences in the health field, evaluations of the way in which health professionals practise, teaching practices in the health field, etc.\n\n<br />",
