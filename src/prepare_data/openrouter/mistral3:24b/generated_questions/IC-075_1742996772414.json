  "question": {
    "question": "Which of the following best describes the primary mechanism by which tobacco smoke contributes to arterial damage?",
    "option_a": "By causing venous thrombosis through the release of inflammatory mediators",
    "option_b": "By promoting platelet aggregation, which increases the risk of arterial thrombosis",
    "option_c": "By directly damaging the alveoli, leading to reduced oxygen intake and arterial damage",
    "option_d": "By inducing vasodilation, which reduces blood pressure and causes arterial damage",
    "correct_option": "B"
