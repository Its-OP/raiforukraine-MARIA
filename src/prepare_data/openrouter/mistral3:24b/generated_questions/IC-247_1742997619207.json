[Hypoglycaemia SD-209; Hyperglycaemia SD-208.\n\nPatients should be aware that HbA1c is used to estimate blood glucose control over the 2 to 3 months prior to blood sampling, and should know their HbA1c target.\n\nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose levels should be carried out by the patient: \"4-6 times a day\". For a long time, self-monitoring of blood glucose was based on capillary blood tests obtained by finger pricking. The availability, with reimbursement, of glucose sensors that measure glucose levels continuously has revolutionised the monitoring of insulin-treated diabetes.\n\nIn the presence of unexplained and prolonged hyperglycaemia, \u00b1 associated with digestive symptoms, patients are taught to look for the presence of ketone bodies in the urine or in the blood using capillary sampling, in order to detect ketotic decompensation at an early stage.
