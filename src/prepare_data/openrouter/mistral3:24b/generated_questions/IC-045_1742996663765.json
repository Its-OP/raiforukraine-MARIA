If this is not the case, the diagnosis is made in the neonatal period on the basis of the triad:\n\n- Axial hypotonia\n\n- Heart murmur on auscultation ([[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation]])\n\n- Facial dysmorphia\n\nVery rarely, the diagnosis may be made later (mosaic trisomy 21) based on the following factors\n\n- Psychomotor retardation ([[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|psychomotor development abnormality]])\n\n- Learning difficulties associated with immaturity",
