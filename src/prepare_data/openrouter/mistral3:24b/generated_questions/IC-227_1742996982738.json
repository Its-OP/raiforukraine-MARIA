This pressure will naturally decrease from the ankle to the thigh due to the morphology of the limb. Its action involves a haemodynamic (venous trunks) and microcirculatory effect. It is most effective when applied in the morning, within an hour of getting up. Its application sometimes requires the use of devices to aid donning or the assistance of a third party.\n\nThere are 4 classes of elastic compression socks, stockings and tights, depending on the pressure exerted on the ankle (between 10 and 15 mmHg: class I; between 15.1 and 20 mmHg: class II; between 20.1 and 36 mmHg: class III; > 36 mmHg: class IV). The indications are summarised in the table below, which is based on the 2010 HAS recommendations. Functional CVI is an indication for class I compression. Lymphatic insufficiency is an indication for class IV compression.\n\nThe contraindications to elastic compression are: obliterative arterial disease with SPI < 0.60; septic venous thrombosis; phlegmatia caerulae; diabetic microangiopathy with TcPO2 < 30 mmHg.\n\nRegular reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio of compression is essential in cases of : OAMI with SPI between 0.60 and 0.90; advanced peripheral neuropathy; oozing or eczematous dermatosis; intolerance to the fibres used.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Clinical situation\n!Devices\n!Methods\n|-\n|Varicose veins > 3 mm\n| Socks, thigh-highs, pantyhose\n\n- Class II or III\n|Long-term\n|-\n|After sclerotherapy, heat treatment or stripping (varies according to team)\n| Lower thigh\n- Class II or III\n|4 to 6 weeks (varies according to team)\n|-\n|Chronic oedema of venous origin\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Long-term\n\nRegular re-evaluation\n\nthe benefit/risk ratio\n|-\n|Pigmentation, eczema\n\nvenous\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Lipodermatosclerosis,\n\nvenous hypodermatitis,\n\nwhite atrophy\n| - Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Healed ulcer\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV\n|-\n|Open ulcer\n|<Multi-type bandages as first-line treatment</nowiki>.\n\n- Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV (maximum tolerated)\n|Until healing\n\ncomplete\n|}\n\n==''Drug treatment'''==\nVenotonic drugs are only prescribed in cases of functional symptoms (discomfort, heaviness in the legs) and as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle and elastic compression. They are prescribed sequentially for short periods.\n\n==Sclerotherapy, endovenous thermal techniques and surgery ==\nThese treatments are indicated for symptomatic varicose veins and aim to \"destroy\" the pathological veins. The indication must also take into account the patient's condition. In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or atheromatous disease (coronary artery disease, obliterative arterial disease, etc.), the venous capital should be preserved as far as possible so that it can be used for arterial bypass surgery at a later date, in the absence of major varicose veins. Varicose veins secondary to a post-thrombotic syndrome should generally be respected, as they can compensate for deep vein obstruction; treatment should be on a case-by-case basis if superficial venous insufficiency aggravates deep venous insufficiency.\n\nThe choice of technique depends on the location, appearance and diameter of the varicose veins.\n\n===''Sclerotherapy'''===\nSclerotherapy involves the percutaneous injection of a sclerosing agent (liquid or foam) into a varicose vein. The injection can be carried out under ultrasound control (= echosclerotherapy). It may be carried out alone or in conjunction with another technique.\n\nThe endothelial inflammation generated will lead to fibrous and retractile scarring of the treated vein.\n\nIt is widely indicated from CEAP stage C2 upwards.\n\nThe possible complications should not, however, lead to this treatment being trivialised (haematoma, sequelae of pigmentation and intra-arterial injection, which is particularly serious but exceptional). The benefit/risk balance must therefore be carefully assessed in mild forms of CVI, and patients must be given full information.\n\n===''Endovenous thermal techniques'''===\nEndovenous thermal techniques (laser or radiofrequency) have replaced traditional surgical techniques. When feasible, they are the first-line treatment when sclerotherapy is not indicated. They can be carried out without a general anaesthetic and allow patients to resume physical and professional activity as quickly as possible. It consists of destroying the venous wall using heat after an anaesthetic has been applied around the vein to be treated.\n\n===''Surgery'''===\nThe indications for surgery are becoming increasingly limited. The most common techniques are stripping and phlebectomy.\n\nStripping is indicated in extensive and tortuous forms and requires a general or loco-regional anaesthetic and time off work.\n\nPhlebectomies consist of removing segments of superficial varicose veins by micro-incisions in the skin under local anaesthetic. Phlebectomies can be performed in stages, respecting the saphenous trunk.\n\n==='''Crenotherapy or spa treatment'''===\nCrenotherapy may be proposed as an adjuvant treatment in certain targeted cases which remain symptomatic after medical or interventional treatment (CVI with significant skin repercussions, disabling post-thrombotic syndrome, disabling lymphoedema).",
