They must be able to self-treat according to a predefined treatment explained and prescribed by their doctor;\n\n- Patients should be aware that treating an attack alone is not enough to treat gout, and should be aware of the importance of hypouricemic treatment, which alone can permanently relieve the symptoms of gout;\n\n- the choice of treatment for a gout attack depends on :\n\n- co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency defined by an estimated GFR <60 ml/min, diabetes, peptic ulcer, infections);\n\n- a history of drug intolerance;\n\n- potential drug interactions;\n\n- the number and type of joints affected;\n\n- the drugs that can be used to treat the crisis are :\n\n- colchicine: 1 mg at the onset of the attack, followed by \u00bd mg an hour later, i.e. 1.5 mg on day 1 and continued on subsequent days at 0.5 mg \u00d7 2-3 per day depending on progress.  \n\n- NSAIDs per os: at the onset of the attack and for a short period during the attack. They should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency or severe cardiovascular disease,\n\n- oral corticosteroid therapy: from the onset of the attack, at a dose of 30 to 35 mg per day (prednisone equivalent) for 3 to 5 days\n\n- local corticosteroid therapy (intra-articular);\n\n- IL-1 inhibitors: in hospital, if other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.\n\nOther pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures may be combined:\n\n- rest (simple brace, orthosis) and joint icing (with skin protection, which shortens the duration of access),\n\n- analgesic medication according to pain assessment.\n\n<br />",
