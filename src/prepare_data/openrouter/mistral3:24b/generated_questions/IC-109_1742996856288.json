If MRI is not indicated, a CT scan and angioscan of the polygon of Willis should be performed.\n\nIn the event of non-acute symptoms, a cerebral MRI may be suggested initially in order to rule out chronic adult hydrocephalus, an evolving intracranial lesion process or an acute/chronic subdural haematoma.\n\nIn the context of Parkinsonian syndromes, brain imaging is unnecessary when the clinical picture is typically suggestive of Parkinson's disease. It should only be carried out when there are atypical features of the Parkinsonian syndrome (cases of Parkinsonian syndromes plus).\n\n\n\nMRI: (stroke, chronic hydrocephalus in adults, parkinsonian syndromes)",
