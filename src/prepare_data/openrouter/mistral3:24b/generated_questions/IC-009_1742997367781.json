The Code of Medical Ethics serves as a reference for the jurisdictional bodies of the Ordre des M\u00e9decins.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=3}}\n\nThe word \"deontology\" first appeared in French in 1825, in a translation of the work of the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham entitled \"Essai sur la nomenclature et la classification des principales branches d'Art et Science\".\n\nIn medicine, for example, professional ethics serve as a reference for the legal bodies of the Ordre des M\u00e9decins, but first and foremost as a guide for doctors in their day-to-day practice, in the service of patients.\n\nThe code of medical ethics is not drawn up by the profession alone. While the profession, represented in this case by the Ordre National des M\u00e9decins, is responsible for drafting it, the resulting text is submitted to the administration, the Conseil d'Etat and finally the government, each of which is responsible for checking that it complies with the laws and other regulations governing the society in which doctors practise, and may make amendments. Finally, the code is published in the Journal Officiel under the signature of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Code of Ethics sets out the regulatory provisions governing professional practice. They are subordinate to other more important texts, in particular the Constitution and laws; they must be compatible with other decrees and require other texts of lesser scope, in particular decrees. Like other citizens, doctors are subject to the law - regarding respect for life or professional secrecy, for example - but the smooth running of their professional body is promoted by rules of their own.\n\n* See the text of the code of ethics for doctors <nowiki>https://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/code-deontologie</nowiki>",
