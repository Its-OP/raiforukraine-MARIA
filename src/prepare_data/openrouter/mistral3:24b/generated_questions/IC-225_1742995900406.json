The associated drug treatment consists of preventing the complications of atherosclerosis: prescription of a statin (''[[Prescription and monitoring of a lipid-lowering agent]]''), antiplatelet treatment (''[[Anti-platelet agents|Prescription and monitoring of an antiaggregant treatment]]'') and an ACE inhibitor/ARB2 for the control of [[Hypertension in adults and children|hypertension]].\n\n===''Monitoring of AAA'''===\nThe monitoring schedule for asymptomatic AAA depends on its maximum diameter and the value at which the indication for surgery is discussed:\n\n- Maximum diameter less than 40 mm: surveillance ultrasound every year\n\n- Maximum diameter between 40 and 49 mm: surveillance ultrasound every 6 months\n\nFrom 50 mm, the indication for surgery is discussed.\n\n===''Surgical management'''===\nThe aim of surgical treatment of AAA is to prevent it from rupturing.\n\n- In men, it is discussed from a maximum diameter of 50 mm.\n\n- In women, it may be discussed for a diameter of less than 50 mm, as the risk of rupture is higher in women of the same diameter.\n\n- In men and women, it is indicated in cases of rapid growth (more than 1 cm in one year), or in cases of complicated aneurysms.\n\nThe pre-operative assessment includes an overall cardiovascular evaluation and an assessment of renal and respiratory function.\n\nTwo surgical techniques are currently used: conventional surgery and endovascular surgery.\n[[File:AAA Surgery.jpg|vignette]]\n- Conventional surgical treatment consists of flattening the graft. After laparotomy or lumbotomy, aortic clamping, opening of the AAA shell and removal of the thrombus, a prosthetic tube is sutured to the healthy aorta above and below the aneurysm to reconstruct the aorta.\n[[File:Aorta Endoprosthesis.jpg|vignette]]\n- Endovascular surgical treatment is less invasive. It involves intra-arterial femoral insertion of a suitable stent graft which is deployed in the aneurysm. A seal is achieved proximally, on a segment of healthy aorta above the AAA and below the renal arteries (collar), and distally, in the iliac arteries. Exclusion of the aneurysm by stent grafting requires specific anatomical conditions, which limit the indications. Endovascular treatment is preferred in patients at high risk of surgery. If the anatomy is favourable, it may be offered to low-risk patients.\n\n==='''Follow-up after AAA exclusion'''===\nFollow-up after surgery depends on the type of operation:\n\n*the [[Monitoring of valve and vascular prosthesis wearers|prostheses]] used in conventional surgery may be complicated by anastomotic aneurysms requiring annual monitoring by Doppler ultrasound;\n*the [[Monitoring of wearers of vascular valves and prostheses|endoprostheses]] require long-term monitoring by ultrasound-Doppler or angio-CT to detect the presence of endoleaks, migration or limb folds which may be complicated by occlusion.\n\nThe survival rate of patients, even after surgery, is lower than that of the general population. This excess mortality is explained by advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors, associated atherosclerosis, COPD and other post-smoking pathologies.\n\nMedical monitoring of the patient undergoing surgery must detect the secondary occurrence or evolution of other localisations of aneurysmal disease or atheromatous disease.\n\nThis medical management is based on the control of risk factors and the prevention of cardiovascular risk by medication (statin, antiplatelet, ACE inhibitor / ARB2).",
