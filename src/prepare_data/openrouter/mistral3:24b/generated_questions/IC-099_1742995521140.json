There is sometimes a circadian cycle (seizures occur at fixed times, especially at night) and a circannual cycle (in the same season), as well as a link with alcohol consumption.\n\n<blockquote>\n*'''Chronic AVF''': in 10% of cases, attacks recur over the long term with no remission of more than three; this is then chronic AVF, a fearsome disease burdened with significant psychiatric comorbidity: depressive signs, agoraphobia and suicidal tendencies.\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''Table.
