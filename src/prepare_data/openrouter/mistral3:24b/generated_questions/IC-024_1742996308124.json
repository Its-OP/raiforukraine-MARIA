Prescribing and carrying out a blood transfusion]]''''\n\n- Biological work-up: CBC, coagulation, emergency IAR\n\n\n'''Monitoring is constant +++ (haemodynamics, diuresis, uterine tone, bleeding, biological tests (repeated as often as necessary)'''.\n\nIf the haemorrhage persists, the following may be suggested:\n\n- Intrauterine tamponade (Bakri balloon)\n\n- selective arterial embolisation (radiologist immediately available - patient hemodynamically stable - embolisation unit nearby)\n\n- or \"surgical ligation of the uterine arteries or hypogastric arteries\", or \"uterine compression techniques\".\n\nas a last resort: a \"haemostasis hysterectomy\". There should be no hesitation in carrying out this operation quickly in the event of unstable haemodynamics or established DIC, as this is the procedure that will save the patient's life.",
