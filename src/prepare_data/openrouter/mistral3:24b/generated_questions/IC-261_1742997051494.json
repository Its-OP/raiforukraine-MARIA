Know how to request an initial assessment (gasometry, chest scan, BAL, etc.) and an immunological work-up including antiGBM, ANCA, AAN, cryoglobulinaemia, complement).\n|Rubric=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=Eric Daugas,Bruno Moulin\n|Ordre=14}}\n\n'''D.    Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (GNRP)'''\n\nDefinition: a group of glomerulonephritic diseases expressed by a GNRP syndrome.\n\n* Rapidly progressive renal failure\n* Proteinuria\n* Haematuria\n\nSeriousness +++ => Diagnostic and therapeutic emergencies\n\nRenal biopsy must be performed as a matter of urgency ++.\n\nIt shows extra-capillary proliferative glomerulonephritis with extra-capillary crescents and determines the type of GNRP, which guides the aetiological diagnosis.\n\nTable 7: Classification and causes of GNRP\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Immunofluorescence topography of glomerular deposits\n|Causes\n|Biological tests useful for diagnosis\n|-\n|Type 1: Deposits of anti-MBG antibodies\n|Linear IgG deposits on MBG\n|- Goodpasture's disease\n|- Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-MBG)\n|-\n|Type 2: Immune deposits\n|Non-linear, endomembrane and granular deposits of Ig and/or complement.\n|- Primary N-IgA and rheumatoid purpura\n\n- Cryoglobulinemia\n\n- Systemic lupus\n\n- Glomerulonephritis caused by bacterial infections\n|- Cryoglobulin\n\n- NAA, anti-DNA\n\n- C3, C4 decrease except for NIgA\n|-\n|Type 3: \"Pauci-immune\" GN (absence of deposits)\n|No Ig deposits\n|- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n\n- Microscopic polyangiitis\n|- ANCA anti-MPO or anti-PR3\n|}\nANCA: anti-polynuclear cytoplasm antibodies; AAN: anti-nuclear antibodies; MPO: myeloperoxidase; PR3: proteinase 3\n\n\n'''1. GNRP type 1 or GNRP with linear IgG deposits: Goodpasture's disease'''\n\n* Due to the presence of a pathogenic circulating anti-MBG autoantibody fixed linearly along the MBG and the pulmonary alveolar membrane.\n* More common in young men, smokers and elderly subjects.\n* Often revealing pulmonary signs: cough, dyspnoea and respiratory distress, inconstant haemoptysis and, on imaging, bilateral infiltrates indicating alveolar haemorrhage (siderophages on BAL).\n* Renal manifestations: GNRP syndrome with severe renal failure, often oligo-anuric.\n* Diagnosis is based on detection of circulating anti-MBG antibodies and renal biopsy, which reveals GN with epithelial crescents and linear IgG deposits along the MBG.\n* Treatment is always symptomatic (fluid and electrolyte disorders, ARF, respiratory failure, anaemia) and specific (high-dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange and cyclosphosphamide).\n* This is a genuine diagnostic and therapeutic emergency, with life-threatening pulmonary failure and a high risk of permanent renal failure.\n\n\n'''2.        GNRP type 2 or GNRP with immune complex deposits''''\n\nMultiple causes (table 7) based on glomerular deposits of immunoglobulins and complement on renal biopsy.\n\n\n'''3.        GNRP type 3 or pauci-immune GNRP'''\n\n* Absence of immunoglobulin deposits in the glomeruli.\n* They are the renal involvement (sometimes isolated) of ANCA-associated vasculitides, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.\n* Diagnosis: table 9\n\nTable 9: Clinical and laboratory signs of pauci-immune GN\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|Granulomatosis with polyangiitis\n|Microscopic polyangiitis\n|-\n|General signs\n| colspan=\"2\" |- Fever, weight loss, arthralgias, myalgias, hyperleukocytosis, elevated CRP\n|-\n|Signs of vasculitis (inconstant)\n| colspan=\"2\" |- Vascular purpura, livedo\n\n- Cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis, pulmonary infiltrates (intra-alveolar haemorrhage)\n\n- Abdominal pain with bloody diarrhoea\n\n- Episcleritis\n\n- Single or multiple neuritis\n|-\n|Specific extrarenal signs\n|- crusty rhinitis, epistaxis, nasal and pharyngeal ulcerations, sinusitis, otitis\n\n- Lung nodules\n\n- Retro-orbital tumour\n|- No specific signs\n|-\n|Renal signs\n| colspan=\"2\" |- GNRP (rapidly progressive renal failure, proteinuria, haematuria)\n|-\n|Renal history\n| GN with extracapillary proliferation.
