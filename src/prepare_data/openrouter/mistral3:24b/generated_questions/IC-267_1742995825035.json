    "question": "What is the recommended approach for the initial treatment of severe hypokalaemia in a patient with cardiac disorders or increased QT interval?",
    "option_a": "Administer oral potassium supplements immediately to raise kalaemia levels.",
    "option_b": "Avoid glucose intake during the initial phase of correction to prevent insulin secretion.",
    "option_c": "Administer 0.5 to 1.5 g of potassium per hour intravenously and monitor kalaemia, heart rate, and infused vein.",
    "option_d": "Correct hypomagnesemia first before addressing hypokalaemia.",
