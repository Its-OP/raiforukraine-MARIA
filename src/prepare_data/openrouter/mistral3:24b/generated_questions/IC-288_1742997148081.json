They are composed of dilated venous lakes, small arterioles or arteriovenous shunts, supporting tissue (smooth muscle fibres and collagen tissue) and a lining epithelium. They form a porto-systemic anastomotic system and are located in the upper part of the anal canal (internal haemorrhoidal plexus) or peri anal (external haemorrhoidal plexus).",
