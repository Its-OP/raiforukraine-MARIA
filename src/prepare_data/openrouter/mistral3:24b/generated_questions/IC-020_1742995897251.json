Examples of quantiles are the median (divides values into 2 parts of the same size), quartiles (divides values into 4 parts of the same size) and percentiles (divides values into 100 parts of the same size).  \n# Dispersion parameters :\n#* Variance and standard deviation: The variance measures the dispersion of a set of values around their mean. It is the average of the squares of the deviations from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n#* Interquartile distance: difference between the third and first quartile.\n#* Range: difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.",
