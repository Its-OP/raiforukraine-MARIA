Clear and comprehensible information must be given to the parents, and written consent is recorded before the blood sample is taken ''([[Systematic neonatal screening SD-308|Neonatal screening]] systematic)''. Parents are only notified if there is an abnormal result requiring a follow-up test. This screening concerns 6 diseases:\n\n* '''Phenylketonuria''''\n\n* Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency \u2192 screening = increased phenylalanine dosage\n* Neonatal warning signs: no\n* Risk of psychomotor retardation in the absence of treatment (phenylalanine-controlled diet).\n\n* '''Congenital hypothyroidism'''\n\n* L-Thyroxine secretion deficiency due to thyroid dysgenesis (athyreosis, hypoplasia, ectopia) or hormonogenesis disorder (thyroid gland in place) \u2192 screening: elevation of TSH blood level\n* Neonatal warning signs: prolonged jaundice, constipation, hypotonia, sucking difficulties, wide fontanelles, hypothermia, macroglossia ''(Hypotonia / [[Severe infant malaise and unexpected infant death|infant malaise]])'''  Risk of psychomotor retardation, osteodystrophy, growth retardation in the absence of treatment (thyroid hormone replacement).\n\n* '''Congenital adrenal hyperplasia'''\n\n* 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (>95% of cases), leading to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and excess androgen production \u2192 screening: elevation of 17-OH-progesterone blood levels\n* Neonatal call signs: salt loss syndrome with vomiting, dehydration and metabolic disorders (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) '''([[Childhood dehydration SD-032|Dehydration]] of the child)'''. In girls, virilisation of the external genitalia visible from birth (''Discovery of a malformation of the genital tract)''.\n* Treatment: hydrocortisone replacement, fludrocortisone and sodium supplementation.\n\n* Cystic fibrosis\n\n* Mutations in the CFTR gene encoding a transmembrane protein regulating chloride ion transport \u2192 screening: increased immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) blood levels.\n* Neonatal signs: meconium ileus, retentional cholestatic jaundice.\n\n* '''Sickle cell disease'''\n\n* Structural abnormality of the \u03b2 chain of globin leading to the production of abnormal haemoglobin S \u2192 screening: haemoglobin electrophoresis (specific HbS band and absence of HbA band). Screening targeted at children whose parents are from high-prevalence countries: sub-Saharan Africa, West Indies, French Guiana, R\u00e9union, Mediterranean basin.\n* Neonatal signs: no\n\n* MCAD deficiency\n\n* Fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation abnormality \u2192 screening: measurement of octanoyl-carnitine (C8).\n* Neonatal signs: hypoglycaemic hypoketotic malaise (fasting hypoglycaemia failure to utilise fatty acids) (''[[Hypoglycaemia SD-209|Hypoglycaemia]]'')''",
