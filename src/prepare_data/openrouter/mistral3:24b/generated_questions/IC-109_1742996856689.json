Diagnosis is usually difficult and requires a thorough knowledge of the clinical expression of the different types of gait disorder. Clues in favour of a psychogenic disorder are :\n\n- sudden onset, spontaneous remission or paroxysmal onset\n\n- time inconsistency\n\n- inconsistency of clinical expression with the characteristics of a disorder\n\nof neurological origin\n\n- spontaneous modification of the disorder, incompatible with the anomaly initially observed\n\n- disappearance of the disorder by distraction manoeuvres. Conversely, the disorder increases when the subject's attention is focused on walking.\n\n- response to placebo, suggestion or psychotherapy\n\nThe incongruities that may be noted during the clinical examination and the course of the disease allow the diagnosis to be evoked, while avoiding considering as psychogenic a somatic disorder whose origin is considered to be \"organic\".",
