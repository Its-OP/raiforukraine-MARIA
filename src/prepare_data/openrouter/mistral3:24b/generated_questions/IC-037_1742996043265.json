Effectiveness is judged on the basis of complete expulsion without the need for surgery, and also on the rate of progressive pregnancy. Analgesic treatment must be associated.\n\nThe instrumental technique can be performed under local, loco-regional or general anaesthetic.\n<br />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''Medical abortion''''\n|'''Instrumental abortion'''\n|-\n|Maximum legal period\n|up to 9 weeks' gestation\n|Up to 16 weeks\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|Treatment regimen\n|Oral mifepristone followed by oral misoprostol 24 to 48 hours later.\n\n\nBefore 7 SA\n\n200 or 600 mg mifepristone 400 microg misoprostol\n\n\n\nBetween 7 and 9 SA\n\n200 mg mifepristone\n\n800 microg misoprostol\n|200 mg mifepristone per os 48 hours before the procedure\n\nOr\n\n400 microg misoprostol per os 3 to 4 hours before the procedure\n<br />The procedure is carried out by aspiration with a cannula after dilating the cervix with a bougie adapted to the gestational age.\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\n|}\nTable: main differences between the two abortion techniques",
