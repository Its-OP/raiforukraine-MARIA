It is an ''absolute therapeutic emergency'', where any delay in starting appropriate treatment exposes the patient to the risk of amputation or even death.\n\nThe diagnosis is clinical. Complementary examinations have little place if they delay revascularisation.\n\nThe ultimate criterion of severity is paralysis. Palpation of the pulses allows the topography of the arterial occlusion to be determined.\n[File:Ischemie Aigue.jpg|vignette]]\n\n\nAcute ischaemia is said to be complete if there is sensory-motor damage. It is characterised by :\n\n*intense spontaneous [[Pain in a limb (upper or lower) SD-071|''''']in a limb''''']], with a sudden or rapidly progressive onset, intense grinding pain, accompanied by functional impotence of the limb, poorly relieved by conventional analgesics\n*limb colour abnormalities SD-015|''''' pale, cold, livid or even cadaveric''''']]\n*abolition of peripheral pulses downstream of the occlusion.\n\nand signs of seriousness :\n\n*Pain on palpation of muscle masses, indicating muscle ischaemia,\n*hypoanaesthesia, which rapidly gives way to cutaneous anaesthesia,\n*and, above all, paralysis, with the inability to move the toes, which indicates the severity of the condition.\n\nThis picture can be summed up in the ''6P semiology'' of the Anglo-Saxons: Pain, Palor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis, Perishing cold.\n\nThe absence of motor deficit defines incomplete ischaemia.\n\nComplementary tests are of no help in making a positive diagnosis, which is exclusively clinical.\n\nThey should not delay emergency treatment in a specialist hospital. The emergency is absolute when the acute ischaemia is complete, i.e. when there is a motor deficit,\n\nRevascularisation must be carried out before the sixth hour following the onset of the clinical picture in order to reduce the ischaemic suffering time of the tissues and avoid neurological, muscular or cutaneous sequelae.\n\nAny delay in this management could lead to the development of an outdated form of ischaemia, characterised by the appearance of muscular rigidity, skin mottling and phlyctenes, necessitating first-line amputation to \"avoid death\".",
