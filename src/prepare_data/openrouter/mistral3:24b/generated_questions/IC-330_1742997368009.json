This binding leads to a reduction in the inflow of calcium into the cardiomyocyte (inotropic, dromotropic and negative chronotropic effect) and/or into the smooth muscle cell (peripheral, coronary and cerebral vasodilatation).\n\n=='''Indications'''==\n\n*Hypertension, as first-line treatment\n*Stable angina\n*Verapamil and diltiazem: paroxysmal junctional tachycardias and certain supraventricular rhythm disorders.\n*Verapamil: post-infarction if beta-blockers are contraindicated\n*Nifedipine: symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon\n*Nimodipine: prevention of neurological deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm after meningeal haemorrhage.\n\n==''Undesirable effects'''==\n\n==='''''Dihydropyridines and less frequently verapamil and diltiazem'''''===\n\n*Flushing, headaches\n*Peripheral oedema\n\n==='''''Specific to verapamil and diltiazem'''''===\n\n*Bradycardia, conduction disorders\n*Heart failure\n\n==''Drug interactions'''==\n\n==='''''Dihydropyridines'''''===\nAvoid grapefruit juice, which can cause overdose.\n\n==='''''Verapamil and diltiazem'''''===\n\n*Pharmacokinetic interactions: CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, responsible for multiple drug interactions (atorvastatin and simvastatin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, ergot derivatives, dabigatran, etc.).\n*Pharmacodynamic interactions: contraindicated in combination with beta-blockers, bradycardia drugs, antiarrhythmics, etc.\n\n==''Contraindications'''==\n\n==='''''Verapamil and diltiazem'''''===\n\n*Heart failure\n*Bradycardia, sinus dysfunction and untethered second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks\n*Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n*Hypotension\n\n==Monitoring methods ==\nClinical<br />",
