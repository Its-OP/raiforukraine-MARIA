Intra-operative pain is prevented by anaesthesia (general or loco-regional), while post-operative pain requires an analgesic strategy.\n\n- Inflammatory pain\" is often acute, as in renal colic (due to distension and inflammatory reaction of the urinary tract upstream of an obstacle) or tissue infection, or more prolonged, as in arthritis flare-ups in the context of chronic joint damage (rheumatoid arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, gout).\n\n- Mechanical pain, linked to movement, either when walking in a context of ''osteoarthritis, or spinal joint overload'' (cervicalgia, dorsalgia, lumbago) or during ''prolonged joint stress'', or during ''certain treatments, particularly physiotherapy''.\n\n- The \"pain of cancer\" (see below).\n\n- Pain induced by treatment (see above).\n\n\n'''<u>Diagnosis and main features</u>''''\n\n- Unlike neuropathic pain, nociceptive pain does not necessarily have a specific symptomatology.\n\n- They are generally located opposite the lesion and may be associated with inflammatory signs, particularly in the event of acute pain or acute painful flare-ups of a chronic pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis flare-ups).",
