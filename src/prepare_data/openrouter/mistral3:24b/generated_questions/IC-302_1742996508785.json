This involves training doctors, who must know how to examine their patient's integument in its entirety, spot suspicious lesions and refer to an expert correspondent in case of doubt.\n\nIt is essential to combine this with information and education on early melanoma screening for carers (nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, etc.), the general population and those most at risk of melanoma.",
