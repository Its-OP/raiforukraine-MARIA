There may be several such measures for the same disease, and they may aim to control the reservoir, interrupt the chain of transmission and/or act on the susceptibility of the host.\n\n'''1- Examples of checking tanks or their exit doors'''\n\n*Use of a condom,\n*Expulsion from school or a community centre, time off work,\n*Geographical isolation of carriers as part of additional precautions during treatment,\n*Veterinary measures if the reservoir is an animal,\n*Environmental sanitation, water treatment, eradication of insect and mollusc larvae.\n\n'''2- Main barriers to transmission: contact, air, droplets'''\n\n*Hand and respiratory hygiene in the community,\n*Domestic hygiene,\n*Quality and safety of care.

Patient safety. Risk management. Undesirable events associated with care (EIAS). Quality approach and assessment of professional practices|Standard precautions (SP)]]''''\n\n*PS must be applied on a daily basis by all healthcare professionals, for all care, in all places, and for all patients, whatever their infection status.\n\n*SPs reduce the risk of cross-transmission of infectious agents between carers, patients and the environment, or through exposure to a biological product of human origin (blood, secretions, excreta, etc.). They contribute to the ''[[Quality and safety of care. Patient safety. Risk management. Undesirable events associated with care (EIAS). Quality approach and assessment of professional practices|prevention of healthcare-associated infections, control of the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and healthcare safety]]'' (carer/patient) during patient care.\n\n*The prerequisites for the application of the SPs are up-to-date vaccinations, correct personal hygiene, clean working clothes that clear the forearms, zero jewellery on the hands and forearms and tied-up hair if it is long.\n\n*The recommendations concerning PS concern :\n**L''''hygi\u00e8ne des mains''' favorisant la d\u00e9sinfection des mains avec une solution hydroalcoolique,\n**Wearing personal protective equipment (gloves, protection of clothing with a plastic apron or overblouse and of the face with a surgical mask and protective goggles),\n**Respiratory hygiene measures, ''''\n**Prevention of faecal peril (''excreta management''),\n**Prevention of accidents involving exposure to blood.\n**Measures to manage environmental contamination.\n\n'''6- [[Quality and safety of care.

Quality approach and assessment of professional practices|Complementary precautions]]''''\n\nWhen a specific infectious risk is identified, \"additional precautions\" must be added to the SPs to control this risk.\n\n*In the case of contact with a patient presenting a transmissible infection through contact (scabies, Clostridioides difficile diarrhoea, carriage of multi-resistant or highly resistant bacteria), there are recommendations for additional contact precautions.\n*When in contact with a patient presenting a transmissible respiratory or ENT infection, there are recommendations for additional droplet precautions (PCG) or air precautions (PCA), including wearing a suitable mask (surgical mask for PCG, FFP2 mask for PCA).\n\nRecommendations concerning standard and additional precautions are available on the website of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise d'Hygi\u00e8ne Hospitali\u00e8re: '''https://www.sf2h.net/publications'''\n\n\n\n<br />",
