This is why :\n\n- venous ports should be removed as soon as possible to limit iatrogenicity;\n\n- their indication and maintenance must be reviewed on a daily basis in the light of the treatments and monitoring required.\n\n\n'''Complications during follow-up'''\n\nThese complications may be locoregional or general.\n\nThey can be mechanical, thrombotic or infectious.\n\nTheir frequency depends on :\n\n- location;\n\n- the clinical context;\n\n- the time required to install the equipment.\n\n'''''Infectious complications'''''\n\nInfection of the equipment can lead to bacteremia (\"''[[Positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]''') and secondary foci. Early infections are most often related to insertion and late infections to handling: importance of asepsis +++ during insertion and use (\"''[[Preventing healthcare-associated infections SD-311|preventing healthcare-associated infections]]''\").\n\nInfectious complications can take the form of :\n\n* inflammatory syndrome<u>prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach</u>;\n* CRP elevation<u>prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach</u>;\n* suppuration at the puncture site\n* erythema along the venous pathway or adjacent to the infusion chamber;\n* Isolated fever disappearing after removal of the equipment (''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]''');\n* fever when using the equipment ('''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]'''');\n* bacterial discharge;\n* dermo-hypodermatitis;\n* secondary septic fixation (endocarditis, deep abscesses, etc.);\n* bacteremia, septicaemia ('''[[positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]'''').\n\n'''''Les complications m\u00e9caniques'''''\n\n- central catheter malposition;\n\n- catheter dysfunction;\n\n- material rupture with catheter segment migration;\n\n- parietal vascular perforations (associated with extravasation).\n\nPuncture of implantable chambers can be complicated:\n\n* haematoma, sometimes compressive;\n* extravasation in the event of inadequate needle positioning, a source of tissue necrosis through diffusion of irritant product.\n\n''''' Thrombotic complications'''''\n\nThere are two types of catheter-associated thrombosis:\n\n- fibrous sleeve around the catheter;\n\n- mural thrombosis.",
