This is the doctor's right to refuse to carry out a medical act that is authorised by law but that he or she considers contrary to his or her own personal, professional or ethical convictions. This is only possible under certain conditions strictly defined by law.\n\nDoctors may refuse treatment for professional or personal reasons, for example in the event of a disagreement with a patient, aggressive behaviour, or incompetence in view of the specific nature of an illness, etc. However, if they refuse to carry out their mission, they must inform the patient immediately and pass on to the practitioner designated by the patient any information that may be useful in continuing the treatment.\n\nA so-called specific \"conscience clause\", introduced in 1975 by the Veil law on voluntary termination of pregnancy, is the reservation under which a doctor or medical auxiliary may refuse to carry out or assist in a voluntary or medical termination of pregnancy, or sterilisation.\n\nIn certain cases, refusal of treatment is compulsory: in the name of the principle of proportionality, the medical act must pursue a therapeutic necessity and the benefits must outweigh the risks; in the name of legal and ethical obligations, the care envisaged must not exceed the practitioner's competence.\n\nHowever, as a general rule, no one may be discriminated against in access to prevention or care (cf. Code of Medical Ethics, art. 7).\n\nThe Criminal Code makes it an offence to discriminate against people for any reason, including because of their state of health or disability. Any healthcare professional who refuses to provide care to a patient because of his or her origin, sex, family situation, state of health, disability, morals, sexual orientation, age, political opinions, trade union activities, membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion, or detention status, is liable to disciplinary, criminal or civil penalties.\n\nToday, the most numerous cases of direct or indirect discrimination concern patients receiving universal health cover (CMU) or state medical aid (AME). Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>]]\n\n\n'''''Patient refusal of care'''''\n\nA patient's refusal to accept treatment highlights the tension between two fundamental ethical principles: the \"principle of beneficence\", which requires that the patient should not be harmed and that the patient should benefit, and the \"principle of autonomy\", which requires that the patient's wishes should be respected.\n\nThe patient's rights, first and foremost the right to respect for his or her wishes, make the issue of refusal of care by the patient particularly acute: \"Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>\". According to a paternalistic conception of medicine, the patient, made vulnerable by his suffering, cannot conceive of or decide on his own good. If the patient refuses care, there is a risk that it will only express his distress, and not his rational and autonomous will. He should therefore be protected from himself. On the other hand, according to a conception of medicine based on the principle of autonomy, refusal of care is an expression of the will of a person who, despite his or her illness, remains entitled to make the decisions that concern him or her.\n\nThe law of 4 March 2002 on patients' rights and the quality of the healthcare system reflects the search for a compromise between the principle of beneficence and the principle of autonomy.\n\nIt places the person's consent at the heart of any act of care. The person must be informed of his/her state of health, the care proposed and the consequences of any refusal of care on his/her state of health [[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote3sym|<sup>3</sup>]]. He/she has the right to have his/her wishes respected by consenting to investigations and care or by refusing them, even if this refusal involves a risk to his/her health or life[[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote4sym|<sup>4</sup>]]. The refusal must be repeated and recorded in the medical record. When the person is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, no intervention or investigation may be carried out, except in an emergency or when it is impossible, without the trusted support person, the family or, failing this, a close relative having been consulted. The consent of the minor or adult under guardianship must be sought, even if the agreement of the person with parental authority or the guardian is necessary. However, if refusing treatment could have serious consequences for the health of the minor or person under guardianship, the doctor will provide the necessary treatment.\n\nThe law reveals a tension. It promotes a model of concerted, joint decision, taken by mutual agreement between the doctor and the patient: the doctor, in the light of his or her skills, gives an opinion on the condition and the therapeutic plan, and the patient, in the light of the medical proposals, makes a choice. It is \"with the healthcare professional\" that decisions are made. Nevertheless, the doctor must do everything in his power to convince the patient to accept essential care if his life is in danger - which calls into question respect for the patient's wishes. If there is a life-threatening emergency and the doctor is unable to convince the patient of the need for treatment, he or she cannot be accused of providing treatment against the patient's will. Case law subordinates the principle of respect for the patient's wishes to the principle of preservation of life in cases of refusal of blood transfusion, in an emergency situation, by Jehovah's Witnesses. Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote5sym|<sup>5</sup>]]\n\nUltimately, refusal of care is expressed when people who are at the end of life or not [[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote6sym|<sup>6</sup>]] and who are subject to extreme physical and/or mental suffering, refuse treatment and life support and ask to be helped to die.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti Act of 2016 provides a partial response to this problem. It attempts to place the patient at the heart of the decision-making process. It prohibits unreasonable obstinacy. It obliges doctors to respect patients' wishes to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness. It affirms the patient's right to benefit from deep and continuous sedation until death when the prognosis is vital in the short term. It makes advance directives binding on doctors. In the absence of advance directives, account must be taken of the patient's wishes, as expressed by the trusted support person or, failing this, by close relatives.\n\nStopping treatment does not mean stopping care, nor does it call into question the caring nature of medicine, defined by concern for the sick person. Whereas treatment combats the disease and its effects, care - which is based on the treatment(s) - responds to the fundamental, global and individual needs of the vulnerable person, who is not only alive, but also feeling, suffering, thinking and involved in social relationships.\n\nFrom an ethical point of view, a refusal of treatment cannot be considered as a refusal of care. Hearing and respecting refusal of treatment is part of the care activity and obliges us to take care. Care requires an understanding of the diversity of situations in which treatment is refused (emergency situations requiring, for example, a blood transfusion or a caesarean section, heavy therapies such as chemotherapy, refusal of treatment in psychiatry, at the end of life, refusal of treatment for pregnant women, etc.) and the diversity of the reasons behind it: religious beliefs, cultural representations and values, social conditions, life concepts and projects, etc. Respecting patient autonomy does not mean submitting passively to a conscience that may be altered by suffering or depression. It means maintaining the ability to listen, understand and relate that can help to bring about a truly autonomous will and find an individualised solution. Guided by concern, the care relationship maintains the cared-for person in the exchange, sharing and community of human beings.
