This agent may be part of the host's usual flora (commensal flora) or not (opportunistic agent). In this case, the transition from colonisation to infection results from a disruption in the balance between the infectious agent and the host due to an alteration in the host's local defences (cutaneous invasion or mucosal alteration) or general immune defences ([[Fever in an immunocompromised patient|opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients]]).\n\nAn ''infection'' is said to be ''endogenous'' when the reservoir is the microbiota (all commensal microorganisms hosted in the skin, mucous membranes and digestive tract).\n\nAn ''infection is said to be exogenous'' when the reservoir of infectious agents is located outside the infected host. The ''reservoir'' can then be :\n\n*Human: this is the most common situation. A person infected or colonised by an infectious agent (e.g. ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'') transmits it to other individuals.\n*'''Animal''': the infectious disease is then a [[Zoonoses|zoonose]] (e.g. non-typical salmonellosis, listeriosis).\n*Environmental'': the reservoir is soil (telluric germ, e.g. tetanus), air (e.g. aspergillosis) or water (aquatic germ, e.g. legionellosis).",
