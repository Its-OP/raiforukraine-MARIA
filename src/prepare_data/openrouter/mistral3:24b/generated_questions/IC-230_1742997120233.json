NB= Troponins are also elevated in cases of myocarditis associated with pericarditis.\n\nIt should be noted that elevation of troponin alone is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of ACS (the context and the clinic must be taken into account, since troponin may be elevated in the context of other pathologies).\n\n- <u>D-dimer:</u> in case of low or moderate suspicion of PE (PE ruled out if D-dimer normal), rule out aortic dissection if also normal. Do not confirm any diagnosis\n\n- CRP (C-reactive protein): indicator of inflammatory syndrome, of interest especially for pericarditis but non-specific '''(elevation of C-reactive protein, CRP)''''\n\n- <u>Blood gas</u> '''(analysis of a blood gas result)''': especially if respiratory distress, shunt effect suggestive of PE",
