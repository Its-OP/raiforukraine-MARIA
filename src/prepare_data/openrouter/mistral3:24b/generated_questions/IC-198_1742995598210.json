Various elements of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with gout: obesity with increased abdominal circumference ('>'' 94 cm in European men and 88 cm in women), arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia with reduced HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia.\n\nPatients with gout should therefore be considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, which explains the excess mortality observed!\n\nGout occurring before the age of 35 is possible in 10-15% of cases. It should be investigated for a genetic origin with abnormalities in the genes encoding uric acid transporters in the renal tubules (''URAT1'', ''ABCG2'').\n\n\n- secondary to :\n\n- chronic renal failure, which reduces uric acid excretion;\n\n- several years' use of a drug that reduces urinary uric acid excretion, particularly thiazide diuretics, furosemide or etacrynic acid, acetazolamide, but also cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin or certain anti-tuberculosis drugs (ethambutol and pyrazinamide).",
