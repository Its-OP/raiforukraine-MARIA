In the event of an emergency, the pharmacist must inform the prescriber as soon as possible.\n\n===Special case of generics===\nSince 1999, pharmacists have had the right - under certain conditions - to [[Know how to explain the prescription of a generic drug or biosimilar 2C-326-PC-A02|substitute a prescribed drug with a generic drug]] belonging to the same ''generic group''. The aim of substitution is to generate savings for the Assurance Maladie.\n\n==Role of nurses==\nAccording to article ''R4312-42 du CSP:''' ''l'infirmier '''applique''' et '''respecter''' la prescription m\u00e9dicale qui, sauf urgence, est '''\u00e9crite''', quantitative et qualitative, dat\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e. They ask the prescriber for \"additional information\" whenever they consider it useful, particularly if they feel they have not been adequately informed. If the nurse has any ''doubt'' about the prescription, he checks it with the prescriber or, if this is not possible, with another member of the profession concerned. In the event of i'''mpossibility of verification'' and of ''''manifest''' and ''''imminent''' risks to the patient's health, he shall, by virtue of his own competence, adopt the <nowiki/>'''attitude which best safeguards the patient's health''', and shall not cause the patient to take any unjustified risk.'' <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033496651</ref>\n\n===Special case of hospitals===\nThe role of nurses is different in the hospital circuit, insofar as nurses are systematically involved, normally after pharmaceutical validation, with the medical prescription for all types of medicines, whereas in outpatient medicine, nurses are only involved after the prescription for certain medicines, particularly injectables. Generally speaking, in hospitals, most nursing acts relating to medicines, such as the administration of medicines, fall into the category of delegated acts, requiring a medical prescription (R4311-7 CSP) and not the specific role (R4311-5 CSP) of nursing staff.\n\n==Responsibility of those involved downstream of the medical prescription===\nOn several occasions, the French courts have ruled that the \"execution of a prescription\" entails the \"liability\" of those involved downstream of the prescription and not that of the prescriber alone.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the courts have been able to ''simultaneously'' engage the liability of the ''prescriber'' and either a ''pharmacist'' or a ''nurse'', whether before the ''civil'' or ''administrative'' courts (compensation for harm suffered by the victim in outpatient or hospital medicine) or before the ''criminal courts'' (punishment for an offence committed in both the private and public sectors), in particular for errors in dosage, indication or the name of the medicine.\n\nIn addition, these professionals report to a '''professional order''' which can also '''sanction''' them (disciplinary responsibility) for failure to comply with the ethical rules laid down in their respective codes of ethics.<references />",
