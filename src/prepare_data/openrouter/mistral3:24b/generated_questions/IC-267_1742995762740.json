    "option_a": "Administer IV sodium bicarbonate to rapidly raise pH > 7.20 and bicarbonate levels > 10 mmol/L, using the formula: quantity HCO3- (mmol) = \u2206 [HCO3-] \u00d7 0.3 \u00d7 weight (kg).",
    "option_b": "Alkalinisation is always recommended in ketoacidosis to correct the acid-base imbalance.",
