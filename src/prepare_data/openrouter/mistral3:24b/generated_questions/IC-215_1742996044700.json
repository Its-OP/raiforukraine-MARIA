Note that the meningeal syndrome may be absent.\n\n- Necrotic and/or ecchymotic and/or extensive purpura (physical examination to be carried out with the patient in underwear).\n\n\nVital prognosis is at stake (death in 20% of cases under treatment) and treatment is urgent and hospital-based. It consists of :\n\n- As a matter of urgency, and before any examination: intra-muscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection of antibiotics (preferably 3rd generation cephalosporin: cefotaxime or ceftriaxone);\n\n- Perform blood cultures (if possible and without delaying the injection of the first dose of antibiotic);\n\n- Carry out a biological check-up (detailed below);\n\n- The use of droplet precautions (surgical mask) during treatment.\n\n\nLumbar puncture is \"contraindicated\" until the coagulation disorder has been corrected.\n\n\n== Haemorrhagic emergency: profound thrombocytopenia ==\n\n\nProfound thrombocytopenia is defined as a circulating platelet count of less than 20,000 platelets/mm<sup>3</sup> and is associated with a significant and serious risk of haemorrhage (''[[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]]'').\n\n\nThe signs of seriousness to look for are\n\n- Purpura of the mucous membranes: haemorrhagic bullae of the mucous membranes (endo-buccal), gingivorrhagia reflecting a high risk of haemorrhage.\n\n- Epistaxis, macroscopic haematuria.\n\n- Meno-metrorrhagia ('''[[Abnormal genital bleeding (excluding known pregnancy) SD-112|abnormal genital bleeding]] (excluding known pregnancy)''').\n\n- Digestive haemorrhage ('''[[Melena/rectorrhagia SD-010|melena/rectorrhagia]]''', haematemesis '''([[Blood emission through mouth SD-014|blood emission through mouth]]))''''\n\n- Signs suggesting intracranial bleeding (headache, confusion, coma, focal deficit, convulsive seizure).\n\nTreatment depends on the cause and the degree of urgency.",
