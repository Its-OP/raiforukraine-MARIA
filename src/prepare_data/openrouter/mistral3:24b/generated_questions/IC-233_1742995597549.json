Other valvulopathies are currently being evaluated (in particular IA in cases of contraindication or very high surgical risk).\n\n* Aortic stenosis:\n** The decision is always based on a multidisciplinary meeting (\"Heart team\") comprising at least one cardiac surgeon and one interventional cardiologist (an \"imaging\" cardiologist and a geriatrician are sometimes necessary).\n** Patients who are candidates for TAVI are those with a life expectancy of > 1 year and :\n*** in the event of surgical contraindication (porcelain aorta, hostile thorax, serious co-morbidities)\n*** in patients at high risk of surgery\n*** indications have also been validated in patients at intermediate risk > 75 years if the anatomy is favourable to TAVI via the femoral route.\n*** Likely to be extended in the short term to low-risk patients > 65-70 years old\n* Mitral insufficiency:''''\n** Mitraclip is indicated for organic MI in patients contraindicated for surgery (e.g. LVEF < 30%) or at high surgical risk.\n** Mitraclip is indicated for functional MI in patients with persistent CHF despite optimisation of medical treatment for CHF and causative heart disease.",
