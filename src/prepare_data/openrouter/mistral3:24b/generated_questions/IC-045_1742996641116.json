It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It affects one in every 4,700 births.  One subject in 35 is a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in France is F508del.  Life expectancy at birth is over 40 years.\n\nSituations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis\n\n- Ultrasound monitoring\n\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be raised during ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy when a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign which may reveal a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in around 5% of cases. This risk is increased if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by an absence of visualization of the gallbladder. A study of the CFTR gene is then carried out in the couple. If mutations in the gene are detected in one or both of the couple's partners, the mutations are tested in the foetus using an amniotic fluid sample.  \n\n- Family history of cystic fibrosis\n\nBoth parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation.\n\nThe risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhoea, or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhoea. Once the foetal DNA has been extracted, molecular biology is used to determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is only known for one parent, a full study of the CFTR gene must be carried out for the other spouse to determine the risk.\n\nOne of the parents has cystic fibrosis\n\nA parent with cystic fibrosis must pass on one of the two mutations he or she carries. It is necessary to determine the status of the spouse by carrying out an exhaustive study of the CFTR gene.  If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",
