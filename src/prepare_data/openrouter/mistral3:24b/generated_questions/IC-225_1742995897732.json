These lead to an increase in ischaemia, the appearance of permanent critical ischaemia and trophic disorders. If the diagnosis is made too late, it may be impossible to revascularise the lower limb and amputations may be necessary.\n\n==II) Acute limb ischaemia==)\nAcute limb ischaemia can also be very sudden, with the onset of [[Limb pain (upper or lower) SD-071|'''''intense pain''''']].\n\nIt is a medico-surgical emergency: it is a medico-surgical therapeutic emergency because it threatens the patient's vital prognosis and/or the functional prognosis of the limb.\n\nIt requires rapid treatment in a specialised facility.\n\nDespite appropriate treatment, the overall prognosis remains poor. Acute ischaemia is associated with 10% of deaths, 25% of amputations, 15% of sequelae and only 50% of good results.",
