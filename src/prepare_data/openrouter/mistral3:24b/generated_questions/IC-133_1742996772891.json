It is used to determine the ability of the person being assessed to carry out everyday activities involving the body. It is a short scale, easy to use and highly predictive of morbidity and mortality. The items studied are body care, dressing, using the toilet, transfers, continence and eating. A score of 6 indicates complete autonomy, while any loss of a point indicates dependence, with a greater risk of adverse events.\n\n- IADL: Instrumental activities of daily living. Instrumental activities of daily living require the use of so-called instrumental cognitive functions, such as arithmetic and the development of executive strategies. This scale is highly predictive of an elderly person's ability to live alone at home. The items studied are the ability to use a telephone, do the shopping, prepare a meal, do the housework, wash clothes, prepare for a trip, take medication or manage a personal budget. The subject assesses his or her own abilities, but it may be useful to check with family and friends or to use role-playing.",
