Because it passes freely through cell membranes, it increases osmolality without causing water movement).\n\n*At steady state, osmolality is identical between the extracellular and intracellular compartments and is equal to approximately 285 mOsm/Kg H2O.\n*'''Estimation of urinary osmolality:''''  Uosm = [Na+ + K+ ] x 2 + urea (mmol/L)\n\n*A disorder of intracellular hydration is the consequence of a non-zero water balance (positive in intracellular hyperhydration [ICH] and negative in intracellular dehydration [IDH]), and is necessarily accompanied by a change in osmolality (hypoosmolality in ICH and hyperosmolality in ICD) and therefore in natraemia, which is the main determinant of osmolality (hyponatremia in ICH and hypernatremia in ICD). It may be isolated or accompanied by a disorder of extracellular hydration.\n*The kidney's capacity to excrete free water is important. It depends on the capacity to suppress hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of ADH and the maximum dilution capacity of the kidney. Under normal conditions, the kidney is capable of lowering urinary osmolality to a minimum of 60 mOsm/Kg of H20. Pure water cannot be eliminated on its own, so a minimum supply of osmoles in the urine is required (in practice 60 mOsm/Kg). This can lead to a positive water balance and hypo-osmolality (''and therefore hyponatremia''):\n**when the maximum physiological water excretion capacity is exceeded, for example in the case of potomania.\n***For a standard osmolar intake of 600 mOsm/day, a positive water balance (dilution hyponatremia due to the inability to eliminate all the water drunk) occurs for a water intake of more than 10 litres (potomania). To eliminate 1 litre of water with a urinary osmolality of 60 mOsm/kg, 60 mOsm are required. To eliminate 10 litres, 600 mOsm are required.\n***For an osmolar intake of 120 mOsm/day (low intake, situation observed in the case of diets low in animal proteins and salt, anorexia nervosa), a positive water balance appears for a water intake of more than 2 litres (tea and toast syndrome).\n**When water excretion is reduced by altering the maximum diluting power of urine. There are 2 main situations:\n***Low ADH associated with a primary renal defect in water excretion as in advanced chronic renal failure (GFR \u2264 20 mL/min),\n***high ADH:\n****Par '''appropriate secretion of ADH in hypovolaemic situations:'''\n*****to true hypovolaemia (all causes of extracellular dehydration),\n*****with \"effective\" hypovolaemia (associated with extracellular hyperhydration):\n******congestive heart failure,\n******cirrhosis,\n******nephrotic syndrome,\n****Par ''inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH)'': inappropriate because the blood volume is normal and there is no braking associated with the drop in osmolality.",
