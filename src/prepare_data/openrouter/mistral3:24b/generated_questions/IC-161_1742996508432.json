If the BU is positive on a bag that has been left in place for more than 30 minutes, an A/R catheterisation may be suggested.\n==IMAGING EXAMINATIONS==\nRenal and urinary tract ultrasound should be performed systematically for the first episode of ANP (to look for uropathy and lesions of the renal parenchyma), or in the event of recurrent cystitis.\n\nCystography should be discussed.\n\nOther examinations (scintigraphy, MRI) are reserved for special cases (specialist opinion)<br />.\n\n==BIOLOGICAL TESTS\nIf NAP is suspected\n\n*Inflammatory markers\n**CPT: associated with risk of UTR\n**CRP: may help to correct a diagnosis if CRP is low after more than 24-48 hours of fever.\n*Blood culture: < 3 months and/or signs of sepsis\n*LP: systematic if blood culture positive, broad indication before 6 weeks (risk of associated bacteremia and secondary meningitis)",
