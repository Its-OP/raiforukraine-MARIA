This test combines a biochemical assay of immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) (a sensitive but not very specific marker of pancreatic damage) with a search for the most frequent mutations in the CFTR gene. The combination of an elevated IRT and two causal mutations in a newborn indicates a diagnosis. Screening for the disease enables early treatment in specialised centres (CRCM) and informed genetic counselling.",
