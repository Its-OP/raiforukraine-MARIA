Second step: characterise whether the metabolic acidosis is simple, mixed or complex''''\n\n*Simple: PaCO2 = expected PaCO2\n*Mixed: PaCO2 > expected PaCO2\n*Complex: PaCO2 < expected PaCO2\n\n'''3.     Third step: determine the plasma anion gap: BP = [Na<sup>+</sup>] + [K<sup>+</sup>] - [Cl<sup>-</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup>] = 16 \u00b1 4 mmol/L''''\n\nVariations in BP make it possible to assess whether the anion accompanying the excess H<sup>+</sup> (and therefore the loss of HCO3<sup>-</sup>) is chlorine (the anion measured) or indosed anions.\n\n*Acidosis with normal anion gap (HCl gain): renal or digestive loss of HCO3<sup>-</sup> -->decrease in HCO3<sup>-</sup> compensated by a proportional increase in Cl<sup>-</sup> (HCl gain) --> hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.\n*Acidosis with high anion gap (BP > 20 mmol/L): addition of H+ associated with an indosed anion (AH gain)--> drop in [HCO3<sup>-</sup>] replaced by an unmeasured anion (eg lactate).\n\n'''4.     To diagnose metabolic acidosis with increased plasma anion gap:''''\n\n*Lactic acidosis (lactate assay): acidosis and BP secondary to lactic acid accumulation:\n**Shock with tissue hypoxia,\n**Biguanide toxicity (in the event of overdosage in renal failure)\n*Ketoacidosis (determination of ketonemia; ketonuria by urine dipstick): acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of ketoacids:\n**Diabetic ketoacidosis,\n**Less common: alcoholic ketoacidosis, fasting ketoacidosis.\n*Severe renal failure (acute or chronic): acidosis secondary to failure of the kidney to eliminate H<sup>+</sup> ions and BP secondary to accumulation of anions not eliminated by the kidney (organic acids, phosphate ion, sulphate ion...). The BP is not very high (< 26 mmol/L).\n*Intoxication with an exogenous acid: acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of the exogenous acid:\n**salicylate, ethylene glycol, methanol.\n\n'''5.     Make the diagnosis of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (normal plasma anion gap)'''\n\n*Digestive loss of bicarbonate: diarrhoea, ileostomy, etc.\n*Renal tubular acidosis.",
