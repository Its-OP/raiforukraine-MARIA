A T2* sequence may be requested to identify bleeding or a hyposignal CVT. A fat-sat sequence (fat saturation) and MRA of the ASD are required to detect a cervical arterial dissection.\n\n- If access to MRI is limited, a brain scan without and then with injection of contrast medium and an angioscan of the ASD will be performed. If there is no diagnosis after the scan and the headache persists, an MRI scan should be performed to look for lesions that are not easily visible on the scan (CVT, PRES, pituitary necrosis and intracranial hypotension).\n\n- If imaging does not provide a definitive diagnosis and the headache persists, an LP should be discussed to look for meningitis or a CSF pressure disorder.\n<br />\n\n===='''3.

Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak?

In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5/1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing;\n\n'''115.

Before 11 weeks' gestation, the incidence of foetal infection is around 90%. This frequency then decreases to 25% between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation, then increases again to reach 100% at the end of the pregnancy. If conception takes place after the rash, the risk of foetal infection is probably low, since the rash coincides with the appearance of antibodies and the end of viremia. When maternal infection occurs before 11 weeks' gestation, the risk of major foetal anomalies is very high (around 90%). After 18 weeks' gestation, the risk is virtually nil. Between 11 and 18 weeks' gestation, the frequency of abnormalities varies.\n\nThere are two situations\n\n- '''Polymalformative syndrome''' including neurological anomalies (microcephaly), ophthalmic anomalies (cataracts, microphthalmia, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy, chorioretinitis), auditory anomalies (sensorineural deafness), cardiac anomalies (stenosis of the peripheral pulmonary artery, persistence of the ductus arteriosus or interventricular communication, etc.). It can be complicated by miscarriage or foetal death in utero;\n\n- Progressive congenital rubella'' which corresponds to chronic generalised viral infection. It reflects the persistence of the virus in the blood, which may persist for several months: these newborns are highly contagious. This form may be asymptomatic, particularly in the case of maternal infection after 18 months' gestation. When it is symptomatic, growth retardation, thrombocytopenic purpura, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, convulsions and radiological bone abnormalities may be observed. These multi-visceral lesions may regress or leave sequelae. The long-term prognosis for congenital rubella that is symptomatic at birth is guarded, especially as regards psychomotor and auditory development.\n\nThe WHO defines congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) and congenital rubella infection (CRI) as follows:\n\n- A case of \"CRS\" is a child with 2 complications from group A (cataract and/or congenital glaucoma, congenital heart disease, sensorineural deafness, pigmentary retinopathy) or 1 from group A + one from group B (purpura, splenomegaly, microcephaly, psychomotor retardation, meningoencephalitis, bone mineralisation anomalies, early neonatal jaundice). The diagnosis can be confirmed by testing for specific IgM antibodies in the neonatal period.\n\n- A case of ''CRI'' is a child who does not fit into the previous definition and who has positive specific IgM in the neonatal period.",

Whether or not to continue the pregnancy on the basis of these elements may be discussed at the Pluridisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis, after the couple has been informed.\n\nThe second situation consists of adapting the treatment during a pre-conception consultation with the best known treatment for pregnancy. For this, the practitioner can be assisted by the regional pharmacovigilance services and by the prescriber of the treatment (organ specialist).\n\nIn the third situation, the imputability of a treatment requires the chronology of its administration to be retraced, if possible with the dosage, and reported to a pharmacovigilance centre.\n\nAll these data provide valuable assistance to the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM), enabling it to establish, in conjunction with preclinical studies in animals, whether or not the product is suitable for use during pregnancy.\n\nAdvice on the teratogenicity of medicines can be sought from the teratogenicity reference centre (CRAT).\n\n'''312.

The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, the infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy, or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or in the family.\n\nThe risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately :\n\n- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labour ;\n\n- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding the work ;\n\n- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions ;\n\n- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes.\n\nThe risk is therefore minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes, but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of cases of neonatal herpes are ultimately observed in this situation. This is because :\n\n- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes;\n\n- but 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently: genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognised.\n\nVHB\n\nOne per cent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:\n\n- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test);( if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended.\n\n- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies[VFC(2] .\n\n- In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated.\n\nTransmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.     \n\nSero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended and the neonatologist should be informed.\n\n'''HIV'''\n\nMother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.\n\nVertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:\n\n- pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the foetus via the placenta.\n\n- intrapartum (infection during childbirth)\n\n- post-partum (via breast-feeding). 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth.\n\nTransmission can be influenced by several factors:\n\n- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load and low CD4 lymphocyte levels;\n\n- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery and intra-uterine infection (chorioamniotitis);\n\n- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries ;\n\n- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection.\n\n'''VZV'''\n\nTransmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes you to the risk of\n\n- ''Embryofetopathy'': the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation: amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy.\n\n- Shingles'' in the 1<sup>rst</sup> year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and > 3 weeks of childbirth)\n\n- '''Varicella neonatorum''': for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. '''93. [[Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) SD-093|Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal)]]'''''\n\n- In the case of maternal varicella, there is still a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

There are risks for the foetus and/or newborn baby if it has the corresponding antigen. This is the leading cause of foetal anaemia.\n\n\nThe patient may become immune during pregnancy as a result of foetomaternal haemorrhage (passage of \"incompatible\" foetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation).\n\n\nThe most frequent and serious alloimmunisations with foetal and neonatal consequences are anti-D (Rh1), c (Rh4) or Kell. Other blood group antigens may be involved much more rarely and with a lower risk (anti-E).\n\n\nThis situation can lead to foetal anaemia in cases of foetal-maternal blood incompatibility. If the foetus has the erythrocyte antigen corresponding to the maternal antibody, the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta may be responsible for haemolysis and therefore foetal anaemia.

Typical pain is in the mouth, on a tooth, and becomes increasingly severe, persistent and radiating, depending on the cause. A dental examination is necessary.\n\n- '''Dentin caries''': brief pain after stimulus to the tooth (cold, hot, sugar, acid).\n\n- Acute pulpitis: sharp, radiating, homolateral pain, provoked and then spontaneous.\n\n- Purulent pulpitis'': pulsating, violent, long-lasting pain radiating throughout the oral cavity.\n\n- ''Periodontitis'': stabbing, sometimes intense pain, aggravated by decubitus and heat, with a sensation of ''long tooth''; oedema and gingival inflammation opposite the causal tooth, very painful axial percussion of the tooth.\n\n- Dental abscess'': complication of previous conditions that have not been treated or have been poorly treated, sharp, stabbing, sleepless pain with general infectious signs and sometimes spectacular local signs (oedema, vestibular filling, reddening of the skin opposite the causal tooth, trismus, cervical adenopathy).\n\n- '''Alveolitis''': 2-3 days after a tooth extraction, violent pain radiating from the tooth.\n\n- ''Accidental evolution of the mandibular wisdom tooth'': locoregional pain, local inflammatory signs opposite 38 or 48, sometimes trismus.\n\n- Pain induced by orthodontic treatment: generally caused by slightly too rapid movement of the teeth, which ceases as soon as the movement is moderated. Sometimes due to mucosal injury caused by orthodontic equipment (careful examination required).\n\n\n'''<u>Algie of sinus origin</u>''''\n\nFacial pain opposite the affected sinus, increased by bending forward and pressure on the sinus. Causes: acute and chronic sinusitis (''item 148'').\n\n'''<u>Algies of non-dental oral origin</u>'''\n\nMost lesions of the oral mucosa are painful. Diagnosis is generally straightforward in the presence of oral pain, based on examination of the mucosal surface (tongue depressor, good lighting, palpation with gloves).\n\n- Traumatic ulceration'': localised sharp pain. Examination: lesion with regular borders, discreetly erythematous. Little or no induration. Removal of the causative agent leads to healing in a few days. Any lesion persisting for more than a fortnight should be biopsied.\n\n- Mouth ulcers: very common. Continuous pain, sometimes sleepless, exacerbated by eating certain foods. Examination: well-rounded ulceration, regular margins, flat fibrinous base, surrounded by a slightly red halo. Palpation: soft base. Sometimes severe pain and inability to eat orally due to large mouth ulcers in immunocompromised patients (hospitalisation for parenteral nutrition or SNG).\n\n- Cancers of the oral cavity: spontaneous pain which increases with chewing and limits eating. Examination: ulcerations with raised edges, indurated, bleeding on contact or painful, congestive inflammatory tumour. Biopsy essential.\n\n- '''Infections with ulceration of the mucous membranes'': single oral ulceration (tuberculosis) or multiple (oral herpes).\n\n- '''Lingual mycoses''': cooking pains (candidiasis).\n\n- '''Drug-induced toxicidermia''': erythema multiforme.\n\n- Radiotherapy-induced mucositis'': diffuse pain throughout the oral cavity, increased by the absence of saliva (makes eating difficult).\n\n- Any general pathology can lead to painful lesions in the oral mucosa.\n\n\n'''<u>Alges of salivary cause (item 90)</u>''''\n\n\n'''<u>Facial pain of bony causes</u>''''\n\n- Fractures of the facial bones: post-traumatic pain due to mobilisation of the fracture site (during palpation/pressure examination). Impotence of the mandible if fractured at this level.\n\n- Osteitis: throbbing, fluctuating, non-rhythmic pain\n\n- ''Post-radiation osteoradionecrosis or osteitis'': painful osteolysis, most often of dental origin, a few years after radiotherapy for a tumour of the face and neck.\n\n- Bone tumours: benign tumours are painless except in the event of inflammation or superinfection. Malignant tumours may become painful as a result of invasion of the trigeminal branches (symptomatic neuralgia with V2 or V3 dysaesthesia).\n\n\n<u>'''Facial pain of mandicatory causes:'''</u> temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain.\n\n- '''Acute TMJ pain:'''\n\no Acute arthritis: rare, with local inflammatory signs and limited mouth opening.\n\no Fractures: post-traumatic, painful limitation of mouth opening by local muscle contracture\n\no Dislocation\n\n- '''Chronic secondary TMJ pain:''' periarticular, laterofacial, preauricular and retro-orbital pain, with temporal and masseter myalgias radiating readily to the upper and lower molar sectors. Examination: temporomandibular pain on pressure of the external auditory canal and endobuccal palpation of the masticatory muscles. A pop and a snap when opening the mouth, which is usually bayonet-shaped. Most often due to an anomaly in the dental articulation.",

Figure below). These properties are altered in heart failure.\n**Ventricular loading conditions. Preload corresponds to ventricular filling conditions in diastole.

It results in a short-term increase in inotropy or cardiac ejection volume. In the long term, however, it is associated with an alteration in ventricular geometry and function. It involves several phenomena: neurohormonal activation, altered calcium and mitochondrial metabolism, interstitial fibrosis, hypertrophy and cell death.\n*Figure [[File:Diagram of the main determinants of ventricular remodelling in CI.png|vignette|482x482px|schematisation des principaux d\u00e9terminants du remodelage ventriculaire dans l'IC]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n====Desynchronisation and arrhythmia====\nBackground: IC is accompanied by frequent changes in cardiac electrical activation; it is rare for an IC patient to have a strictly normal ECG.\n\nDesynchronisation: electrical disorders of ventricular activation (first degree AVB, left bundle branch block) with haemodynamic consequences (shorter duration of diastole in the cardiac cycle, delayed contraction of the lateral wall on the septal wall in systole). This desynchronisation can be corrected by specific stimulation techniques such as resynchronisation.\n\nArrhythmias: all the changes encountered in heart failure (alteration of the ventricular substrate, neurohormonal activation, presence of electrical triggers) favour the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardias, fibrillation). These arrhythmias can be poorly tolerated and lead to sudden death. They can be prevented in cases of severe IC by installing a defibrillation system.\n\n===''Right heart failure'''===\nRight heart failure may be secondary to intrinsic damage to the right ventricle or to an increase in right ventricular afterload due to precapillary PH or postcapillary PH itself linked to left heart failure (the most frequent cause).

Patients without a precise diagnosis at the latest one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the state of the scientific, medical and technical art does not allow a precise diagnosis to be made. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse. When faced with unusual clinical signs (e.g. symptoms at an earlier age than usual), and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals should make it a reflex to suggest a rare disease.\n\nThe national organisation is highly structured and is based on the following elements (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/prises-en-charge-specialisees/maladies-rares/):\n\n- '''Centres de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence maladies rares''' (CRMR): A CRMR is a \"network\" comprising a coordinating site, one or more constituent sites and, where appropriate, one or more centres of competence (CCMR) or resource and competence centres.

Depending on the various prognostic/predictive factors and the type of surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy and/or treatment with trastuzumab (anti-HER2 antibody) and/or radiotherapy may be carried out in the (neo)adjuvant setting.\n\nIn the metastatic stages, treatment cannot be curative and is essentially based on systemic treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapies). The aim of these treatments is to increase patients' survival and improve their quality of life.\n\n==Treatment principles:==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Don't forget the associated measures:'''\n\n- Discussion of the therapeutic strategy at a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (RCP) to define the optimal treatment for the patient.\n\n- Announcement consultation, explanation of the personalised care plan (PPS).\n\n- Application for exemption from co-payment (ALD 30).\n\n- Comprehensive care, including psychological, social and dietary support.\n\n- Supportive care deals with the consequences of the disease and its treatment, and can include pain management, nutrition, fatigue, fertility/sexuality, adapted physical activity sessions, art therapy, socio-aesthetic advice, etc.\n|}\n\n===1/ Surgery===\nBreast treatment may be conservative or radical, depending on the size of the tumour, the number of sites, the volume of the breast and any associated lesions (carcinoma in situ +++).\n\nSurgery of the armpit is always associated with invasive carcinoma. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to drain the mammary gland: its anatomopathological analysis, when negative, makes it possible to dispense with the more morbid lymph node dissection; it involves double identification by injection of technetium and patent blue or by fluorescence using indocyanine green. If the lymph node is invaded preoperatively (positive puncture under ultrasound), axillary lymph node dissection is carried out immediately.\n\n===2/ Radiotherapy===\nBreast radiotherapy combines external radiotherapy of the whole breast and additional radiation in the operating bed (\"boost\"). It is used systematically after conservative surgery.\n\nParietal radiotherapy (after mastectomy) combined with additional dose in the operating bed is indicated in the presence of several poor prognostic factors.\n\nRadiotherapy of the lymph nodes is justified in the case of axillary lymph node involvement (supra-clavicular fossa +/- internal mammary chain).\n\n===3/ Systemic treatments===\nIn the localised stages of the disease, systemic treatments are either \"adjuvant\" (after surgery) or \"neoadjuvant\" (before surgery). The aim of (neo)adjuvant treatment is to destroy distant micro-metastases that are not detected by the extension work-up, thereby reducing the risk of relapse, particularly in the form of metastases.\n\nIn the metastatic stage, treatments are given throughout the course of the disease (except in the final palliative phase) and are adapted to the course of the disease and the patient's tolerance.\n\n*Chemotherapy: the 2 main families used are anthracyclines and taxanes. Adverse reactions are detailed in item 294.\n\n*Hormone therapy: either anti-oestrogen (tamoxifen) or anti-aromatase (letrozole, anastrozole, exemestane). The main hormonal effects are hot flushes, weight gain, arthralgia, thrombosis and increased risk of endometrial cancer (tamoxifen) and osteoporosis (anti-aromatase).\n\n*Targeted therapies: a large number of targeted therapies are used in oncology. The main class that has made it possible to change the natural history of breast cancer by increasing the cure rate of certain cancers is the anti-HER2 class. The leader is trastuzumab.\n\n===4/ Monitoring===\nIt includes :\n\n*Joint management by: surgeon, medical oncologist, radiotherapist, general practitioner, gynaecologist, etc.\n\n*a clinical breast examination at least twice a year for the first 5 years, then annually.\n\n*A mammogram and ultrasound are carried out every year for life.\n\n*Other examinations are carried out on request.\n\n===5/ Support care===\nThis is systematic and helps to maintain quality of life. In the case of bone metastases, it is essential to prescribe a bisphosphonate or denosumab to limit bone complications. Deconditioning during exercise is often identified and may be the subject of a medical prescription for adapted physical activity.",

Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment of the attack. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip or shoulder.\n\n\nThe diagnosis of gout is based on :\n\n- background: men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout);\n\n- certain nutritional deviations that highlight gene-environment interactions: excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even \"sugar-free\" soft drinks), consumption of beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine), strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.), high-calorie diets (excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks in general) and diets rich in animal proteins;\n\n- history (previous gout attacks, family history of gout, history of uric lithiasis); in a gouty attack, triggers should be sought: trauma, postoperative context, infarction or distant infection, medication (initiation of a hypouricemic agent), intake of certain drinks or foods triggering gouty attacks in a given gout sufferer;\n\n- the characteristics of a microcrystalline crisis ;\n\n- topography ;\n\n- their rapid sensitivity to colchicine (started early);\n\n- the presence of visible and/or clinically palpable tophus;\n\n\nReasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test\n\n- uricemia, which is most often found to be above 360 \u03bcmol/l (60 mg/l), but which may be normal during attacks (the measurement should be repeated a fortnight after the gouty attack, to obtain a \"basal\" uricemia before the start of hypouricemic treatment);\n\n- detection of UMS microcrystals in the joint fluid or in a clinical tophus: this is the most important diagnostic test as it is pathognomonic +++.\n\n- requesting an imaging test :\n\n- Joint radiography does not show the appearance of uratic arthropathy until very late, with epiphyseal geodes or notches, prolonged preservation of the joint space and marginal osteophytosis. It is particularly useful for differential diagnosis +++.\n\n- joint ultrasound, with colour Doppler, can be very useful if it shows a \"double contour\" appearance (corresponding to the uratic deposits present on the surface of the cartilage) or to detect gouty tophus not visible on clinical examination or X-ray. Doppler will show the more intense vascularisation associated with the vascular component of the local inflammatory reaction.\n\n\n'''Identify situations requiring specialist advice'''\n\n- Any early onset of gout before the age of 35 (on the advice of rheumatologists or specialist nephrologists: look for genetic or kidney diseases).\n\n- Polyarticular gout.\n\n- Tophaceous gout or gouty dactylitis.\n\n- Gout in chronic renal failure (GFR < 60 ml/min).\n\n- Gout in heart failure or unstable coronary artery disease.\n\n- Gout that is difficult to treat (ineffectiveness, intolerance or contraindications to the use of colchicine, NSAIDs and repeated use of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids).\n\n- History of allopurinol allergy before starting febuxostat.",

In this rare diseases item, briefly mention the rare diseases that may be encountered in the career of a general practitioner, in particular haemochromatosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The aim is not to cover all these diseases, but to understand how common they are, the huge diversity of clinical pathways and the need for multidisciplinary follow-up of patients.\n|Rubric=Etiologies\n|Contributors=Sylvie Odent\n|Order=3}}\n\n'''Haemochromatosis''': A genetic disease caused by excessive intestinal absorption of iron, most often linked to a deficiency in the production of hepcidin, the systemic iron-regulating hormone, and more rarely to hepcidino-resistance. As a result, iron is deposited in various organs such as the liver, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis can lead to chronic fatigue ('''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]]'''), melanoderma and liver damage ('''[[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]]''') (cirrhosis with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma), diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]'''), osteoporosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or heart failure. Biochemical abnormalities include elevated transferrin saturation coefficient (reflecting hyperabsorption of iron, and therefore very early onset) and elevated serum ferritin (reflecting visceral iron overload, and therefore secondary onset) (''[[Ferritin: decrease or increase SD-207|ferritin: decrease or increase]]'''). Haemochromatosis linked to the ''HFE'' gene, by far the most common form, is a frequent disease, with around 1 in 200 Caucasians carrying the genetic predisposition (homozygous ''HFE'' C282Y mutation). Its penetrance (probability of expressing the disease) is incomplete and its expressivity (nature of the symptoms presented) variable. Haemochromatosis is as common in men as in women, but is more marked in men. There are rare forms of haemochromatosis that are not linked to the HFE gene. These forms are not exclusive to Caucasian populations; they are often more severe and earlier-onset (they occur before the age of 30 and are sometimes called juvenile haemochromatosis) ([[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|'''Announcement of a chronic disease'']]). Haemochromatosis, which may or may not be linked to the HFE gene, is autosomal recessive, except in the exceptional case of hepcidino-resistance (dominant disease).\n\n'''Haemophilia''' : X-linked genetic disease characterised by spontaneous or prolonged haemorrhage due to a deficiency in factor VIII (haemophilia A, gene ''F8'') or IX (haemophilia B, gene ''F9'') ('''[[Bleeding tendency SD-059|bleeding tendency]], [[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]]'''). The annual incidence is 1 in 5000 male births and the prevalence in the population is estimated at 1/12,000. Haemorrhage usually starts when the child learns to walk. The severity of clinical manifestations depends on the severity of the coagulation factor deficiency: if the biological activity of the coagulation factor is less than 1%, haemophilia is severe. If it is between 1 and 5%, haemophilia is moderate. If it is between 5 and 40%, the haemophilia is minor. Bleeding can occur at any site following trauma, most often in the joints (haemarthrosis) (''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]''') and muscles (''[[Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma]]'''). To compensate for factor VIII or IX deficiency, a replacement therapy is used, the aim of which is to supply the missing factor to the body: recombinant antihaemophilic factor. It can be administered following a haemorrhage (treatment on demand) or to prevent bleeding (prophylactic treatment). Haemophilia A and B are haemorrhagic diseases, the management of which is the responsibility of the patient's therapeutic education. The most frequent complication is the appearance of antibodies directed against the infused coagulation factor, inhibiting its action (known as inhibitory antibodies). Surgical corrections, particularly orthopaedic, are possible in specialised centres (''[[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]]''').\n\nSickle cell anaemia: A frequent autosomal recessive genetic disease (around 270 new cases per year in the Ile-de-France region, 400 new cases per year in France), which is serious and mainly affects people of sub-Saharan African and West Indian origin. The prevalence of heterozygotes in Europe is estimated at around 1/150: in Central and West Africa (15-25%), in the American overseas departments (10-12%) and in the Mediterranean regions (1-15%), a high prevalence is observed in areas that are or have been affected by malaria, as this anomaly offers protection against neuromalaria. Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormality in the haemoglobin (\"HBB\" gene) which results in the deformation of red blood cells, causing them to lose their rounded shape (false shape). Sickle cell anaemia is a chronic haemolytic disease predisposing to 3 types of acute complications: severe anaemia (''[[Childhood pallor SD-055|childhood pallor]], [[Decreased haemoglobin SD-217|decreased haemoglobin]]''), severe bacterial infections and ischaemic vaso-occlusive accidents (AVO) secondary to conflicts between the small vessels and the red blood cells which are not sufficiently deformable. Various organic complications may also arise. Management must include the prevention of infections, pain ('''[[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]], [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SDD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]], [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]]'') and any complications, as well as the social and psycho-educational dimension, within multidisciplinary centres equipped with intensive care (immediate access to blood transfusion) ('''[[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]]'''). Occasional or scheduled transfusion remains an essential therapeutic modality ('''[[Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion]]'')''. The main indication for bone marrow transplantation is the presence of cerebral vasculopathy. Some children with severe sickle cell disease may require intensified treatment: hydroxycarbamide, transfusion programme, haematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene therapy. Systematic neonatal screening SD-308|neonatal screening]'' is offered to at-risk populations.\n\n'''Thalassaemias''': Genetic disorders, most often autosomal recessive, which result in a reduction in the synthesis of globin chains, either alpha (alpha-thalassaemias, ''HBA1'' and ''HBA2'' genes) or beta (beta-thalassaemias, ''HBB'' gene). The imbalance in synthesis between alpha and non-alpha chains causes precipitation of unpaired chains, inefficient erythropoiesis and anaemia ('''[[Child pallor SD-055|child pallor]], [[Haemoglobin decrease SD-217|haemoglobin decrease]]'''). Depending on the degree of anaemia and transfusion requirements, a distinction is made between intermediate thalassaemias with moderate transfusion requirements and major thalassaemias for which regular transfusions are vital (''[[Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion]])''. The prognosis for these forms has been improved by transfusion programmes and iron chelation; given the complexity of the treatment, children are offered a bone marrow transplant with an HLA-compatible related donor (''[[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|announcement of a chronic disease]]'').\n\n'''Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)''': X-linked disease characterised by progressive atrophy and ''[[Muscular weakness SD-074|muscular weakness]]''' due to degeneration of the skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles. DMD mainly affects boys, and the prevalence of male births is between 1/3,500 and 1/9,300. Muscle damage is caused by the complete absence of dystrophin, due to variants in the \"DMD\" gene. The disease begins in early childhood, and affected boys may present with neurodevelopmental disorders (after the age of 18 months), language disorders and/or a delay in overall development (''[[Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly SD-115|Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly]]''). Autism and behavioural problems are relatively common. The disease progresses rapidly and the child develops a \"waddling\" gait and has a positive Gowers sign. Loss of walking occurs between the ages of 6 and 13, with an average of 9.5 years in patients not treated with steroids. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, family history and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels 100 to 200 times higher than normal. Genetic analysis is the reference method. Although the situation is improving thanks to advances in multidisciplinary management and treatment, the prognosis for DMD is severe and life expectancy is significantly reduced, with death occurring early in adulthood (''[[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|announcement of a chronic disease]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]'').",

Severe and painful PFP with hearing impairment.\n\n- ENT pathology (mastoiditis, parotitis, parotid tumour): evocative auricular discharge or painful enlargement of the parotid gland ([[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]]).\n\n- Lyme meningo-radiculitis: tick bite in the preceding days or weeks or erythematous plaque. PFP may reveal the infection.\n\n- other bacterial or viral meningoradiculitis (coxsackie, herpes, mumps).\n\n- HIV infection, particularly during seroconversion.\n\n* Brain stem stroke: PFP associated with contralateral hemiplegia of the face (alternating syndrome).\n\n* Multiple sclerosis: importance of a history of previous relapses.\n\n* Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome: PFP in the background of a picture dominated by limb involvement. Facial diplegia may occur.\n\n* General inflammatory diseases:\n\n- Sarcoidosis: PFP may inaugurate the disease (most frequent cranial involvement).\n\n- Melkerson-Rosenthal syndrome: recurrent PFP, with mucocutaneous infiltration of the face, plicated tongue and family history.\n\n* Tumours: progressive onset, usually affecting other cranial nerves (cerebellopontine angle tumour, trunk glioma, skull base metastasis, carcinomatous meningoradiculitis).

Because it passes freely through cell membranes, it increases osmolality without causing water movement).\n\n*At steady state, osmolality is identical between the extracellular and intracellular compartments and is equal to approximately 285 mOsm/Kg H2O.\n*'''Estimation of urinary osmolality:''''  Uosm = [Na+ + K+ ] x 2 + urea (mmol/L)\n\n*A disorder of intracellular hydration is the consequence of a non-zero water balance (positive in intracellular hyperhydration [ICH] and negative in intracellular dehydration [IDH]), and is necessarily accompanied by a change in osmolality (hypoosmolality in ICH and hyperosmolality in ICD) and therefore in natraemia, which is the main determinant of osmolality (hyponatremia in ICH and hypernatremia in ICD). It may be isolated or accompanied by a disorder of extracellular hydration.\n*The kidney's capacity to excrete free water is important. It depends on the capacity to suppress hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of ADH and the maximum dilution capacity of the kidney. Under normal conditions, the kidney is capable of lowering urinary osmolality to a minimum of 60 mOsm/Kg of H20. Pure water cannot be eliminated on its own, so a minimum supply of osmoles in the urine is required (in practice 60 mOsm/Kg). This can lead to a positive water balance and hypo-osmolality (''and therefore hyponatremia''):\n**when the maximum physiological water excretion capacity is exceeded, for example in the case of potomania.\n***For a standard osmolar intake of 600 mOsm/day, a positive water balance (dilution hyponatremia due to the inability to eliminate all the water drunk) occurs for a water intake of more than 10 litres (potomania). To eliminate 1 litre of water with a urinary osmolality of 60 mOsm/kg, 60 mOsm are required. To eliminate 10 litres, 600 mOsm are required.\n***For an osmolar intake of 120 mOsm/day (low intake, situation observed in the case of diets low in animal proteins and salt, anorexia nervosa), a positive water balance appears for a water intake of more than 2 litres (tea and toast syndrome).\n**When water excretion is reduced by altering the maximum diluting power of urine. There are 2 main situations:\n***Low ADH associated with a primary renal defect in water excretion as in advanced chronic renal failure (GFR \u2264 20 mL/min),\n***high ADH:\n****Par '''appropriate secretion of ADH in hypovolaemic situations:'''\n*****to true hypovolaemia (all causes of extracellular dehydration),\n*****with \"effective\" hypovolaemia (associated with extracellular hyperhydration):\n******congestive heart failure,\n******cirrhosis,\n******nephrotic syndrome,\n****Par ''inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH)'': inappropriate because the blood volume is normal and there is no braking associated with the drop in osmolality.",

In the school, a personalised schooling project (PPS) or an individualised reception project can be proposed, and an AESH can help a child with a disability.

The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.\n*The quantity of H<sup>+</sup> entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> \u21d4 H2CO3 \u21d4 CO2 + H2O\n*This buffer system is said to be \"open\" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.\n*Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH<sub>blood</sub> = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/[H2CO3]) = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/0.03 PC02)\n*The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO2 and HCO3<sup>-</sup> is modified, i.e. :\n**when there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO3<sup>-</sup> ions. This is known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis,\n**or when there is a primary change in PCO2. This is known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.\n\nB.    The main sources of acid\n\n*There are two main sources of acid:\n**Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O2, water and CO2 (oxidative metabolism). The CO2 generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO2 leads to respiratory acidosis.\n**Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H2SO4 for sulphur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H2P04 for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.\n\nC.    Role of the lung in acid-base balance\n\n*By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO2 of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO2 through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO2 by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.\n*Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO2 and pCO2, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.\n\nD.    Role of the kidney in acid-base balance\n\n*Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.\n*Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",

Thirst regulates input and the kidney ensures balance by regulating output to keep both intra- and extra-cellular osmolality constant.\n*Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. It is transported to the posterior pituitary gland for secretion. ADH secretion is regulated by variations in plasma osmolality (around 1%) and plasma volume (between 10 and 15%).\n*ADH acts on the main cells of the collecting duct by binding to its specific V2 receptors at their basal pole. This binding leads to the expression of water channels, type 2 aquaporins, on the apical membrane. ADH thus enables the permeability of the collecting duct to water, and therefore the final urinary osmolality, to be varied finely. The second necessary condition for water reabsorption is the existence of an osmolar concentration gradient between the tubular fluid and the interstitium, a condition which is physiologically achieved by the creation of a corticopapillary gradient.\n*When ADH is not secreted or is ineffective, the sensation of thirst prevents a negative water balance. This is very important in clinical situations, as intracellular dehydration only occurs when thirst is ineffective (coma, psychiatric disorders, sedation in intensive care, elderly or overly young patients).\n*A negative water balance and hyperosmolality (hypernatremia) may therefore be observed in cases of :\n**cutaneous or respiratory extrarenal water loss;\n**abnormalities in the thirst centres (adipsia) or hypothalamic osmoreceptors.\n**renal water loss due to lack of ADH secretion or lack of renal sensitivity to ADH responsible for diabetes insipidus resulting in a polyuro-polydipsic syndrome.\n*Intracellular dehydration without hypernatremia:\n**Plasma hyperosmolality is secondary to the abnormal presence of a solute other than sodium, of low molecular weight and osmotically active. This solute is responsible for an \"osmotic gap\" defined as the difference between measured and calculated osmolality. This solute may be mannitol, ethylene glycol, etc.\n**When the solute diffuses freely into the cells (urea, ethanol), it is said to be osmotically inactive and will not cause any disturbance to intracellular hydration.\n\n<br />",

The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.\n\n=== '''Epidemiology''' ===\nThe main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex and a family history of AAA.\n\nAAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs).\n\nThe prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.\n\n=== '''Natural history''' ===\nThe diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be \"fast-growing\" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year.\n\nThe risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm.\n\nFor the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.\n\n=== '''Other aneurysmal locations''' ===\n\n==== Popliteal artery aneurysms ====\nAAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, but most often in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases).\n\nA popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived) or during ultrasound exploration (for example during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia or, more rarely, stress ischaemia.\n\nThe main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high.\n\nRarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis.\n\nRupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.\n\n==== Aneurysms of the iliac or femoral arteries ====\nMore rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.\n\n==== Thoracic aortic aneurysms ====\nAAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",

This condition is uncommon. It is indicative of advanced and diffuse atheromatous disease.\n\n*Functional signs: This is a triad associating :\n**Post prandial abdominal pain ('''''SD-004: abdominal pain'''''): This corresponds to claudication of the small intestine (mesenteric angina). It is the earliest and most constant symptom, and consists of intense cramp-like pain. It most often occurs in the periumbilical region. It begins around 15 to 30 minutes after ingestion and slowly subsides over one to two hours. Its severity and duration are correlated with the quantity, calorie and fat content of the meal and the degree of malperfusion. In the early stages, only large meals trigger the pain, then as the lesions progress, the pain becomes more frequent after ingestion of a modest volume of food;\n**Eviction and food splitting: these post-prandial pains lead patients to reduce their food intake for fear of post-prandial pain.  Severe malnutrition may set in;\n**Emaciation: this is often significant and results from malnutrition.\n\nOther symptoms may be associated but are less typical: diarrhoea, vomiting.\n\n*Physical signs:\n**An abdominal murmur is inconstantly present. Clinical examination may reveal the presence of other atheromatous sites (carotid or femoral murmurs, abolition of peripheral pulses).\n\n'''Acute intestinal ischaemia'''\n\nIt is defined as the acute interruption of digestive vascularisation, in relation to acute arterial occlusion by embolism, thrombosis or dissection. It is an absolute and vital therapeutic emergency.\n\nEarly diagnosis is essential at the stage of reversible intestinal ischaemia. Acute abdominal pain occurring in a patient at risk (>60 years old, atheromatous, emboligic heart disease) should systematically raise this diagnosis, given its seriousness.\n\nThe spontaneous prognosis is extremely poor in the absence of treatment, rapidly leading to death. If blood flow is restored, the prognosis remains poor and depends on the extent of intestinal necrosis.\n\n*Functional signs\n**Abdominal pain is the most constant sign. It is a sudden and intense cramp-like pain, located in the umbilical region and in the right iliac fossa. The intensity of the pain contrasts with a poor physical examination and an initially stable general condition. In the early stages, there is often hyperperistalsis, which may manifest as diarrhoea.\n\nWithin a few hours, an intestinal obstruction develops (vomiting, defensiveness). General signs are present, with fever, progressive shock and multiple organ failure. These signs indicate the existence of an irreversible infarct.\n\n*Physical signs: A distinction can be made between :\n**A reversible acute mesenteric ischaemic syndrome characterised by very severe pain and the absence of peritoneal signs;\n**A picture of intestinal mesenteric infarction, characterised by severe permanent pain with peritoneal signs (abdominal contracture), an occlusive state and then a state of shock.",

The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether or not the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated: stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium (loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule). PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol (an active metabolite of vitamin D) increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.\n*Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone.\n*Hypocalcaemia therefore results :\n**either an increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation),\n**or a reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption).",

Stems from the work of Ivan Pavlov on conditioning, and Aaron Beck on cognitivism. Postulates that patients' symptoms stem from inappropriate learned behaviour, dysfunctional cognition and/or difficulties in emotional regulation. CBT then proposes to identify these behaviours, thoughts and emotions and to find alternative adaptive strategies.\n\n- Psychoanalytic psychotherapy: includes both analytically inspired psychotherapy and traditional psychoanalysis. Stems from the work of Sigmund Freud. Postulates that patients' problems are based on unresolved unconscious conflicts from childhood.\n\n- Family/systemic therapies: consider the family or couple as a dynamic system whose members are in continuous interaction. The patient's symptoms (\"designated patient\", \"symptom carrier\") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs to be rebalanced by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.\n\n- Therapeutic education: therapeutic patient education \"aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease.  It includes organised activities designed to make patients aware of and informed about their illness and care\" (HAS).\n\n- Cognitive remediation: an approach based on neurology, neuropsychology and rehabilitation, enabling patients to improve their cognitive functioning and thus their quality of life.",

[[Frequency measurement, Prevalence, Incidence (rate of), Risk 2C-020-DE-A07]]), possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population, or in other populations, or between several periods, possibly standardising on the distribution of sex, age (cf. [[Adjusted frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13|Standardised frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13]])\n* <u>Analytical</u>: to study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied by comparing frequency indicators of the health phenomenon between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects by tests and measures of association (cf. [Raw or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), number needed to treat (NNT) and crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]] and [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]. ).\n\nMethods of '''recruitment''' of the subjects making up the sample at the initial time :\n\n* <u>Cohort study with a cross-sectional starting point</u>: initial sample formed from the selection (preferably exhaustive) or random drawing of subjects presenting consecutively at one or more recruitment centres (source population, cf. [[Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05]]). This sampling aims to have the best possible representativeness of the target population.\n<u>Exposed/unexposed cohort studies</u>: a particular form of cohort in which exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.\n\n'''Follow-up''' after inclusion: what characterises a cohort is this follow-up of subjects (= <u>longitudinal study</u>) since their inclusion for a period generally determined for the study in order to collect data after inclusion:\n\n* the possible occurrence of the event studied (absent at inclusion) when the endpoint is qualitative with its date of occurrence, or changes in the level of the endpoint if it is quantitative (for which the baseline level is available at inclusion)\n* the date of early exit from the study due to death (if not part of the endpoint itself), relocation or lack of news (lost to follow-up).\n\nRetrospective, prospective or mixed character:\n\n* <u>Prospective cohort</u>: the start of inclusions is after the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n* <u>Retrospective cohort (= historical)</u>: the start of inclusions is prior to the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n** The initial sample is reconstituted ''a posteriori'' as it might have been constituted in the past by selecting a group of subjects at an initial time in the past. This is only possible when we have a file of identifiable subjects for such a study (for example, a file of company employees with occupational health data) whose status with regard to the health phenomenon studied at inclusion can be determined, even for subjects who can no longer be contacted at the time the study is designed.\n** The follow-up history of these subjects between inclusion and the point date is therefore reconstructed retrospectively. This is therefore only possible if individual follow-up of subjects from inclusion to the point date is available.\n* <u>Mixed cohort</u>: combination of the two previous modes of inclusion (inclusion and follow-up partly retrospective then continuing after protocol finalisation prospective manner).\n\n== Case-control study\nInvolves the separate selection of two groups of subjects:\n\n* a group of subjects suffering from the event under study (''cases'')\n* a group of subjects not affected by the event under study (''controls'')\n\n'''Advantage''': being able to over-represent in the sample people carrying a phenomenon to be studied <u>rare</u> in the population (often a disease). In this case, it can be interesting to include several controls per case because the statistical power increases, but in general this gain is minimal compared with the logistical complexity beyond 5 controls per case.\n\nMeets exclusively '''analytical objectives''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls by calculating the <u>odds-ratio</u>, which is the only measure of association that can generally be estimated in this type of survey (cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]).\n\nRecruitment of cases:\n\n* <u>Case-incident</u> (= the subject is included at the time he or she becomes a case): recruitment of cases on the occasion of diagnosis or the occurrence of the event.\n* <u>Prevalent-case</u> (= when included the subject has already been a case for some time): recruitment of cases regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made (recruitment more often the source of selection bias - selective survival bias, cf. [[Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias 2C-020-DE-A12]] - but generally allows faster recruitment than case-incident recruitment because it is possible to \"draw on\" the active files of patients who have already been diagnosed).\n\nProcedures for '''recruiting controls''' must be thought through very carefully because, ideally, controls should come from the same population as cases: i.e. <u>any controls eligible and identifiable for the study could have been recruited as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon under study.</u> It is often done in parallel with the recruitment of cases, with possibly <u>matching</u> or <u>stratification.</u>\n\n'''Collection of exposures''' always <u>retrospective</u> in a case-control study for these two groups of subjects: the period covered by the collection of information on exposure is therefore always prior to the start of the survey.\n\n== Cross-sectional survey ==\nMainly used to'''' estimate the level of qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances, etc.)''' in a targeted population.\n\nCan meet a number of objectives:\n\n* '''Mainly descriptive''': estimating the level of indicators in a target population with a quantifiable margin of error (confidence interval) due to sampling fluctuations. In particular, this is the only study that makes it possible to estimate <u>prevalences</u> of a binary health phenomenon at the time of the study in a target population (provided that the sample recruited is representative of the population targeted in theory by the objectives)\n* '''Sometimes analytical''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the studied phenomenon collected at the time of the study, by estimating measures of association (relative risk, odds ratio, cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]). But the interpretation of these associations is all the more limited because the <u>chronological relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied</u> is not always easy to establish, and because previously exposed subjects who have developed a rapidly fatal form of the disease will not be included in the study (selective survival bias, see [[More advanced knowledge on biases 2C-020-DE-B14]]).\n\nRecruitment procedures: guided by the need to be as representative as possible of the population targeted by the study. Selection must be independent, i.e. it must not take into account the subjects' health status or the level of exposure, which we may be seeking to study if they constitute risk factors for the phenomenon under study. Random selection or consecutive inclusion of subjects within a source population are the methods of choice for these studies.\n\n'''Information collected''': status of each subject included with regard to the phenomenon studied and possibly exposure factors at the time of inclusion, regardless of the age of the events collected. It is not uncommon to collect in addition the <u>background and history</u> on the phenomenon studied and the exposure factors of the subjects relating to the period prior to inclusion, possibly since their birth. In contrast, <u>no data on events occurring after the subject's inclusion in the study are collected in a cross-sectional survey</u>.",

It therefore threatens the representativeness and external validity of the study.\n* <u>Bias of classification</u>: linked to the measurement of exposure and/or the judgement criterion.

Memory bias is an example of information bias linked to the unreliability of self-reported data.\n* <u>Confusion bias</u>: related to the fact that the observed relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied may be distorted by not taking into account a third factor (confounding factor) itself associated with both the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied.\n\n'''Selection and information biases relate to <u>descriptive and analytical objectives</u>.'''\n\n* They may lead to an over- or under-estimation of measures of frequency and measures of association.\n* They result from errors (avoidable or not) committed by the investigators (diagnostic errors, wrong choice of control group, refusal of participation of eligible subjects, lost to follow-up in a cohort...). <u>They must be identified and controlled at the time of protocol preparation, and cannot be corrected at the time of analysis</u>.\n\n'''Confounding biases relate only to <u>analytic objectives</u>.'''\n\n* They may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the measures of association.\n* They do not arise from errors made by the investigators, but reflect the nature of things.

This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e. it tends to bias the results of the study in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference.\n* or ''differential'', i.e. the risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference, or in favour of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.  \n\n'''Selection bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomisation prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimise these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.  \n\n'''Classification bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the classification error on the judgement criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgement criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words bring the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgement criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgement criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls.

This scheme is used in particular when the study requires additional data to be collected. In order to avoid collecting data on the entire initial cohort, only cases (from the entire cohort) and \"non-cases\" (from the sub-cohort) are collected.

To estimate the frequency of the event of interest in this population, we can use census data, for example, which will give us the total size of the population over the period for the denominator. These frequencies can be compared between several populations or over time. When different recording systems are available to estimate the frequency of the event of interest and that of exposure factors in groups of subjects, it is also possible to compare the joint changes in these frequencies over time or space. Example: estimate changes in the age- and sex-standardised cancer incidence rate in France between 1990 and 2020 using cancer registries, compare these incidence rates between different regions, study the correlation between changes in these incidence rates and changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption over the same period.",

They therefore reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ''survival time''. They are also called \"censored variables\" because of their incomplete nature:\n\n* If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).\n* When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ''censoring'': the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ''lost to view'' before the end of the study (e.g. following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.\n\nMethodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to take account of this censoring of survival time.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not knowing the event before t) and can therefore be represented graphically in the form of a ''survival curve'' as in the figure below.\n[[File:FigureSurvival.jpg|thumbnail|Example of survival curve]]\nA survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase). The vertical lines represent censures, i.e. the last visit of individuals lost to follow-up. The ''median survival'', which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample. In this example, it is 6 months.\n\nThe log-rank test is used to compare (univariate) the survival curves of two (or more) samples.\nThe hazard ratio is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of the event occurring over time.

[[Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias 2C-020-DE-A12]]). The result of a test is said to be significant if the value of p (= ''degree of significance'', ''p-value'' in English) is less than a threshold determined ''a priori'' (risk of first kind alpha) generally 0.05.\n\nIn a statistical test which seeks to demonstrate a difference, the alpha risk is the risk, fixed \"a priori\", of concluding falsely that there is a difference (see [[Statistical tests: principles of hypothesis testing 2C-020-DE-B09]]). The p-value is calculated \"a posteriori\" from the observed data and is the probability of observing a difference that is at least as large if in reality this difference does not exist. The conclusion of the test is based on the comparison of the value of p with the alpha risk (accepted \"a priori\").  If p is greater than alpha, then nothing can be concluded: the probability of observing a difference that is at least as large if in reality this difference does not exist is too great compared with the a priori accepted risk of wrongly concluding that there is a difference.\n\nBecause of sampling fluctuations, the estimation of a parameter (e.g. a difference in mean, an RR, an OR, an HR, etc.) must always be accompanied by a ''confidence interval''. This is an interval of possible values of the true value of the parameter in the population. Generally, we present the 95% confidence interval (CI<sub>95%</sub>) of a parameter, i.e. the level of confidence associated with the fact that the true parameter of interest belongs to this interval is 95%. In other words, if 100 samples are drawn at random from the same population, the estimate of the parameter will fall within this interval of values for 95 of the 100 samples.",

The studies enable a sample of these variables to be observed. Statistical tests are used to conclude whether the observed result can (null hypothesis), or cannot (alternative hypothesis), be explained by chance (due to sampling fluctuations) by determining a priori a threshold for the risk of making a mistake in concluding that the result is not due to chance (alpha risk of 1<sup> species</sup>, often set at 5%).\n\nThe interest of a study is not its raw results but its \"inference\" (extrapolation of the results observed on a sample to the population from which it is drawn). The risk of being wrong (due to sampling fluctuations) can be quantified by statistical tests and the estimation of confidence intervals.\n\nIn science, the \"hypothetico-deductive approach\" consists of formulating hypotheses and then testing their validity by conducting experiments and collecting data.\n\n'''Null hypotheses and alternatives:'''\n\nIn statistics, a hypothesis test is a procedure for deciding between two hypotheses:\n\n*''The null hypothesis'', noted H0: This is the hypothesis which we seek to reject, but which we want to have ''little chance'' of rejecting if it is true. For example: the effect of treatment A is the same as the effect of treatment B''. The ''first order risk'', noted \"alpha\", is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (P(reject H0 | H0 true)). By convention, we often set the first-species risk at 5%.\n*'''The alternative hypothesis''', noted H1: This is the complementary hypothesis to the null hypothesis, which we seek to accept. ''Continuation of the example: the effect of treatment A is different from the effect of treatment B''. '''The second-order risk''', noted \"beta\", is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (P(rejection H0 | H1 true)). The ''power'' of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis is true (1-beta).\n\n'''Power of a statistical test'''\n\nA statistical test is designed to be as powerful as possible for a fixed first-species risk (often 5%). The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Parameter'''\n|'''Influence on power''''\n|-\n|Size of sample analysed N\n|If N increases, power increases\n|-\n|Difference to be detected d\n|If d increases, power increases\n|-\n|Variability of observations (variance)\n|If variance increases, power decreases\n|-\n|Alpha risk\n|If alpha increases, power increases\n|-\n|One-tailed or two-tailed test\n|If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.\n|}\nIn practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).\n\n'''Stages of a statistical test:'''\n\nA statistical test is always based on the following steps:\n\n*Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis\n*Set the risk of error of the first kind.\n*Reduce what should often be observed if the null hypothesis were true, and thus determine a rejection zone for the null hypothesis.\n*Verify whether or not what is observed in the study is consistent with what would be expected under the null hypothesis.\n*If what is observed is consistent, the result of the test is the non-rejection of the null hypothesis (which does not mean that the null hypothesis is true, because the beta risk is never zero). If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is no significant difference.\n*If what is observed is not consistent, the result of the test is the rejection of the null hypothesis. There is always a risk of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (the alpha risk), but in this case we are allowed to conclude in favour of the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is a significant difference.\n*Calculate the significance level (see item 20_29).\n\n'''Single or bilateral test:''''\n\nWhen the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, the alternative hypothesis can be constructed in two ways:\n\n*bilaterally: the alternative hypothesis then corresponds to a difference, whatever its meaning. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B OR the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A''.\n*unilaterally: the alternative hypothesis corresponds to a difference in a single direction. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B. It cannot be concluded that the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A.''A difference that is not significant bilaterally may be significant unilaterally.\n\n'''Independence or matching of observations:'''\n\nIn a study, totally independent or paired measurements can be collected:\n\n*When each measurement is obtained in different and independent individuals, all measurements are totally independent. For example: ''blood glucose measurement 7 days after inclusion in the study \u21d2 measurements all independent.''\n*When certain measurements are obtained from the same individual, or from different but matched individuals (for example in a case-control study), these measurements are said to be matched. For example: ''blood glucose measurement at inclusion then 7 days after inclusion in the study \u21d2 two paired measurements in the same individual.''\n\nStatistical tests for independent data or paired data are not the same (but are based on the same steps as those described above).\n\n'''Parametric and non-parametric tests:''''\n\nEach statistical test has its own conditions of application. Certain conditions of application are based on the probability law of the underlying random variables being analysed.\n\nA parametric test is based on a certain hypothesis concerning the probability distribution. For example, a Student's t test is based on the assumption that the random variable being analysed follows a normal distribution.\n\nA non-parametric test makes no assumptions about the probability distribution.\n\n'''Choice of statistical test:''''\n\nThe choice of statistical test depends on :\n\n*the type of ''endpoint'' (called the variable to be explained or the dependent variable)\n*the type of ''exposure factor'' (called the independent or explanatory variable)\n*The structure of the data studied: ''independent'' or ''matched''.\n*The ''sample size'' (\u2265 30 or < 30) and the statistical ''distribution'' of the variables (normal or not) when they are quantitative:\n**A parametric test is only feasible if certain conditions are met (sample size \u2265 30, normal distribution of the variable, etc.).\n**If this is not the case, a non-parametric test must be performed.\n\nTable.

The associated drug treatment consists of preventing the complications of atherosclerosis: prescription of a statin (''[[Prescription and monitoring of a lipid-lowering agent]]''), antiplatelet treatment (''[[Anti-platelet agents|Prescription and monitoring of an antiaggregant treatment]]'') and an ACE inhibitor/ARB2 for the control of [[Hypertension in adults and children|hypertension]].\n\n===''Monitoring of AAA'''===\nThe monitoring schedule for asymptomatic AAA depends on its maximum diameter and the value at which the indication for surgery is discussed:\n\n- Maximum diameter less than 40 mm: surveillance ultrasound every year\n\n- Maximum diameter between 40 and 49 mm: surveillance ultrasound every 6 months\n\nFrom 50 mm, the indication for surgery is discussed.\n\n===''Surgical management'''===\nThe aim of surgical treatment of AAA is to prevent it from rupturing.\n\n- In men, it is discussed from a maximum diameter of 50 mm.\n\n- In women, it may be discussed for a diameter of less than 50 mm, as the risk of rupture is higher in women of the same diameter.\n\n- In men and women, it is indicated in cases of rapid growth (more than 1 cm in one year), or in cases of complicated aneurysms.\n\nThe pre-operative assessment includes an overall cardiovascular evaluation and an assessment of renal and respiratory function.\n\nTwo surgical techniques are currently used: conventional surgery and endovascular surgery.\n[[File:AAA Surgery.jpg|vignette]]\n- Conventional surgical treatment consists of flattening the graft. After laparotomy or lumbotomy, aortic clamping, opening of the AAA shell and removal of the thrombus, a prosthetic tube is sutured to the healthy aorta above and below the aneurysm to reconstruct the aorta.\n[[File:Aorta Endoprosthesis.jpg|vignette]]\n- Endovascular surgical treatment is less invasive. It involves intra-arterial femoral insertion of a suitable stent graft which is deployed in the aneurysm. A seal is achieved proximally, on a segment of healthy aorta above the AAA and below the renal arteries (collar), and distally, in the iliac arteries. Exclusion of the aneurysm by stent grafting requires specific anatomical conditions, which limit the indications. Endovascular treatment is preferred in patients at high risk of surgery. If the anatomy is favourable, it may be offered to low-risk patients.\n\n==='''Follow-up after AAA exclusion'''===\nFollow-up after surgery depends on the type of operation:\n\n*the [[Monitoring of valve and vascular prosthesis wearers|prostheses]] used in conventional surgery may be complicated by anastomotic aneurysms requiring annual monitoring by Doppler ultrasound;\n*the [[Monitoring of wearers of vascular valves and prostheses|endoprostheses]] require long-term monitoring by ultrasound-Doppler or angio-CT to detect the presence of endoleaks, migration or limb folds which may be complicated by occlusion.\n\nThe survival rate of patients, even after surgery, is lower than that of the general population. This excess mortality is explained by advanced age, cardiovascular risk factors, associated atherosclerosis, COPD and other post-smoking pathologies.\n\nMedical monitoring of the patient undergoing surgery must detect the secondary occurrence or evolution of other localisations of aneurysmal disease or atheromatous disease.\n\nThis medical management is based on the control of risk factors and the prevention of cardiovascular risk by medication (statin, antiplatelet, ACE inhibitor / ARB2).",

('''''[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]; [[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]''''').\n*There are 3 digestive arteries: the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery. The three territories are linked by anastomotic circulation. The superior mesenteric artery is the main artery of the digestive tract.\n\n*Chronic intestinal ischaemia. Digestive blood flow depends on the metabolic needs of the digestive tract and represents between 20 and 35% of the body's total oxygen consumption. When metabolic demand increases in the post-prandial period, splanchnic blood flow is increased. Hyperaemia is maximal in the hour following the arrival of ingested food. It lasts around 5 hours. In the event of arterial obstruction, the relative post-prandial hypoperfusion explains the ischaemia responsible for the pain. The intensity and duration of symptoms are proportional to the volume and composition of the food ingested and the degree of hypoperfusion. ('''''[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]; [[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]''''').\n\n*[[Fichier:Infarctus mesenterique.jpg|vignette]]Acute intestinal ischaemia: in the event of acute arterial occlusion or low flow, intestinal ischaemia occurs.

The most important stage in the disease is therapeutic education. The first step is to make the diagnosis, because putting a name to the symptoms is the first step in justifying and organising treatment. The fact that clinical and paraclinical tests are normal is often not enough to reassure the patient. The benign nature of the disease needs to be explained, along with the chronicity of the symptoms. Time must be taken to explain the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (alteration of the intestine-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motor disorders and intestinal dysbiosis) and the various treatment options. The aim of this approach is to avoid medical nomadism. The doctor-patient relationship is fundamental. To achieve this, the doctor must listen to the patient's expectations and questions, and avoid inaccurate and vexatious statements such as \"There's nothing wrong with you\" or \"It's all in your head\".\n\n           When a doctor prescribes treatment, it is important to set reasonable targets for the patient. The efficacy of treatments is often uncertain and does not lead to a cure. The aim is to improve symptoms in order to improve quality of life. It is important to plan the assessment of treatment efficacy so as not to miss any warning signs that may warrant a colonoscopy.\n\n           Medicinal treatments (table 1) are based on the prescription of antispasmodics and transit regulators in the first instance. In the second line, treatments such as certain diets, probiotics or hypnosis may also be used. Psychological treatment, or even antidepressants, may also be used. It should be explained that the target is not a mood disorder, but digestive symptoms, particularly abdominal pain.\n\n           As far as dietary management is concerned, simple dietary hygiene advice is offered as a first line of defence (3 meals a day, eat slowly, avoid excessively fatty foods, etc.). When these measures are already respected or are insufficient, patients can be offered a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAPs) over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. This diet eliminates malabsorbed carbohydrates and often results in improved digestive comfort. It is useful for this diet to be supervised by a dietician.\n<br />Table 1: list of main treatments\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Category of treatment\n|International non-proprietary name of treatment\n|-\n|Antispasmodics\n|Alverine + simethicone\n\nTrimebutine\n\nPhloroglucinol\n\nPinaverium\n|-\n|Laxatives\n|Osmotics: Macrogol\n\nBallast: Ispaghul\n|-\n|Transit retardants\n|Loperamide\n|-\n|Antidepressants\n|Amitriptyline\n\nRarely : Serotonin reuptake inhibitors\n|}",

The dose is 400 to 600 mg, to be repeated if necessary, without exceeding 1,200 mg/24 h. Paracetamol + codeine may be an alternative. Paracetamol alone and phloroglucinol are not recommended. The duration of treatment may vary from a few hours to a few days.\n\nFor the instrumental method, NSAIDs are recommended to limit intraoperative and postoperative pain. A dose of 600 mg ibuprofen can be administered pre-operatively.\n\n'''[[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]. [Prescribing analgesics SD-250|Prescribing analgesics. [[Prevention of pain associated with care SD-258|Prevention of pain associated with care]]. [Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|Assessment and management of acute pain]].''''\n\n===Failure===\nComplete failure is defined by a progressive pregnancy. The risk of complete failure in the case of instrumental abortion is exceptional (1 to 5 \u2030). The rate of progressive pregnancy after medical abortion is 1%.\n\nPartial failure is defined as an incomplete abortion. It is more frequent in the case of medical abortion. Two solutions may then be proposed:\n\n- instrumental suction\n\n- misoprostol per os\n\n===Mechanics===\nSpecific to the instrumental method :\n\ncervical tears in 0.2 to 1% of cases\n\nuterine perforation: 1 to 4 per 1000 operations\n\n===Haemorrhage===\nThe risk of haemorrhage after an abortion is 1%, with a transfusion risk of 0.1%. This risk is greater in the case of medically induced abortion.\n\n'''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|Genital bleeding during pregnancy]]. [Acute haemorrhage SD-060|Acute haemorrhage]]. [Palpitation SD-165|Palpitation]]. [[Tachycardia SD-166|Tachycardia]].''''\n\n===Infectious infections===\nThe risk of upper genital infection is around 1% after an instrumental abortion and 0.3% after a medicated abortion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only in the case of instrumental abortion. Particular attention should be paid to the clinical inflammatory syndrome after abortion, whatever the technique, so as not to overlook a type A Streptococcus pyogenes infection.\n\n===Deaths===\nThe risk of death due to abortion is of the same order as that due to spontaneous miscarriage (0.7 per 100,000).\n\n==Secondary complications ==\nThese are uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM). The persistence of ovarian tissue after a medicated or instrumental abortion can lead to a failure to resorb the peritrophoblastic vascularisation and the creation of a UAVM. The treatment for these complications is embolisation by interventional radiology in the event of haemorrhage.\n\n==''Long-term complications'''==\nAfter one or more abortions, there is no increased risk of :\n\ninfertility\n\nSCC, except where the interval between the abortion and the subsequent pregnancy is < 3 months\n\nof EP\n\nplacental anomalies\n\npremature delivery\n\nan increase in psychiatric disorders\n\nadenomyosis\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Complications'''\n|'''Medical abortion'''\n|'''Instrumental abortion'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |'''Immediate'''\n|Pain\n|Failure\n|-\n|Failure\n|Mechanical\n|-\n|Hemorrhagic\n|Hemorrhagic\n|-\n|Infectious\n|Infections\n|-\n|Deaths\n|Deaths\n|-\n|\n|Uterine perforation\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''Secondary''''\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Arteriovenous Malformation\n\nUterine (MAVU)\n|MAVU\n|-\n|Synechia\n|}\nSummary table of the main complications of abortion",

Our bodies can be seen or touched by others, but only we can experience them from the inside. We therefore have a different perception of our own body and the bodies of others. This difference is exacerbated in the case of patients, who experience the unique nature of an illness in their own bodies, and can be a source of dissension between carers and patients. Carers, being healthy, tend to see illness as a physical phenomenon requiring medical intervention, whereas for patients the experience of illness has an impact on their whole life. The patient's experience of illness triggers a search for meaning and gives rise to feelings (shame, fear) or behaviours (blame) that considerably increase their suffering.\n\nBy analysing the experience of pain, we can understand how illness alters our experience of the body.\n\nPain is not just a physiological fact; it is first and foremost a fact of existence. It is not the body that suffers, but the whole individual, in terms of the meaning and value of his or her life. Pain thus affects the sense of identity. People no longer recognise themselves for who they were. The people around them change their behaviour towards them. For better or for worse, pain profoundly transforms the person affected by it. It is not confined to an organ or a function; it is also moral. Toothache is not just in the tooth, it affects every aspect of a person's life.",

These have redefined the way in which we see and conceive of illnesses, but also the way in which we apprehend our bodies. As an artefact between carer and patient, between observer and observed, they redefine the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body, and transform the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images and data that can be reductionist.\n\nThe resulting observation is accompanied by its own terminology, which can also lead to distancing and create a gap between what is experienced by the patient (their subjective experience) and the way in which medicine objectifies their body.\n\nWhen it comes to the human body, the human sciences most often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The first is simply a body among bodies, impersonal, governed by natural laws, devoid of specifically human characteristics, an object of action or contemplation. The second, the subject-body, designates both the subjective body, as the psychophysiological substratum of the individual experience of the body, and the subject's body, as the dimension of corporeity on which the action of the human subject is exercised. In the world of healthcare, this distinction makes it possible to relativise and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without falling into the easy reductionism that would consist of directing the carer's attention to a single aspect of physicality.

Socially topical issues: sexuality, gender identity, filiation and parenthood.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Sol\u00e8ne Lellinger,Roberto Poma\n|Order=1}}\nThe body is a multidimensional object of study. This is why the humanities and social sciences have explored the human body in so many different ways. Whether approached through the prism of history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy or literature, the body offers an abundance of possible approaches to its study.\n\nRepresentations of what a healthy body looks like change with the times.\n\nThe choice of foods suited to human beings, the way we eat, physical exercise, gender assignment, the regulation of procreation and aesthetic standards are all social constructions that adapt to the constraints imposed by cultural traditions and the natural environment. The act of eating helps to reconstruct social logics and group identities. The presence of dietary prohibitions in several religious traditions, health regimes linked to different stages of life, particularly childhood and old age ('ageing well'), the impact of certain foods on the emotional and affective sphere, and the importance of gastronomy in the social interactions of certain groups, all place human food at the heart of a social, symbolic and economic system with implications for representations of the body in a given place and time. For example, overweight, which in the Renaissance was synonymous with good health, gradually became a major public health problem from the 1960s-1970s onwards. This change began in the 16th century with the evolution of beauty codes, illustrated by clothing habits such as corseting. So there are close links between aesthetics, the standards imposed by fashion and body standards. But this is also linked to the industrialisation and urbanisation of society, imposing a more sedentary lifestyle and leading to new consumer habits and a richer diet.\n\nFor sociologists, notably Pierre Bourdieu, the body performs at least three functions: that of memory, that of learning class habits and that of a marker of social position. The body thus appears to bear witness to inequalities between social classes, depending on eating habits or the type of work performed, which do not shape bodies in the same way.\n\nIn addition to social differences, there are also cultural differences. Voluntary transformations of the body, such as tattoos, piercings and scarification, have different functions in different eras and societies. There are also differences in the production of bodily norms and rules depending on the religion.\n\nAddressing the question of the body is intrinsically linked to the question of identity and in particular the construction of sexual identity. Becoming a man or a woman is thus also considered from the angle of the construction of social gender and not just that of biological differentiation (see item 58).",

After birth, skin-to-skin contact with the mother should be encouraged if the condition of the newborn and the mother allow it. Early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first hour) should be offered if breastfeeding is desired. Clinical examinations and care of the newborn are carried out in the presence of the parents.  Staying in hospital after giving birth is a good opportunity to support the parents and learn how to care for the newborn. This period also provides an opportunity to observe the family and identify any psycho-social difficulties.\n# Breastfeeding (Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding)  The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Breastfeeding has many advantages: - a nutritional model adapted to physiological needs; - reduced risk of infection; - prevention of atopy; - contribution to the mother-child bond; - economic advantage.  Breastfeeding should begin early (within the first hour of life). The mother should be given information on :  - correct positioning of the newborn; - correct latching of the baby; - nipple hygiene; - stopping smoking and alcohol consumption; - the frequency and duration of feeds (breastfeeding on demand, 8 to 12 feeds); - assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding (stools several times a day, copious urination, weight gain 200-250g per week);  - administration of vitamin K at 1 month of age and daily administration of vitamin D (1000 to 1200 IU); - complications of breastfeeding (insufficient lactation, sore and cracked nipples, engorgement, lymphangitis); - start of dietary diversification between 4 and 6 months of age.  Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (maternal HIV infection, maternal heart or kidney disease, galactosemia in children, certain drugs).\n# Regular medical check-ups (14 medical examinations during the first 3 years, including 1 in the first week, 1 in the second week and one a month until the child is 6 months old); - Preventive measures (unexpected infant death syndrome, transmission of infections, domestic accidents)'''(Prevention of [[Unexpected infant death syndrome : definitions 2C-345-DE-A01|unexplained death]] of infants, [[Prevention of domestic accidents SD-325|Prevention of domestic accidents]])'''; - Risks associated with passive smoking; - Prompt medical consultation in the event of fever before 3 months, eating difficulties, respiratory discomfort, diarrhoea, vomiting, unusual behaviour (''''[[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]]'''); - Vaccinations: check the parents' anti-pertussis vaccination and inform them of the child's vaccination schedule ('''[[Vaccinations for adults and children SD-322|Vaccinations]]] for adults and children)'''; - Sun protection; - Information on shaken baby syndrome ('''Suspicion [[Abuse and children at risk.

It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).\n\nThere are two pathophysiological phases:\n\n#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to na\u00efve LTCD8+. The na\u00efve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.\n#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification.jpg|vignette|Figure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification]]\n\n\nFigure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity according to the Gel and Coombs classification.\n\nModel of allergic contact eczema.\n\nAsymptomatic sensitisation phase (production of allergen-specific T lymphocytes on first contact)\n\nReveal phase on new contact (clinical eczema)",

CCHD is the result of an abnormality in the antenatal development of the hip, leading to instability of the joint or even dislocation at birth.  The risk factors for LCH are :  - family history of 1st degree CHL; - breech presentation whatever the mode of delivery; - limitation of unilateral or bilateral hip abduction; - congenital asymmetric pelvis;\n\n- associated postural abnormalities ('genu recurvatum', torticollis).\n\nScreening consists of a clinical examination at birth and then at each consultation until walking age and looks for :\n\n- asymmetry of the folds and lengths of the lower limbs;\n\n- abduction limitation <60\u00b0;\n\n- instability of the hip using the Barlow manoeuvre, which reveals a protrusion in the case of a \"dislocatable hip\" or \"reducible dislocated hip\". In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry.\n\nIf there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for LCH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed. After 4 months, the reference examination is a pelvic X-ray.\n\n# '''Hearing screening (Hearing loss/deafness)''' 5% of children under the age of 6 have a hearing defect. Congenital CMV infection is the leading cause of congenital deafness Risk factors for congenital deafness are :  - family history; - birth before 32 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <1800g; - perinatal asphyxia; - hyperbilirubinaemia >350 \u00b5mol/L; - neurological disorders; - malformation of the face and neck; - foetopathy (CMV, rubella, herpes, toxoplasmosis); - ototoxic treatment Screening is carried out systematically in maternity wards using induced acoustic emission tests (EAPT). If the examination is abnormal on two occasions, the newborn is referred to an ENT specialist for a check-up. If abnormalities are confirmed on examination, an audiogram and auditory evoked potentials will be carried out in a specialist centre.\n# '''Visual screening''' The risk factors for visual problems are :  - prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation; - neurological disorders; - deafness; - chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, etc.); - craniostenosis, craniofacial dysostoses; - embryo-fetopathies (toxoplasmosis); - in utero exposure to cocaine, alcohol; - family history of hereditary ophthalmological disease (congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, etc.).  Screening is based on clinical examination: - eyelids: ptosis, epicanthus, angioma; - eyeballs: microphthalmia, buphthalmia; - conjunctivae: redness, tearing; - corneas: symmetry of corneal reflections, corneal opacity; - pupils: leukocoria (retinoblastoma, cataract), aniscoria (neuroblastoma); - iris.  The examination assesses ocular pursuit with a target and looks for the presence of nystagmus.\n\nIntermittent and alternating strabismus may indicate delayed acquisition of oculomotricity up to the age of 3 months. Permanent or divergent strabismus, whatever the age, or present after the age of 3 months, should be considered pathological ('''[[Child Strabismus SD-157|Strabismus]]'')''.",

It is generally non-immunological, but in the case of immunological contact urticaria, anaphylaxis is still possible even after contact.\n\n2 examples:\n\n\u00d8 Allergic contact urticaria to latex proteins contained in latex gloves or objects is an immunological contact urticaria with a risk of anaphylaxis.\n\n\u00d8 Nettle contact urticaria is a non-immunological contact urticaria localised solely to the area of skin contact.\n\n\n- '''Les urticaires alimentaires'''\n\nFoods are very often implicated in urticaria, but IgE-dependent allergic food urticaria is rare.\n\nIn the case of acute food urticaria, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should be considered if :\n\n- the time between ingestion of the offending food and the onset of signs ranges from a few minutes to less than 2 hours;\n\n- there are associated symptoms which indicate the severity of the condition;\n\n- Symptoms resolve in less than 12 hours;\n\n- recurrence each time the food is taken, which is generally more severe, regardless of the quantity of food ingested.\n\n\n- Drug-induced urticaria\n\nMany so-called \"histamino-releasing\" drugs can promote non-immunological mast cell activation. This is the case with NSAIDs, antibiotics, particularly from the beta-lactam family, morphine derivatives and iodinated contrast products. These generally acute urticaria are non-allergic and occur several days after the drug has been taken.\n\nRare cases of acute urticaria are caused by immunological mechanisms via the activation of IgE antibodies specific to the drug in question; this is known as immediate hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.\n\nIn the case of acute drug-induced urticaria, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis should be made when ;\n\n- a delay of less than 2 hours between the introduction of the drug and the appearance of acute urticaria;\n\n- the existence of associated extracutaneous signs of anaphylaxis\n\n- resolution of the urticaria within a few hours of stopping the suspected drug\n\n- recurrence, which is generally more severe and more rapid, when the suspected drug is re-administered\n\n\n- Infectious urticaria\n\nThis is usually acute urticaria resulting from an infection.\n\nMany viral, bacterial and parasitic infections, and sometimes vaccinations, can be associated with the onset of urticaria, which is usually acute.",

DCs are usually very effective in the short term against AD flare-ups. Long-term efficacy studies are very rare. DCs are classified according to their potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak activity) and their galenic form (cream, ointment, lotion and gel).\n\n\n'''The choice of a DC depends on four criteria: age, location of lesions, extent to be treated and oozing nature of lesions.'''\n\n\n<u>choice of galenical</u>:\n\n-ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas\n\n-cream for oozing areas, folds and large skin surfaces\n\n-lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children)\n\n- scalp gel (rarely used in children)\n\n<u>The choice of activity level</u>\n\n-Very strong DCs are contraindicated on infants and young children, and on the face, folds and seat.\n\nHigh-activity CDs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated in children on lichenified lesions, on the extremities and on lesions resistant to moderate-activity CDs.      \n\nModerate-activity CDs are used on the face and body of infants and children.\n\nlow-activity CDs are of no interest because they have little or no efficacy.\n\nnumber of applications per day\n\nA single application per day is just as effective as several applications, and makes it easier to adhere to treatment.  \n\n<u>quantity to be applied</u>\n\nThere is no maximum quantity recommended during the initial treatment.\n\nThe amount required to maintain remission during maintenance treatment should not normally exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity CD for children and 60 g/month of high-activity CD for adults.\n\nDuring the maintenance period, it has been shown in children and adults that the systematic use of a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on the skin areas usually affected for 4 months reduced the number of flare-ups without side-effects. This method of using DCs (pro-active treatment) is particularly suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups that recur rapidly when DCs are stopped.\n<br />\n\n=== 3) Emollients ===\nEmollients improve the functional signs of skin dryness and some of them temporarily restore the skin's barrier function.\n\nThe use of emollients is recommended by professional agreement from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as a maintenance treatment throughout the duration of AD, regardless of its severity.\n\nprecautions for use:\n\ninterruption for a few days during a highly inflammatory flare-up (frequently poor tolerance)\n\n-Galenics to be adapted to the patient's preferences\n\nFragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitisation.

It is a process integrated into care, adapted to the patient's needs, which includes a range of information and learning techniques provided by one or more carers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, .....) during programmes involving consultation(s) and/or meetings in small groups. The aim is to help patients and/or their families become more independent, to encourage them to adhere to treatment and to combat corticophobia, which is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\nOther treatments :\n\noral antihistamines (anti-H1): no proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase apart from an old study / interest in hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during the flare-up period in young children with sleep disorders\n\n\n-Topical immunomodulator: tacrolimus (in France) - indicated for flare-ups of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (facial lesions++).\n\n\n-Systemic treatments: treatment of severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated (risk of rebound on discontinuation).  ",

This means that people with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection. The incidence of prosthesis-related IE is estimated at around 5% at 5 years.\n\nEarly AEs (<1 year after implantation) result from peri-operative contamination (catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation, etc.). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).\n\nLate IEs (>1 year after implantation) originate from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are therefore those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).\n\n\nClinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. In addition, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.\n\nThe diagnostic strategy for ARs on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves (see item 152).\n\nAntibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.\n\nThe indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following being particularly favourable: the presence of clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, an uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, the presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by \"Staphylococcus Aureus\".\n\nThe prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends above all on clear information being given to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.\n\nTherapeutic education is essential, particularly with regard to signs that should prompt consultation (prolonged fever, AEG). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.\n\nDental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.\n\nThe antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure. In the event of allergy, Clindamycin is used (600mg in adults, 20mg/kg in children).",

The position of individuals on the social ladder influences the conditions in which they grow up, learn, live, work and age, and their vulnerability to disease and its consequences\". (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants of Health).\n\nFor example, difficulties in accessing housing or employment, a polluted and noisy living environment, the experience of exclusion or inequality... All these factors can add up to a multiplier effect.\n\nDiscrimination increases stress\n\nExperiencing discrimination contributes to the stress experienced by people who are subjected to it, which can result in poorer cardiovascular health. People exposed to ethno-racial discrimination are in poorer health according to a meta-analysis (Paradies 2015). This discrimination is a risk factor for depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, as well as for suicidal behaviour (Bardol et al. 2020). They can accumulate in people's experience and 'wear them down' (Wilkinson 2015). The accumulation of disadvantages has a corrosive dimension (Pelet, Charles and Dergham 2020).\n\nDiscrimination can also make it difficult for professionals to practise, particularly because of the tension between ethical requirements and the reality on the ground.\n\n'''Discrimination is a major contributor to non-take-up.''''\n\nNon-take-up occurs when people affected by public policies do not use the benefits or services to which they are entitled. Non-take-up is a widespread phenomenon, particularly in healthcare: in addition to factors linked to geographical distance, territorial disparities and unequal health literacy, discrimination can be a direct contributory factor. Anticipating rejection, stigmatising remarks, having to pay in advance or having to pay more, people from vulnerable populations and/or in economically precarious situations may decide not to visit a professional, delaying their treatment or worsening their state of health. In addition to encountering difficulties in accessing healthcare or facing barriers that prevent them from accessing care, some people no longer find their place in the social protection and healthcare system and no longer accept the nature of the interactions it offers (https://odenore.msh-alpes.fr/).",

It includes the care teams and/or the family.\n\n\n'''<u>Know the particularities of pain management in the elderly</u>''''\n\n\n'''Spotting'''\n\n- Some types of pain are predictable (pain during care, pressure sores, etc.), even if this is not specific to the elderly (see \"Prevalence and epidemiology\" section), while others are more difficult to anticipate (paroxysmal attacks of pain) or to identify.\n\n- You need to look for \"warning signs\" and have a pain reflex, especially if the behaviour is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming.\n\n- Any elderly person who expresses pain or behaviour suggestive of pain is indeed in pain. We need to apply the \"precautionary principle\" and fight against preconceived ideas, beliefs, fears and representations held by patients and those around them, such as \"It's normal to be in pain when you're old\".\n\n\n'''Evaluation'''\n\n- The patient will be correctly seated (environment, wearing of glasses, hearing aids and dental prostheses), with an empathetic and patient approach, a climate of trust and taking into account any cognitive or expressive difficulties.\n\n- A \"geriatric assessment\" (including depression and behaviour) is carried out in addition to identifying the components of the pain.\n\n- Self-assessment is carried out using a simple numerical or verbal scale rather than the VAS. In the event of failure, an observation of behaviours using a ''hetero-evaluation'' scale (Algoplus\u00ae, Doloplus\u00ae, ECPA\u00ae) is used, preferably in a team, and this evaluation is repeated regularly.\n\n\n'''Treatment'''\n\n- Ageing ''modifies the pharmacology'' (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy) of drugs, including analgesics. The analgesics and coantalgesics used are the same as those used by younger adults, but the adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous because of \"co-morbidities and polymedication\". The contribution of clinical pharmacists can be useful in screening for drug-related iatrogenia and in drug conciliation.\n\n- Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexists in the elderly.\n\n- Before any analgesic is prescribed, the patient's state of health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation and compliance must be ascertained. Dosage adjustments are recommended, dosages increased slowly (\"start low and go slow\"), and renal function monitored.\n\n- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.\n\n- It is recommended that analgesics be combined with non-pharmacological techniques, which are perfectly feasible with a few adaptations to the sensory deficits caused by ageing (sight, hearing, mobility).\n\n\n'''Revaluation'''\n\n- Always reassess to ''adapt and prioritise'' treatments in order to reduce multi-medication and optimise the benefit-risk balance.\n\n- An elderly patient who does not complain can be painful.",

It can be carried out with sperm from a spouse ('''IAC'') or from a donor ('''IAD'').\n\nInsemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to obtain maturation of one to three follicles, or induction of ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders ([[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|Menstrual Cycle Disorders]]: anovulation or dysovulation).  \n\nPelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation. This is known as ovulation monitoring.\n\nOvulation is triggered by injection of recombinant hCG to synchronise ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition.\n\nThe day after the induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory, under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected (similar to the migration-survival test, see LISA sheet for item 38). The sperm preparation is inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.            \n\n*In Vitro Fertilisation''''' conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.\n\n<u>Ovarian stimulation</u> under supervision (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) by administration of high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked at the same time by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n\nThese protocols require ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH and progesterone levels). The aim of this monitoring is to :\n\n*check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing),\n*choose the optimum day for ovulation induction,\n*identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g. insufficient ovarian response).\n\nOvulation is triggered when several follicles have reached a size greater than 16 mm by injection of either an hCG analogue (recombinant hCG) or a GnRH agonist.\n\n<u>Follicular puncture</u> (of the follicular fluid) is performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anaesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory where it is examined for cumulo-ovocyte complexes.\n\n<u>Sperm preparation</u> is carried out in the majority of cases using a '''sperm sample taken by masturbation'' on the day of the follicular puncture. However, it is also possible to use frozen sperm from a spouse or a third-party donor. It is also possible to use sperm taken surgically (either from testicular tissue (testicular biopsy) or from the liquid in the epididymis (epididymal puncture)) in cases of azoospermia (sperm which will then be used fresh or after freezing). Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinised urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). The spermatozoa recovered are prepared according to the \"in vitro\" fertilisation technique envisaged.\n\n<u>Fertilisation</u> is either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).\n\n<u>Culture and embryo transfer</u>: after fertilisation of the oocytes by sperm, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on a number of factors.\n\nA pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.\n\n<u>Embryo freezing</u>: non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and then kept in storage tanks containing liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are first thawed and then transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.\n\n\nThe MPA can be :\n\n*intra-marital'' (using the gametes, oocytes and spermatozoa of both members of the couple)\n*or with the intervention of a ''third party donor'' (sperm donor, oocyte donor or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure and for which the couple no longer have any parental plans).\n\nDouble gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible (French Bioethics Act 2021).\n\nPGM can be carried out in the context of \"viral risk\" (HIV, hepatitis B and/or C) in centres approved for this activity. Finally, one of the techniques used in MAP is \"pre-implantation diagnosis\" (PGD), the aim of which is to diagnose genetic anomalies (genes, chromosomes) in embryonic cells. Only a few AMP centres are authorised to carry out PGD in France.\n\n<br />",

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n\n'''<u>Know the tools and scales for assessing pain in communicating and non-communicating adults</u>''''\n\n'''General principles '''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.\n\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\n\nIt generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).  \n\n\n<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:EVA adults.png|EVA adult\nFile:EVA child.png|Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n</gallery>\n                                                                             \n\n\n                                                                      \u00a0      \n\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less co-operative patients (asthenia, fatigability).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| None\n\n         pain\n|\n\n\n  0\n|\n\n\n1\n|\n\n\n  2\n|\n\n\n  3\n|\n\n\n  4\n|\n\n\n  5\n|\n\n\n  6\n|\n\n\n  7\n|\n\n\n  8\n|\n\n\n  9\n|\n\n\n10\n|Pain\n\nmaximum\n|}\n\n\n'''The Simple Verbal Scale (EVS) (or categorical scale)'''\n\nAimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones.\n\nIncludes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain.

Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently included in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds mean that clinicians must consider finding the cause of the pain and treating it.",

They mainly concern mechanical valves, but also biological prostheses, particularly those implanted percutaneously. They are more frequent in the first year.\n\nThree main risk factors have been identified:\n\n- Prosthesis in mitral/tricuspid position versus aortic position (lower pressure regime)\n\n- Presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular dysfunction\n\n- Old generation mechanical prosthesis\n\nA poorly balanced INR remains the main cause of thrombo-embolic complications in the case of mechanical valves.\n\nIn the case of mitral and aortic prostheses, they are manifested by systemic embolisms, potentially cerebral (TIA or stroke), more rarely embolisms responsible for acute limb ischaemia, splenic or renal infarction.\n\nMore rarely, obstructive prosthesis thrombosis may occur. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy, with a picture of PAO or cardiogenic shock. Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).\n\nDiagnosis is essentially paraclinical, with TTE and TEE showing an increase in trans-valvular gradients, a reduction in the functional valve area and sometimes an image of thrombus visible on the prosthesis. In the case of mechanical prostheses, radiocinema of the valve can also reveal blockage or reduced mobility of the leaflets.\n\nINR measurement is essential in any clinical situation where there is a suspicion of prosthesis thrombosis.\n\nThe management of acute prosthesis thrombosis may require emergency surgery, with a high mortality rate (around 30%).\n\nIn sub-acute forms or those with minor dysfunction, or in inoperable patients, correction of anticoagulation or the addition of an anti-aggregant, or even thrombolysis, may be suggested.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis remains infective endocarditis.\n<br />\n\n===='''''Prosthesis disinsertion'''''====\nDisinsertion of a prosthesis is responsible for a para-prosthetic leak, i.e. between the valve annulus and the Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM flange</sup>. The main aetiology to look for and evoke remains, above all, infective endocarditis. Suture loosening without infectious origin is also possible.\n\nThe clinical picture is one of aortic or mitral insufficiency, with severity and rate of onset depending on the speed of onset and grade of the leak.\n\nAuscultation therefore reveals a diastolic aortic murmur or a systolic murmur at the mitral focus.\n\nBiological tests may reveal haemolytic anaemia (increased LDH, reduced haptoglobin and presence of shizocytes), more frequently in the mitral position.\n\nThe key examination is TTE (and TEE), which reveals a Doppler flow of para-prosthetic regurgitation.\n\nDepending on the severity and rapidity of the leak, management may range from simple monitoring to surgical intervention. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, or in subjects at high risk of surgery, percutaneous closure may be discussed.\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 5 - TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak.jpg|vignette|656x656px|Figure 5: TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n===='''''Degeneration of bioprostheses'''''====\nThe main disadvantage of bioprostheses is that they degenerate over time. This degeneration most often expresses itself in a stenosing mode, more rarely in a receding mode (which generally progresses more rapidly) or in a mixed mode.\n\nThe average time before the appearance of ultrasound signs of degeneration is around 8 years.\n\nThe risk factors are male gender, implantation at a young age, renal insufficiency, abnormal calcium metabolism, dyslipidaemia, patient/prosthesis mismatch and bioprostheses in the mitral position.\n\n\nManagement ranges from simple monitoring in early forms to replacement of the degenerated prosthesis (either surgically or percutaneously).  \n\n[[File:Figure 6 - Bioprosthesis degeneration.jpg|thumb|Figure 6 : Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n\n===='''''Infectious endocarditis (IE)'''''====\nThis is a complication that should be systematically investigated in the event of a complication in a patient with a valve prosthesis.\n\nThe 5-year incidence of AR in valve prosthesis patients is around 5%, with the majority of events occurring in the first year following implantation.\n\nEarly postoperative AEs (<1 year after implantation) are mainly linked to \"Staphylococcus epidermitis\" or \"Aureus\".\n\nConversely, late postoperative AEs (>1 year after implantation) have a bacterial ecology similar to AEs on native valves (Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci).\n\nManagement is discussed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities, and the echocardiographic features of the IE. Antibiotic treatment is systematic, lasting at least 6 weeks, and may be combined with surgical management.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Other examples of bioprosthesis degeneration.png|alt=Bioprosthesis degeneration|thumbnail|953x953px|Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===='''''Hemorrhagic complications associated with VKAs'''''====\nThey concern patients with mechanical valves, but also patients with biological valves where curative anticoagulation is indicated (AF in particular). The risk is approximately 2% patient-years.\n\nThe symptoms vary: cerebral haemorrhage, digestive haemorrhage, haematuria, gingivorrhage, etc. A thorough clinical examination to look for any signs of seriousness is essential.\n\nManagement is the same as for an overdose of VKA (see Item 183).\n<br />",

Colour Doppler can be used to identify a paraprosthetic leak, i.e. a leak between the prosthesis and the native valve annulus.

Do not confuse ''thermal medicine'' with ''hydrotherapy'' (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or ''thalassotherapy'' (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognised nor reimbursed by the Health Insurance) or ''Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine''.\n\n==Waters used in Thermal Medicine ==\nThey are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The \"thermality\" separates \"cold\" waters (8 to 15\u00b0C, mainly for diuresis cures), \"mesothermal\" waters (25 to 34\u00b0C, for prolonged baths) and \"hyperthermal\" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The \"mineralisation\" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as :\n\n#SULPHUR: H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the \"Pyrenean\" type or calcic;\n#SULPHATE: urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium;\n#SODIQUE CHLORIDES: rich in sodium\n#GAS BARBONATES: sodium or calcium;\n#WITH A RARE ELEMENT: arsenic, iron, copper, selenium;\n#LOW MINERAL content: (trace metals).\n\nNB: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (\"griffon\") and to carry out the treatment on site.\n\nOther thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S) and mud (peloids).\n\n=='''Thermal techniques with 3 main types of cures <small>([[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explain a treatment to the patient]])</small>'''==\n\n#Internal hydrotherapy based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 litres per day) are used for digestive, urinary or metabolic disorders.\n#Contact\" cures: application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.\n#''External hydrotherapy'' uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional or general, of varying temperature, pressure and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.\n\nThe other thermal techniques are ''functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine'' (physiotherapy, postural drainage and respiratory re-education) and also health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place.

The 3 main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL) and Gr\u00e9oux (RH, VR).\n\n==Indications for spa treatment ==\nChronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialisation in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters).

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n'''Knowledge of pain assessment tools and scales for communicating and non-communicating adults'''\n\n'''General principles'''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several sites of pain, each site should be assessed separately.\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire (French version: questionnaire douleur de Saint Antoine), which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|-\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\nThis generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient, there is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).\n\n <gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:EVA adults.png\n</gallery>\n\n*Adult EVA\n\n<br /><gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Eva vertical.png\n</gallery>\n\n*\n\n Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less co-operative patients (asthenia, fatigability).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| No\n         pain\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n| 8\n| 9\n|10\n|Pain\nmaximum\n|}\n'''The Simple Verbal Scale (SVS) (or categorical scale)'''\n\nAimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones.\n\nIncludes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question \"are you in pain\"?\n|}\n'''Pain hetero-assessment scales''''\n\n- They are aimed at patients with ''verbal communication disorders''.\n\n- They require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behaviour and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioural scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently used in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, interruption of movement, etc.\n\nusual activities.\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds imply that clinicians should consider the search for the cause of the pain and its treatment.\n\n<br />",

I will respect all persons (...) without any discrimination according to their condition or beliefs\".\n\nPublic Health Code: health professionals must \"listen to, examine, advise or treat all persons with the same conscience, regardless of their origin, morals or family situation, their membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation or religion, their disability or state of health, their reputation or any feelings they may have towards them...\". (Public Health Code, art. R. 4127-7)\n\nThere are cases in which it may be legitimate to make differences, even on prohibited grounds such as nationality. For example, when recommendations were put in place in 2007 for vaccination against tuberculosis aimed at specific populations (children born in a highly endemic country or whose parents are from that country), the Directorate General for Health asked the Human Rights Defender whether this constituted discrimination. His response was that this targeted health policy did not constitute discrimination, given the public health issues at stake and the proportionate nature of the proposed rules. However, she called for great vigilance to ensure that this measure was not used to monitor the residency status of the target groups.\n\n\n'''Refusal of care as discrimination'''\n\nSituations of refusal of care are situations where certain people are refused treatment simply because, for example, they have a certain socio-administrative status.\n\n''Cas clinique''<ref>''Migration Sant\u00e9 Alsace, \"Vers plus d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9 : guide de pr\u00e9vention et de lutte contre les discriminations\", 2019,'' https://www.migrationssante.org/axes-dintervention/discriminations-et-sante/guide/</ref>'' :'''''Ms B., a patient of Romanian nationality, requested and obtained an appointment with a GP. On the day of the appointment, she was finally refused a consultation. The doctor gave two reasons: (1) the patient was in receipt of State Medical Aid (AME), which made it difficult for the Assurance Maladie to pay her; (2) the patient did not speak or understand French well.''  \n\nInvited to a mediation session following a complaint to the Order by an association accompanying the patient, the doctor was reminded that it is explicitly forbidden to refuse treatment on the grounds of a particular health cover (Article 1110-3 of the Public Health Code). Furthermore, the apprehension of administrative difficulties cannot, in itself, justify refusing care. Lastly, difficulty in communicating does not justify a refusal of care in the first instance. At the very least, a clinical examination is possible. Interpreting resources can be mobilised. In this case, the refusal of care was discriminatory and unlawful.\n\n'''Professional law and harm to individuals'''\n\n<nowiki>Some refusals of care are legitimate: for example, a professional is obliged to refuse care requested when it does not fall within his or her remit. Health professionals may also refuse to provide care, as expressly stated in paragraph 2 of article R. 4127-47 of the French Public Health Code: \"Except in an emergency or where he would lack humanity, a doctor has the right to refuse care for professional or personal reasons.[...]\".</nowiki>\n\nBut in all cases, the act of refusing care cannot be to the detriment of the individual, whose right to health is affirmed by texts of high normative value (the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1976, the European Social Charter of 1961 and 1996, and in France, the Preamble to the Constitution of 1946).\n\n\n'''The reality of discrimination in access to healthcare in France today'''\n\nDiscrimination is difficult to measure and understand. Testing is the most widely used method for establishing the presence of a social phenomenon of discrimination, making it possible to describe differences in treatment by healthcare professionals, for equivalent clinical cases but with distinct socio-cultural variables. A major study was carried out in 2019 on the differences in access to medical appointments in France depending on whether you are eligible for CMU-C (now ACS) or are of African origin. The results highlight strong discrimination based on economic vulnerability, with explicit and direct discriminatory refusals of care for 10 to 15% of the 1,500 professionals contacted. The study also found discrimination based on origin in some regions.\n\nThis study only describes the visible part of the problem:\n\n*Refusal of care is not always explicit and can take more insidious forms: late, unusual and abusive scheduling of an appointment, repeated and abusive referral to another practitioner or to a hospital outpatient department without a stated medical reason, refusal to draw up an estimate, non-compliance with applicable tariffs (except in cases provided for by law), refusal to waive the advance payment of costs for beneficiaries who have complied with the care pathway, etc. (CNAM, 2008, Circulaire CIR-33, \"Prise en charge des r\u00e9clamations et plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\", \"Prise en charge des plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\"). (CNAM, 2008, Circulaire CIR-33, \"Prise en charge des r\u00e9clamations et plaintes formul\u00e9es par les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires de la CMU compl\u00e9mentaire ou par les professionnels de sant\u00e9\").\n*Complaints about discriminatory treatment are rare, due to the difficulty of establishing the facts, particularly when they are not direct and explicit, and because the appeal bodies (CPAM, defender of rights, professional order, etc.) are often unknown and difficult to access.\n\n'''Psycho-social mechanisms: stereotypes and prejudice'''\n\nTesting can reveal discriminatory behaviour that becomes visible on a large scale. It does not, however, make it possible to establish discriminatory \"intent\". But for the sociologist interested in understanding discrimination phenomena in all their social dimensions, discrimination is a structural rather than an individual phenomenon, and has real consequences, in particular by producing new inequalities beyond those on which it is based.\n\nFor example, a racist or homophobic act suffered by a person does not simply result in verbal or physical aggression. It is part of a continuum for the person being discriminated against because of their otherness in relation to a stereotyped identity that has become the norm. All social groups have social representations that give them access to a common meaning and a grid for reading experience.\n\nDiscrimination is caused or facilitated by some of these social representations. '''Stereotypes''' are simplifying representations that are relatively rigid and not always of good quality<ref>Jean-Baptiste L\u00e9gal, Sylvain Delouv\u00e9e. ''Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination''. Dunod, 2015.</ref>. A stereotype may be advantageous or disadvantageous, but it is always simplifying. We attribute such and such stereotypical traits to the group as a whole. '''Prejudices''' are preconceived opinions that are generally depreciatory about a group and predispose people to act unfavourably towards its members.\n\n\n'''Labelling patients and prioritising plains'''\n\nBecause of their training, working conditions and professional cultures, doctors use categories to classify and identify patients and their problems. Categorising people or situations in this way saves time in known or perceived situations, or in emergency situations. But categorising or labelling can lead to discrimination. Some labels that are very widespread and seem harmless (\"shrink\", \"CMU patient\" etc.) carry only simplifying connotations. Under no circumstances is their use based on validated scientific knowledge.\n\n''Cas clinique''<ref>''Migration Sant\u00e9 Alsace, \"Vers plus d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 en sant\u00e9 : guide de pr\u00e9vention et de lutte contre les discriminations\", 2019,'' https://www.migrationssante.org/axes-dintervention/discriminations-et-sante/guide/</ref>'': Mrs R., the daughter of a couple of Iranian nationality, complained of severe pain during childbirth. The midwife told one of her colleagues \"not to worry, that the patient's culture had to be taken into account and that it was a 'Mediterranean syndrome'\". But the patient was in the process of developing a serious complication''.\n\nYou might think that the professional was trying, in all benevolence, to take account of the culture of origin and adapt her care to the individual. However, this \"Mediterranean syndrome\" has no scientific basis. The ways in which pain is expressed vary both within and between cultural groups, and a person's geographical origin is not predictive of the way in which they will express their complaints<ref>Myriam Dergham, Rodolphe Charles, Le \"syndrome m\u00e9diterran\u00e9en\" : une stigmatisation par cat\u00e9gorisation des conduites de maladies, Medecine, volume 16, number 10, December 2020</ref>.\n\nThe use of a \"culturalist\" analysis grid, and therefore of stereotypes, can lead to discrimination, unbeknownst to professionals. It should also be borne in mind that healthcare professionals themselves come from a particular social background. They will therefore be more likely to understand patient signals with which they are familiar.\n\n\n'''Socio-historical mechanisms of discrimination'''\n\nDiscrimination is not only direct and conscious, it can also be indirect and systemic.\n\n*Discrimination primarily affects vulnerable populations, i.e. \"subgroups of the general population which, because of social, economic, historical, political or geographical factors, are exposed to greater risks and are therefore likely to be disadvantaged in terms of their state of health and/or their access to care\"<ref>Frohlich, K.L. and Potvin, L. (2008) Transcending the known in public health practice, the inequality paradox, the population approach and vulnerable populations. American Journal of Public Health, 98, 216-221. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2007.114777</ref>.\n*Discrimination (on the basis of origin, place of residence, gender, age) exists in access to housing, employment, leisure activities, etc. This discrimination itself has an adverse effect on the quality of life. This discrimination itself has an adverse effect on health (social determinants of health). So there are forms of discrimination that do not fall within the field of health, but which nonetheless affect people's health.\n*Finally, discrimination must be linked to social policies. Making access to certain rights more difficult, for example by tightening the conditions for obtaining a residence permit or restricting access to certain social benefits, reinforces inequalities in health. Paradoxically, certain policies that aim more specifically to give the most disadvantaged groups access to healthcare or rights can have the perverse effect of targeting these groups, and thereby stigmatising them.",

Historically, the first prostheses consisted of a ball that moved via the blood flow inside a cage (Starr\u00ae prosthesis), followed by tilting monodisc valves (Bjork-Shiley\u00ae). They currently have a double-wing design that moves on a central axis (Saint-Jude Medical\u00ae, Carbomedics\u00ae).\n\nThe fins open during the ejection phase and close during diastole. The ring is covered with Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM</sup> to anchor the prosthesis to the biological structure.\n\nThey have excellent durability, but require long-term curative anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis of the prosthesis. The recommended anticoagulants are anti-vitamin K.\n\n\nBecause of this anticoagulation and the risk of bleeding, their implantation is recommended in subjects under 60 years of age in the aortic position and under 65 years of age in the mitral position (Grade IIa / Level C).\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 1 - Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis.jpg|vignette|Figure 1 : Saint Jude mechanical prosthesis]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===='''''Biological stents'''''====\nThey are most often made from bovine pericardium (Carpentier-Edwards Perimount\u00ae, Carpentier-Edwards MagnaEase\u00ae, Medtronic Avalus\u00ae) which is mounted on a metal frame with a Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM</sup> collar. There are also bio-prostheses without a metal frame (the most commonly used is Freedom Solo - Sorin\u00ae).\n\nThere are also genuine porcine xenografts, such as the Medtronic\u00ae Hancok II. Finally, more rarely, homografts from human donors may be used.\n\nTheir durability is less than that of mechanical prostheses, with the development of stenosis or regurgitation on the valve prosthesis in the event of degeneration. Durability is estimated at between 10 and 15 years, depending on the position of the prosthesis, the type of prosthesis and the patient.\n\nTheir main advantage is that they are biocompatible. They do not require long-term anticoagulation if the patient is in sinus rhythm. In the mitral or tricuspid position, anticoagulation with VKA for the first three months following implantation (endothelialization time) is sufficient. In the aortic position, platelet anti-aggregation for the first three months following implantation (duration of endothelialization) is sufficient.\n\nTheir implantation is therefore recommended in subjects over 60 years of age in the aortic position, and over 65 years of age in the mitral position.\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 2 - Biological prosthesis.jpg|thumb|Figure 2 : Biological prosthesis]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n====''''' Percutaneous stents'''''====\nThey are most often made of porcine pericardium (Medtronic CorValve\u00ae) or bovine pericardium (Edwards Sapiens 3\u00ae) mounted on a metal stent deployed in the native aortic valve.

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196\u00b0C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196\u00b0C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196\u00b0C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells.

The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",

The main complication of this syndrome is the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, with phlebitis or pulmonary embolism of multifactorial origin, suspected in the presence of chest pain or dyspnoea following puncture. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) should be instituted in cases of proven ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If a pregnancy occurs during oocyte puncture, this thromboprophylaxis will usually be maintained during the 1st trimester of pregnancy.\n**Adnexal torsion'': an exceptional risk. It is linked to an increase in ovarian volume during ovarian stimulation, suspected in the presence of sudden, acute, lateral pelvic pain associated with pelvic defence. This is a surgical emergency.\n\n*Complications associated with ovarian puncture:\n**The risks associated with ''anaesthesia'' are common to all types of anaesthesia, local, sedation or general depending on the situation.\n**Risks associated with \"ovarian puncture\" are extremely rare (haemoperitoneum, pelvic infections including tubo-ovarian abscesses), intestinal or urinary tract lesions.\n\n*Complications related to the evolution of the pregnancy obtained:\n**The complications of the onset of pregnancy by MAP are the same as for a spontaneous pregnancy (risk of spontaneous miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy), the monitoring of the pregnancy is identical to that of a natural pregnancy.\n**The ''risk of gravid venous thromboembolism'' is slightly greater when a pregnancy occurs immediately after IVF-c or ICSI, compared with spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies after IUI.  \n**Multiple pregnancies\" are slightly more frequent, depending on the number of embryos transferred (1 or 2) and the multi-follicular response to stimulation in the case of IUI. The risk of prematurity, caesarean section, low birth weight and perinatal death is increased compared with a single pregnancy.\n\n*Long-term complications of MAP:\n**Risks inherent in the '''transmission of a possible genetic abnormality'' male or female responsible for infertility.\n**Potential excess risk of certain ''congenital malformations'' (musculoskeletal, cardiac, urogenital, etc.) and even cancer in the child in the case of IVF-c or ICSI techniques. However, these complications remain very rare in terms of frequency. In the current state of knowledge, the question of whether this risk is linked to the procedures used in MAP or whether it is linked to the intrinsic biological factors associated with the couple's infertility remains unresolved.\n**The data concerning the carcinological risks of patients undergoing MAP are very reassuring.\n\n<br />",

The paroxysm is reached in less than 3 minutes. In half the cases, the pain lasts for more than 30 minutes. ADP must be distinguished from pain attacks occurring at the end of a morphine dose?\n\n'''<u>Objectives and therapeutic principles of cancer pain</u>''''\n\nThe objectives of adequate analgesic treatment for cancer pain are :\n\n- No or low-intensity background pain.\n\n- Respect for sleep.\n\n- Fewer than 4 painful attacks per day with treatment efficacy > 50%.\n\n- Normal activities, although limited by the progression of the cancer, are still possible.\n\n- Minor or no adverse effects of treatment.\n\n<u>''Specific features of cancer pain treatments'' (Table 1)</u>\n\n\n- For nociceptive pain, this treatment is essentially based on the WHO levels'' and uses level I, II and III analgesics (see item 135): Level I analgesics are proposed for mild to moderate pain, Level II analgesics for moderate to severe pain, either immediately or in the event of non-response to Level I analgesics, and Level III analgesics (strong opiates) for severe pain, either immediately or in the event of non-response to the previous levels of analgesics.\n\n- ''For neuropathic pain, or in the case of an associated neuropathic component (mixed pain), the treatments are those for neuropathic pain'' (see heading in item 135): gabapentin, duloxetine, tricyclics, transcutaneous electrical external neurostimulation (TENS), local anaesthetic plasters.\n\n- Intramedullary analgesic treatments and peri-nervous blocks are indicated for bone pain, or pain refractory to previous treatments (neuropathic or nociceptive), especially if high doses of strong systemic opiates are required.\n\n- Psychological treatment by a qualified professional (clinical psychologist) is recommended in all cases.\n\n- Complementary pain relief techniques can be added to the previous treatments\n\n- Surgery, cementoplasty, vertebroplasty, radiotherapy and biphosphonates may be offered specifically for bone pain.\n\n- If high doses of systemic morphine are used, the implantation of a reservoir pump and an intrathecal catheter should be considered.\n\n- Radiotherapy is sometimes considered for pain relief (stereotactic radiotherapy in particular).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''Table 1.

If the couple separates, or if they do not wish to continue with their parental project, they may request that the embryos be destroyed, or that they be transferred to research or to another couple.\n\n<Gamete or embryo donation </u> is carried out in a public or not-for-profit establishment authorised for these activities, mainly in an egg and sperm study and conservation centre (CECOS). This involves the intervention of a third-party donor of spermatozoa or oocytes or a donation of embryos with a view to their reception (preserved as part of IVF-c or ICSI, for which there is no longer a parental project).

Since the Bioethics Act of 2021, children born from a donation will have the right, when they come of age, to request, if they wish, the identifying and non-identifying data of the donor (sperm, oocytes, embryos).\n\nThe number of children born from the same donor is limited to 10.\n\nDonors may be single or a couple.\n\nDonors are not required to have had children prior to donation.\n\n<u>'''Concerning fertility preservation'''</u>, the '''consent''' of the patient or of the holder of parental authority if the patient is a minor is obtained prior to the gametes or germ tissue being preserved.

In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.\n*Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches\n*AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: this requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.\n*Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent DR is a surgical \"semi-emergency\", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.\n*Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): this must be ruled out as an emergency.\n\n'''3.

C. difficile spores are resistant to hydroalcoholic solutions, so hand washing with soap must precede the application of SHA in this situation).\n\nEviction from the community is indicated in cases of shigellosis, enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi.\n\nVaccinations\n\n- There is a specific anti-rotavirus vaccination for children before the age of 6 months (live oral vaccines with a 2- or 3-dose schedule; risk of acute intestinal intussusception higher if administered after the age of 6 months), which is widely recommended in European countries, with an impact on severe forms of the disease and hospitalisations, even in older children (under 5 years old).

It may be used in patients aged 16 and over.\n\nFor these two vaccines, seroprotection against typhoid decreases rapidly during the first year (around 40% of those vaccinated are protected after one year, outside endemic areas). A booster is indicated between 24 and 36 months after the first injection for Typhim<sup>R</sup> and after 36 months for Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, if protection against typhoid fever is still required. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given as early as one year after the first injection of Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup> depending on the risk of contamination.\n\nUnder the age of 2, none of these vaccines induces an effective immune response.

In the absence of withdrawal, it leads to the development of optic atrophy.\n\n*drug-induced optic neuropathy: observed mainly during treatment for tuberculosis (ethambutol and isoniazid).

The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:\n\n*embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.\n*thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n*coagulation disorders.\n\nAetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, ''as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit''. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.\n\nThe \"treatment\" is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:\n\n*In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.\n*Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox\u00ae, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.\n*long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g. atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).\n\n== Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) ==\nCRVO is characterised by the following:\n[[File:OVCR.jpg|vignette]]\n\n*Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.\n*On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.\n*Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form;\n*Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.\n\nIn patients aged over 50, the ''etiological work-up'' is therefore usually as simple as possible:\n\n*to look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia;\n*as well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.\n\nIn cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).\n\nNon-ischaemic forms\" in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:\n\n*either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases);\n*the persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.\n\nIschaemic forms'', either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.\n\nThe development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to \"neovascular glaucoma\" (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).\n\nThe aim of ''treating'' a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.\n\nNo medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.\n\nTreatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox\u00ae) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.\n\n<br />",

The examination of the visual field (or perimetry) studies the sensitivity to light within this space by assessing the subject's perception of light tests of varying intensity and size. There are two main methods of examining the visual field: kinetic perimetry and static perimetry. Kinetic perimetry is particularly suitable for exploring peripheral deficits, particularly hemianopsia and quadranopsia. It is the examination method of choice in neuro-ophthalmology. Static perimetry is mainly indicated for optic nerve pathology, and in particular for diagnosing and monitoring chronic glaucoma. In fact, the first alterations to the visual field are very localised and central.\n\n'''B- Colour vision:''' it is useful to carry out a colour vision assessment to look for dyschromatopsia in two circumstances: 1- to detect a congenital anomaly, such as daltonism. coloured charts are used (pseudo-isochromatic charts, the best known of which is the lshihara chart). 2- in the presence of an acquired ocular condition. The Farnsworth test is usually used, in which the patient is asked to classify coloured tablets. The study of colour vision thus helps in the diagnosis of certain retinal disorders and optic neuropathies. It is also an essential element in monitoring treatments likely to cause retinopathy (synthetic anti-malarials) or optic neuropathy caused by drugs (mainly anti-tuberculosis drugs: ethambutol and isoniazid).\n\n'''C- Fundus angiography:'''' This involves taking images of the fundus after intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye which, depending on the indications, is either fluorescein or indocyanine green. Fluorescein angiography thus provides a dynamic study of retinal vascularisation. Injection of indocyanine green is mainly used to visualise pathological choroidal vessels (vascularisation of a choroidal angioma, choroidal neovessels during age-related macular degeneration).\n\n'''D-''' '''Electrophysiological investigations:'''''\n\n'''1. electroretinogram (ERG):''' The ERG is the recording of the retinal action potential secondary to light stimulation of the retina using a corneal electrode. The ERG reflects a global response of the retina and is only altered in the case of ''extensive retinal lesions'', for example certain hereditary retinal dystrophies.\n\n'''2. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs):''' they represent action potentials arising in the occipital cortex following light stimulation of the retina: they therefore explore the optic pathways in their entirety, from the ganglion cell to the occipital cortex. They can be used to diagnose optic neuropathies, and are particularly useful in multiple sclerosis, where they can be altered in the absence of any clinically detectable optic neuropathy.\n\n'''3. The electro-oculogram (EOG):''' it measures the activity of the pigment epithelium.\n\n'''E-''' '''Ultrasound:''''' The main purpose of A-mode ultrasound is to assess the length of the eyeball; the main purpose of B-mode ultrasound is to detect any retinal detachment in the case of ocular media disorders, to search for and locate an intraocular foreign body or to help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.\n\n'''F-Optical coherence tomography (OCT):''' it is used to obtain high-precision slices of the retina. Its main application is the study of macular disorders: premacular membrane, macular hole, macular oedema (diabetes, AMD), visualisation and localisation of choroidal neovessels (AMD). This method is also used to screen for and monitor chronic glaucoma, as it can reveal the loss of optic fibres, the first sign of glaucoma.\n\n'''E- Complementary examinations of the anterior segment:''''\n\n*Corneal topography: This is used to gather information about the curvature or relief (elevation) of the cornea, by projecting and analysing the reflection of a light pattern illuminating or scanning the cornea. The images collected are analysed in the form of colour maps. It is prescribed for analysing astigmatism, particularly in the search for keratoconus.\n*Biometry: this is a combined measurement of the curvature of the cornea (or keratometry) and the anterior-posterior (axial) length of the eye. The measurement is carried out using an optical device. It is used to calculate implant power in cataract surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />",

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n'''Knowledge of pain assessment tools and scales for communicating and non-communicating adults'''\n\n'''General principles '''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|-\n|'''L'\u00c9chelle Visuelle Analogique (EVA)''''\n\nIt generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient, there is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).  \n          \n<gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:EVA adults.png|EVA adults\n</gallery>\n                     \n<gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Eva vertical.png\n</gallery>\n Vertical EVA (child) (https://sparadrap.org)\n\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment. Visual support can help in critical situations (pre-hospital, emergency, intensive care, post-interventional care room) or with less co-operative patients (asthenia, fatigability).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| None\n\n         pain\n|\n\n\n  0\n|\n\n\n  1\n|\n\n\n  2\n|\n\n\n  3\n|\n\n\n  4\n|\n\n\n  5\n|\n\n\n  6\n|\n\n\n  7\n|\n\n\n  8\n|\n\n\n  9\n|\n\n\n10\n|Pain\n\nmaximum\n|}\n\n\n'''The Simple Verbal Scale (EVS) (or categorical scale)'''\n\nAimed at patients who are generally unable to use the previous ones.\n\nIncludes qualifiers such as: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain, very severe pain. The EVS should not be simplified to the simple question \"Are you in pain?\n|}\n\n'''Pain hetero-assessment scales'''\n\n- They are aimed at patients with ''verbal communication disorders''.\n\n- They require the clinician to observe the patient's pain behaviour and quantify it using a validated score: these scales are also known as behavioural scales. Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently included in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- hypertonia and movement of the limbs, agitation or absence of movement, interruption of movement, etc.\n\nusual activities.\n\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity. These thresholds imply that clinicians should consider the search for the cause of the pain and its treatment.",

This subretinal fluid (SRF) will lift the retina from close to close: this is DR.\n\nA number of \"factors\" contribute to the occurrence of a DR:\n\n*Age: idiopathic DR, linked to posterior physiological vitreous detachment in the elderly.\n*Myopia, particularly severe myopia (myopia greater than -6 dioptres): the risk of rhegmatogenous DR increases with the degree of myopia;\n*Cataract surgery (aphakic or pseudophakic DR), which is complicated by DR in around 2% of cases, with a variable delay, sometimes several years after the operation on the lens.\n*Trauma\n*Uveitis\n\nThe spontaneous course of the disease is very unfavourable: the DR inexorably spreads, encompassing the macula and then the entire retina. Within a few weeks, the detached retina suffers irreversible damage leading to blindness.\n\nThe ''suggestive clinical signs'' of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment are:\n\n- myodesopsias followed by phosphenes corresponding to the onset of the retinal tear\n\n- amputation of the peripheral visual field, corresponding to the formation of the DR\n\n- when the DR lifts the macula, it causes a drop in visual acuity (white, painless eye).\n\nA fundus examination, including examination of the peripheral retina, is used to:\n\n*make the diagnosis: the retina appears raised, mobile, forming voluminous folds\n*search for the causal tear: the surgeon must try to find several tears, as multiple tears are common and failure to identify one or more tears can lead to failure of the surgical treatment.\n\nThe ''treatment'' is solely ''surgical'': its principle is to seal the peripheral retinal tear, stopping the passage of LSR; the residual LSR is then resorbed by the pigment epithelium and choroid, allowing the retina to replicate. The anatomical (around 90% success rate) and functional prognosis of surgical treatment is better the earlier it is performed, especially when the macula is raised by the DR. DR is therefore considered a \"semi-emergency\", warranting surgery within a few days of diagnosis.",

The discovery of these mechanisms led to the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation and spinal cord electrical stimulation to treat certain types of pain.\n\n- Supra-segmental modulation mechanisms (''Figure 2) originate in brain structures, particularly in the brainstem (periaqueductal grey matter, raphe nuclei, etc.) and involve different neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.\n\n- They are also called ''descending controls'' because they are able to modulate, either by inhibiting or facilitating it, the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord in a very powerful way.\n\n- Bringing these modulation systems into play makes it possible to account for classic clinical observations such as the ''absence of a direct relationship between the size of a lesion and the resulting pain'' and, more generally, the influence of psychological, cognitive, contextual and cultural factors on the experience of pain.\n\n- Alterations or dysfunctions in these systems are involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic pain syndromes.<gallery perrow=\"1\">\nFile:Untitled.png 2.png|Figure 1: supra-segmental modulation (inhibitory controls from the brainstem).\n</gallery>\n\n\n'''<u>Pathophysiological elements</u>''''\n\n- Classically, we distinguish \"3 main types of pain\" on a physiopathological basis, even if certain mechanisms (particularly central) are common to these different types of pain. These main types of pain may be associated (e.g. postoperative pain which is typically nociceptive but frequently associated with a neuropathic component).\n\n\n''Pain caused by excessive nociceptive stimulation'' (or nociceptive pain).\n\n- These pains, secondary to various tissue lesions (trauma, burns, infection, malignant processes, etc.), are the most frequent in clinical practice.\n\n- In this case, the nociceptive systems are intact and it is considered that they are linked to the over-stimulation of these systems, notably due to the inflammatory reactions frequently observed in this context.\n\n- Visceral pain\" related to distension of cavities or spasm of smooth muscles (e.g. gastroenteritis, colitis, renal colic, hepatic colic, etc.) is related to pain caused by excess nociception (stretching of the walls, often associated parietal inflammation, etc.).\n\n- Inflammatory processes lead to hyperactivation of the nociceptors (''peripheral sensitisation'') linked to the action of a large number of pro-nociceptive substances (bradykinin, H+ ions, prostaglandins, histamine, substance P, NGF, etc) released during inflammation and liable to directly activate or sensitise the nociceptors.\n\n- Under conditions of inflammation, nociceptors that are normally silent when not stimulated become spontaneously active and their evoked responses are increased and appear with a lower threshold.\n\n- These peripheral mechanisms can secondarily induce central modifications consisting mainly of phenomena of \"central sensitisation\" and \"alterations in modulation systems\", which play a decisive role in the perpetuation of certain types of pain and explain certain therapeutic failures aimed solely at acting on peripheral factors.\n\n- The mechanisms of central sensitisation are complex. In particular, they involve NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptors, the activation of which is linked to the significant increase in the central release of glutamate due to the prolonged activation and sensitisation of nociceptors.\n\n- The cascade of intracellular events triggered by the activation of these NMDA receptors is at the origin of a long-lasting hyperexcitability of central nociceptive neurons (''central sensitisation'') which contributes to increasing and amplifying the pain and could account for the transformation of certain acute pains into chronic pains.\n\n\n'''Neuropathic pain.'''\n\n- They are linked to lesions or diseases of the somato-sensory system and in particular the nociceptive system. They are most often associated with a sensory deficit (deafferentation) and cannot therefore be explained by simple overstimulation of the nociceptors.\n\n- They depend on secondary peripheral and central mechanisms that help to amplify and perpetuate the pain.\n\n- One of the most well-documented peripheral mechanisms is the appearance of '''''ectopic discharges''''', i.e. electrical activity (action potentials) which originate aberrantly at the nerve lesion. These foci of abnormal discharges result from the accumulation at the lesion site of dysfunctional ion channels, in particular certain subtypes of specific sodium channels, whose physiological role is to regulate membrane excitability.\n\n- The profound metabolic changes associated with nerve damage are responsible for a reduction or increase in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides (glutamate, substance P, BDNF, etc.) which are responsible for secondary central changes.\n\n- The central mechanisms are mainly: the development of ''central sensitisation'' phenomena, alterations in modulation systems or neuroplasticity (reorganisation of somato-sensory systems) which contribute to amplifying and perpetuating pain.\n\n\n'''Nociplastic''' (or dysfunctional) pain\n\n- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome, which are characterised by the absence of an identifiable lesion likely to explain the pain.\n\n- The pathophysiology of these pains is less well known, but the best documented hypothesis at present is that they depend mainly on ''alterations in pain control and modulation systems'', with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.\n\n<br />",

It is characterised by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.\n\nHorton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) is the cause to be considered first, even though it is not the most common cause, due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered as an \"emergency\". A systematic search should therefore be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease; changes in the temporal arteries; suggestive ocular signs (episode(s) of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography, indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), temporal artery biopsy (this should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralisation and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids as a matter of urgency.\n\nArteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. One or more risk factors are generally present: smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.\n\n=== '''Papilledema''' ===\nThis is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.\n\nIn cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.\n\n=== '''Retro-bulbar optic neuritis (RBON)''' ===\nDamage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.\n\n\nOther causes of optic nerve damage include:\n\n- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: these neuropathies have in common that they are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead), metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).\n\n- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumours or tumours in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n== Damage to the optic chiasm ==\nCompression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as \"chiasmatic syndrome\" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e. a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibres which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.\n\n== Retrochiasmatic disease ==\nThis results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibres travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive haematoma), tumour and trauma.\n\nA sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumour etiology.",

A drop of the diluted allergen to be tested is placed on an area of healthy skin. A small quantity of the allergen is then introduced into the epidermis by \"pricking through the drop\" (with a microlance or needle).

The diameter of the urticarial papule must be at least 3 mm greater than the papule in the prick test carried out with the negative control (more often than not, the negative control does not produce a papule and is therefore \"perfectly negative\").\n\nThere are \"two conditions for declaring a prick test with the allergen to be negative\": 1) no papule on the test itself, 2) urticarial papule obtained on the histamine prick test (if there is no urticaria on the histamine test, the skin is not reacting overall and the negative test with the allergen is therefore uninterpretable).\n\nRare and usually mild side-effects of prick test: widespread local reaction, generalised urticaria, syndromic reaction (rhinitis, asthma). Exceptional anaphylactic reactions\n\n\n2) ''Patch tests'' explore ''delayed reactions'' and are usually performed on the patient's back, also on healthy skin. The allergen to be tested is placed in a small occlusive cup which is left in place for 48 hours. The cup is then removed and the test interpreted. The patch is considered positive if the area tested has an \"eczema-like\" appearance, indicating a local reaction of the delayed hypersensitivity type (see Lisa item 187: Eczema).\n\n\nRare and usually benign side-effects of the patch: eczema extending beyond the patch area or even spread of eczema to other areas (exceptional).\n\n\n3) ''Intra dermo-reaction'' (IDR) consists of injecting the allergen intradermally and carrying out either an immediate reading at 15 minutes (investigation of type I HS with deep urticaria associating local oedema, erythema and pruritus), or a delayed reading (investigation of type IV HS with infiltrated and often pruritic erythema at 48 hours).\n\n\nRare and usually benign side-effects of TST: those of pricks and patches, depending on the type of reaction investigated.\n\nVery rare cases of anaphylaxis during DSTs (mainly during hymenoptera venom tests and sometimes drug tests).",

Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitisation and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).\n\n\n'''Allergens''' = antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n- Pneumallergens = airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.\n\n- Trophallergens = food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.\n\n- Occupational allergens = allergens present in the workplace\n\n'''Physiopathology of allergic hypersensitivities'''\n\nAll allergic hypersensitivities have two phases\n\n- A phase of ''central sensitisation'' ''in the lymph nodes'', ''asymptomatic'', which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3, see below), or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4, see below).\n\n- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.\n\n\nThere are 4 types of hypersensitivity\n\n\n1- Type 1 hypersensitivity or immediate hypersensitivity\n\no This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).\n\no It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens,\n\no After their synthesis (sensitisation phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.\n\no During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to :\n\n\u00a7 the ''release of stored mediators'' (histamine, proteases);\n\n\u00a7 the ''synthesis of other inflammatory mediators'' from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes);\n\n\u00a7 the production of ''chemokines'', which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and ''cytokines'', which perpetuate inflammation.\n\no These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation and oedema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis (''cf Lisa item 338'').\n\no Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.\n\n\nDiagram of IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity\n\n\nType 2 hypersensitivity or antibody-related cytotoxicity reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise an \"allergen carried by a target cell\".\n\n- Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.\n\n- Example: drug-induced cytopenia\n\n\nType 3 hypersensitivity or immune complex reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise a \"circulating allergen\".\n\n- Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or \"circulating immune complexes\")\n\n- which are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells;\n\n- Example: hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.\n\n\nType 4 hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity\n\n- Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitisation phase. The memory T cells recognise the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.\n\n\nFor example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema (cf Lisa item 187) and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g. pulmonary granulomatosis).",

This is generally achieved after one month.\n\nSpecial cases: In certain exceptional cases, if the patient is asymptomatic, if the initial \u03b2-hCG level is less than 1,000 IU/L and if the kinetics of \u03b2-hCG show a progressive and constant decrease, it may be possible to discuss abstention from treatment subject to good compliance by the patient (\u03b2-hCG measurement every 48 hours and clinical and ultrasound monitoring once a week). The patient must be informed of the risk of failure.\n\nRemember to check the patient's blood group to prevent anti-D alloimmunisation if necessary.",

In this case, the patient most often describes a reduction in the number of weekly bowel movements, with rather dehydrated stools (small and hard because they remain in the colon for longer).\n\n''If it's distal constipation also known as dyschesia'', it may be :\n\n- a functional disorder (lack of anal sphincter relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter during thrusting, disturbance of rectal sensitivity) and/or\n\n- an \"anatomical\" disorder with a disturbance of pelvic statics (rectocele, descending perineum, internal rectal procidence, etc.)\n\nIn the case of distal constipation, the patient most often describes exaggerated pushing efforts, a feeling of incomplete evacuation and sometimes recourse to digital manoeuvres to encourage evacuation (most often in the case of anatomical disorders).\n\nNB: The two mechanisms of constipation can coexist.\n\n\nB) ''Secondary constipation'': indicative of an organic disease, digestive or extra-digestive, which should be investigated during the interview.\n\nAny recent or recently aggravated constipation should be investigated for an organic cause, primarily colonic stenosis. A medicinal or toxic cause should be systematically sought in patients complaining of recent constipation.\n\n\nThe possible causes of secondary constipation are presented in Table 1.\n\n\nWarning signs :\n\n- changes in general condition, weight loss\n\n- nocturnal and insomniac pain\n\n- rectal bleeding, melena\n\n- severe, persistent constipation that does not respond to treatment or worsens without any obvious cause\n\n- Rectal syndrome (epithelial discharge, tenesmus, false urination)\n\n- abdominal or rectal mass\n\n- biology: anaemia, inflammatory syndrome\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Digestive causes''''\n|Extra digestive causes\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |\n\n\n- Luminal obstruction (colorectal or small bowel cancer)\n\n- Non-tumour stenosis (diverticular, inflammatory, ischaemic)\n\n- Anal stenosis (anal canal cancer, inflammatory stenosis, scarring)\n\n- Extrinsic compression: benign or malignant tumour (e.g. ovary), peritoneal carcinosis, post-surgical adhesions, endometriosis, prolapse, etc.\n<br />\n|\n\n'''Neurological:'''\n\n- Parkinson's disease\n\n- Multiple Sclerosis\n\n- Spinal cord injury\n\n- Ponytail syndrome\n\n- Cerebrovascular accident\n\n\nNB: It is estimated that almost 50% of patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases have transit disorders.\n<br />\n|-\n|\n\n'''Metabolic:''''\n\n- Diabetes\n\n- Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency\n\n- Hypercalcaemia, hypocalcaemia\n\n- Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia\n<br />\n|-\n|\n\n\n'''System diseases:'''\n\n- Scleroderma\n\n- Amyloidosis\n<br />\n|-\n|'''Drug or toxic causes:''''\n\n- oral iron\n\n- antidiarrhoeals\n\n- analgesics (opiates, tramadol), antispasmodics\n\n- anticholinergics\n\n- antidepressants (carbamazepine), antipsychotics, anticonvulsants (amitriptyline), antiparkinsonian drugs\n\n- hypokalaemic diuretics (furosemide)\n\n- resins (cholestyramine)\n<br />\n|}\n<br />",

However, it has a low sensitivity and high inter- and intra-individual variability. It should be carried out after laxatives have been stopped.\n\n\nAnorectal manometry\n\nThe aim of this examination is to identify a functional disorder of exoneration. In fact, dyschezia, which is a clinical symptom, may show up in anorectal manometry as abdomino-perineal asynergy (or asynchronism), i.e. the absence of relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter when pushing.\n\nIt is usually performed without prior preparation, in a conscious patient lying on his or her left side. The principle is to use a probe introduced via the anal route and topped by a balloon.\n\n\n'''Morphological examinations'''\n\n'''- Defecography'''\n\nThe aim of this dynamic radiological examination is to look for an anatomical disorder causing dyschezia (problems with pelvic statics). It involves opacifying the rectum and, more often than not, the urinary and gynaecological tracts, and performing pushing movements. It is most often carried out when conservative treatments have failed and surgery is being considered.\n\n\n'''- Defeco-MRI or dynamic pelvic MRI'''\n\nThis examination is an alternative to defecography and the choice between the two examinations depends on the centres and the habits of the medical and surgical teams.\n\n\n'''- Opaque enema in children:''''\n\nThis examination is indicated in cases of suspected Hirschprung's disease.",

There are many types of diffuse interstitial lung disease (DIL), both acute and chronic, and very often the involvement is not limited to the interstitial sector but may also extend to the alveolar or vascular sectors. Radiologically, Diffuse Interstitial Diseases have the following features in common:\n\n*usually diffuse, bilateral involvement\n*a risk of progression to a fibrosing form with a poor prognosis\n\n\n'''Radiography'''\n\nChest X-rays are routinely taken, but do not always enable a precise diagnosis to be made. It may also be normal. Opacities are generally bilateral, diffuse, non-symmetrical, reticular and/or micronodular. Lung volume may be reduced when fibrosis is present.\n\n'''Tomodensitometry'''\n\nA thoracic CT scan is essential for a precise analysis of the symptomatology, integrating it into the clinical-biological context and suggesting diagnostic ranges.

Atelectasis can also be passive (pulmonary collapse on contact with a pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome, for example) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).\n\nAtelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by ''a direct sign and indirect signs''.\n\n#Direct sign'': opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity has the following characteristics\n#*Systematised with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.\n#*No aeriform bronchogram.\n#Indirect signs: corresponding to the consequences of the reduction in volume of the affected area.\n#*Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma\n#*Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart and hilum\n#*Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome\n#*Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories\n\nChest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to \"specify the site of the obstruction\" (endoluminal, wall or extrinsic) \"and its nature\" (foreign body, tumour, etc.).\n\n\n'''Example of parenchymal atelectasis on chest X-ray (Figures 1-3):'''\n\n(NB: TDM images are provided for illustrative purposes)<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Atel1.JPG|'''Figure 1'''.

The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. There are many other causes: intra-alveolar haemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organised pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.\n\nThe definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:\n\n*pulmonary opacity (denser or \"whiter\" than normal parenchyma)\n*containing images of aerated bronchi (= aerated bronchogram)\n\nThe term \"systemic\" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe (Figure 1). The silhouette sign can help to localise the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term \"retractile\" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, we speak of ''''''athelectasis''.\n\nCT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray, and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary oedema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.<gallery widths=\"700\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Alv1.JPG|'''Figure 1.'''

On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard x-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures (Figure 1). Any displaced rib fracture should be scanned for pneumothorax, haemothorax or laceration of the lung parenchyma.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:3.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. A. Chest X-ray in a polytrauma patient showing several displaced right rib fractures (arrows) that are difficult to see. B.

On clinical examination, a paradoxical movement of the hemithorax is observed. A rib flap is a serious injury often requiring intensive care and sometimes surgical treatment.\n\nDamage to the first three ribs is a marker of high-energy trauma, and may be associated with vascular or nerve damage (brachial plexus). Involvement of the 8th to 11th costal arches should prompt a search for an upper abdominal injury (hepatic or splenic).<gallery widths=\"900\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:4.jpg|'''Figure 2'''.

The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumour pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, oesophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia).\n\n'''Identification of an abnormal mediastinal image'''\n\nReading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum), which involves analysing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density (Figure 1).<gallery widths=\"650\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediastpedia1.jpg|'''Figure 1. Mediastinal reflection lines.'''

It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.\n\nThe aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:1.jpg|'''Figure 1'''.

Aneurysm of the aortic arch. G-H. Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos.\n</gallery><br />Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths=\"800\" heights=\"600\">\nFile:2.jpg|'''Figure 2''. A-B.

Squamous cell carcinoma is rarer (30 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year).  Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is 2 to 3 times more common in men than in women.\n\n\nThe risk of developing carcinoma is higher in subjects with a light phototype (I and II) and the incidence increases with age.\n\nSun exposure is the main factor promoting carcinomas, both chronic and cumulative exposure (EC and BCC) and intense and intermittent sun exposure (BCC).\n\nImmunosuppression (organ transplants, chronic haematological diseases, HIV infection, etc.) is also a risk factor for skin carcinomas.\n\nCarcinomas develop mainly in areas exposed to light, particularly the face and back of the hands.\n\n\nThe phototype corresponds to an individual's ability to interact with the sun. Six phototypes are defined according to eye colour, hair colour, the presence of ephelides (freckles), sensitivity to sunburn and the ability to tan (Fitzpatrick phototype classification).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nThe incidence of melanoma varies throughout the world depending on the phototype of the population and UV exposure (latitude). In France, it is 15 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year and has been rising for several decades.\n\n\nThe main risk factors for developing melanoma are :\n\n- Light phototype (blond or redhead, ephelides, light eyes)\n\n- High number of nevi (>50)\n\n- High number of atypical nevi (>10)\n\n- Personal history of melanoma\n\n- Family history of melanoma (10% of melanomas occur in a family context)\n\n- Sunburn in childhood or sudden, intense exposure to the sun.\n\n\nIn the majority of cases (80%), the melanoma appears de novo and not on a pre-existing nevus or precursor.\nPhototype\nReaction to the sun\n!phenotype\n|-\n|I\n|Tanning = 0\nSunburn = systematic\n|Very fair complexion\nLight eyes\n\nBlonde or red hair\n\nNumerous ephelidesh\n|-\n|II\n|Brown = +/- (with difficulty)\nSunburn = often\n|Very fair complexion\nBlonde or chestnut hair\n\nUV-induced ephelides\n|-\n|III\n|Tanning = gradual\nSunburn = sometimes\n|Light complexion\nBrown eyes\n\nBlonde or chestnut hair\n|-\n|IV\n|Tanning = easy\nSunburn = little\n|Matt complexion\nBrown or chestnut hair\n\nDark eyes\n|-\n|V\n|Tanning = very easy\nSunburn = exceptional\n|Dark skin\nDark hair\n\nDark eyes\n|-\n|VI\n|Tan = constant\nSunburn = absent\n|Dark skin\nDark brown eyes\n|}",

The higher the number of CAG triplets, the earlier and more severe the onset of the disease.\n\nClinical signs include abnormal movements, psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.\n\nThe abnormal movements are primarily chorea, which spreads progressively and can affect the hands, feet, face and trunk. As the disease progresses, dystonic abnormal movements and a parkinsonian syndrome may be encountered.\n\nPsychiatric disorders often involving mood (sad mood, moral pain) and/or behaviour initially correspond to a change in personality, disinhibition, depression, [[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]], sometimes a suicide attempt or psychosis ([[Delusional ideas SD-124|delusional ideas]], rare [[Hallucinations SD-122|hallucinations]]).\n\nAssociated with this is a subcortical-frontal [[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|cognitive decline]] with a dysexecutive syndrome progressing to dementia. [Apathy SD-117|Apathy]] (lack of interest and motivation) and anosognosia are frequent.\n\nThere is usually a family history. There are sporadic forms, which can be misleading in cases of early death of one of the parents (censorship), false paternity or anticipation.\n\nThis condition involves the [[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]] and the [[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]].

Tremor==\nInvoluntary rhythmic oscillation of all or part of the body around its position of equilibrium. There are two main types of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]]: those which occur in muscles at rest and those which occur in activated muscles (i.e. in action) with postural and intentional components often associated.\n<br />\n\n==B. Chorea==\nSudden, random, anarchic movement, often of the rotation or flexion/extension type, non-stereotyped, arrhythmic, without purpose, affecting various territories (face, neck, trunk, limbs), present at rest and in action, occurring against a background of hypotonia.\n\nWhen this type of movement is proximal (affecting the roots of the limbs) and has a large amplitude, we speak of ballismus (most often linked to a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus).\n\n==C.  Dystonia==\nInvoluntary, prolonged muscle contractions responsible for abnormal posture and/or repetitive movements, aggravated by movements in the vicinity of the affected area and stereotyped. It may therefore involve abnormal posture and/or movement. Dystonia is therefore a cause of [[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|localised or generalised muscle contracture]] which can give the impression of [[Joint stiffness SD-056|joint stiffness]].\n\nFocal dystonia: a segment of the body is affected as in spasmodic torticollis (also known as cervical dystonia, characterised by torsion of the neck), blepharospasm (focal dystonia responsible for [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|palpebral anomaly]]) linked to dystonia of the orbicular muscles of the eyelids and characterised by abnormal, iterative and prolonged occlusions of the eyelids.\n\nFunctional dystonia: dystonia occurs during a particular gesture or function (e.g. writer's cramp, musician's cramp).\n\nHaemidonia: damage to one of the hemi-bodies.\n\nGeneralised dystonia: involvement of at least one lower limb and the trunk.\n<br />\n\n==D. Myoclonus==\nSudden muscle jerks originating in the central nervous system. They may be segmental (focal or multifocal) or generalised, isolated (arrhythmic) or repetitive (rhythmic, giving the impression of an irregular tremor). These muscular jerks are positive myoclonias, whereas negative myoclonias are sudden resolutions of muscle tone (as in asterixis or \"flapping tremor\"). Myoclonus may be cortical, subcortical (linked to dysfunction of the basal ganglia), reticular, pontine or spinal in origin.\n\n==E. Tics==\nA tic is a sudden, brief, intermittent, stereotyped movement without purpose (a \"caricature of a normal gesture\"), which is repetitive. It may be preceded by a premonitory sensation (internal sensation of the need to move preceding the tic) and can be controlled by the will for a few minutes at the cost of increasing internal tension and a rebound phenomenon occurring after the control effort. The tic is the most frequent abnormal movement.\n\nThe tic may be simple, involving just a few muscles (blinking, shaking the head, shrugging the shoulders, etc.) or complex, involving an elaborate motor sequence (putting the right hand under the left armpit and adducting the left shoulder to crush the right hand).\n\nMotor tics are the opposite of vocal tics (screaming, sniffing, throat clearing, forced exhalation, etc.) which may, rarely, correspond to obscenities known as coprolalia.\n\n==F.

Resting tremor (or parkinsonian tremor) ===\nResting tremor (or Parkinsonian tremor) is present at rest and disappears during muscle contraction and sleep, is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, never the head or voice, is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. It is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigrostriatal pathway]] but is not mandatory for diagnosis.\n\nTremor SD-128|trembling]] can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, in particular Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome (see below).\n\nIf the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is aged over 40, no further tests are necessary.\n\nConversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.\n\n===2.  Action tremor===\n- Present when maintaining a posture ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] postural) and/or arriving at the target ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] intentional).\n\nThe most common cause of postural [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]] is essential [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]].\n\nThis is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head, which progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre) or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre), performs an action such as pouring water from one glass to another (the glass test) or holds a note aloud (voice tremor). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.\n\n===3.  Cerebellar tremor===\n- This is an action [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor).\n\n- Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test).\n\n- Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria (and not a genuine speech and/or phonation disorder) on finger-nose and heel-knee manoeuvres, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre) and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability and incoordination of movements.\n\n- Similarly, in the event of an acute cerebellar syndrome, vitamin B1 should be measured/supplemented in order to search for/treat Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy, which may be responsible for mental confusion/disorientation.\n\n- Acute drunkenness is a frequent cause of acute cerebellar syndrome and warrants prevention of alcohol-related risks.\n\n- The acute onset of a cerebellar syndrome warrants a [[request for a cerebral imaging test]] in search of a cerebellar ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, which may be the cause of compression of the fourth ventricle responsible for hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, which may also be the cause of [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]. \n\n===4.  Exaggeration of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] physiological:===\nExaggeration of the [[Trembling SD-128|trembling]] physiological: in this case there is systematically the [[suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care]] (see below). Particular circumstances (hyperthyroidism: analysis of thyroid balance with TSH measurement; excessive consumption of caffeine) may cause an exaggeration of the physiological tremor (which is a normal phenomenon, of muscular origin, not linked to an attack on the central nervous system), which may then be confused with a tremor of another nature.\n\n===5.  [[Tremor SD-128|Trumbling]] functional (or psychogenic)===\nThis is a [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that does not correspond to any neurological pathology described above. It is usually characterised by a sudden onset (often in an emotional context or in a patient with psychological fragility), distractibility (during a competing task, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] disappears or changes), frequency entrainment (during a motor task performed by the contralateral limb at a given frequency, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] tends to adopt the same frequency). It may be present both at rest and in action (which is unusual), may disappear spontaneously, and may be polymorphous and atypical (neurological abnormalities that cannot be systematised, etc.). It tends to occur in people with a history of somatisation.",

Knowing the situations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis.\n|Rubric=Positive diagnosis\n|Contributors=Claude F\u00e9rec,Elise Launay,Caroline Schluth-Bolard\n|Order=12}}\n\n'''Epidemiology of cystic fibrosis'''\n\nCystic fibrosis of the pancreas or mucoviscidosis is the most common serious genetic disease of children in populations of European origin. It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It affects one in every 4,700 births.  One subject in 35 is a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in France is F508del.  Life expectancy at birth is over 40 years.\n\nSituations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis\n\n- Ultrasound monitoring\n\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be raised during ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy when a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign which may reveal a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in around 5% of cases. This risk is increased if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by an absence of visualization of the gallbladder. A study of the CFTR gene is then carried out in the couple. If mutations in the gene are detected in one or both of the couple's partners, the mutations are tested in the foetus using an amniotic fluid sample.  \n\n- Family history of cystic fibrosis\n\nBoth parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation.\n\nThe risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhoea, or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhoea. Once the foetal DNA has been extracted, molecular biology is used to determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is only known for one parent, a full study of the CFTR gene must be carried out for the other spouse to determine the risk.\n\nOne of the parents has cystic fibrosis\n\nA parent with cystic fibrosis must pass on one of the two mutations he or she carries. It is necessary to determine the status of the spouse by carrying out an exhaustive study of the CFTR gene.  If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",

Medical complications need to be treated early and rehabilitation needs to be started quickly. Rehabilitation can take place in the private sector or in a CAMSP (Centre d'action m\u00e9dico-sociale pr\u00e9coce for 0-6 year olds) then SESSAD (Service d'\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale et de soins \u00e0 domicile, up to the age of 20).\n\nThroughout life, it is important to know how to look for the main complications (see [[Evolution of trisomy 21|2C-045-SP-A01]]) and to treat them in order to avoid, in particular, over-handicap (vision problems, hypoacusis, hypothyroidism).\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 have a margin of progression, which varies from one patient to another and is impossible to predict. They have a psychomotor delay ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|anomaly of psychomotor development]]). For example, walking is acquired on average between 2 and 3 years of age, compared with between 9 and 18 months for a child without Down's syndrome. Language acquisition is often the most delayed, accompanied by speech disorders ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]).\n\nPuberty proceeds normally.\n\nPeople with trisomy 21 are often short (over - 2 DS) ([[Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]) and have a tendency to develop obesity which should be treated by hygienic and dietary measures and by encouraging the practice of sport.\n\nThe majority of children with Down's syndrome are able to recognise words, and even to read, write a few words and count a little, allowing them a degree of independence.\n\nInclusion in the mainstream environment should be encouraged as far as possible, either in normal classes or in adapted classes (ULIS: Unit\u00e9s Localis\u00e9es pour l'Inclusion Scolaire). If the child has reached his or her limits in terms of acquiring school skills, he or she may be admitted to an IME (Institut m\u00e9dico-\u00e9ducatif) or an IMPro (Institut m\u00e9dico-professionnel) to work on independence and learn a trade.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome can be housed (rare). They can work in a mainstream workplace (rare), work in an ESAT (\u00c9tablissement et service d'aide par le travail, the majority), stay with their parents or move into a so-called occupational home.\n\nAdults with Down's syndrome usually have an emotional life and some women (rare) have children.\n\nIn adulthood, the question arises of guardianship, curatorship or family administrative supervision to protect these people, particularly financially.\n\nFrom their fifties onwards, people with Down's syndrome begin to experience the complications associated with premature ageing and an increased risk of dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer's type ([[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|memory impairment/cognitive decline]]).\n\nLife expectancy is estimated at 60 years.",

Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).\n\n'''Attention'''\n\n- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''', '''[[Mental Confusion/Disorientation SD-119|mental Confusion/Disorientation]]''' (which result from severe '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''') and '''[[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and Consciousness Disorder]]'''''\n\n- Attention is necessary for all the major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.\n\n- Tests by repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.\n\n'''Perceptual integration functions'''\n\n- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects and the body schema.\n\n- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe), and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.\n\n- '''Temporal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Aphasia''' ('''[[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]]''') by impairment of comprehension, '''visual agnosia''' (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects (colours or shapes) or more complex ones (faces, manufactured or living objects)\n\no Tests understanding of simple commands (\"close your eyes\"), naming of objects or faces.\n\n- '''Parietal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Apraxia''' (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), '''visual neglect''' '''unilateral''', i.e. inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), '''disturbance of the representation of the body schema'' (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc).\n\no Tested by copying a geometric figure (MMSE image), drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (\"military salute\", \"nose-thumbing\") and gestures involving the use of objects (\"brushing teeth\", \"combing hair\", \"playing the violin\", \"hammering a nail\").\n\n'''Memory'''\n\n- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.) but in the tests, ''episodic memory'' is mainly assessed.\n\n- '''Episodic memory''' :\n\no the ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e. the place, the moment, the emotional state)\n\no the critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or \"consolidation\")\n\no depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the ''hippocampi'' and adjacent cortices.\n\no Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to \"progressive forgetting\" (\"What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?\").\n\n- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.\n\no 1. read five words (\"Museum\", \"Lemonade\", \"Colander\", \"Grasshopper\" and \"Truck\") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (\"What is the drink?\"...).\n\no 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).\n\no 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g. a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.\n\n'''Executive functions'''\n\n- Mental operations enabling the individual to '''understand the context'' of the action, to d''''inhibit automatic or reflexive behaviour'' and to '''generate voluntary behaviour'' directed towards a goal.\n\n- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.\n\n- '''Dysexecutive syndrome''' leads to a lack of contextualisation (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgement and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviours (repetitive and stereotyped ''[<nowiki/>[[Obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour SDD-136|obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour]]]''') and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food ''[<nowiki/>[[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SDD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]]''', disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).\n\n- Tested using the ''rapid frontal efficiency battery'' (BREF)",

In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.\n\nIn verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterised by :\n\n- no encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words)\n\n- a collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge)\n\n- above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word \"truck\": \"what was the vehicle?\"), with clues often causing \"intrusions\" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.\n\nConsolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the \"five-word test\", a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item \"free recall/indexed recall\".\n\nThis profile of memory impairment :\n\n- as opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).\n\n- results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome)\n\n- is a good clinical argument in favour of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease)\n\n- is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD)\n\n- is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.",

A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome. The children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced but pregnancies are possible.

The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to think of it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process the patient is given information so that, on the one hand, she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure and, on the other, once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for a variety of reasons ranging from the material difficulties encountered by families (identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult carrying trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",

It involves examinations carried out on pregnant women to diagnose a disease (infectious, haematological, genetic, etc.) in the foetus.\n\nIf a risk has already been identified in the family, the couple can decide to\n\n- the absence of any particular action and the assumption of the stated risk;\n\n- adoption ;\n\n- a request for prenatal diagnosis ;\n\n- a request for pre-implantation diagnosis.\n\nAntenatal diagnosis can also be carried out following the identification of an anomaly during pregnancy monitoring (biological or ultrasound). The couple's proposal for an examination is discussed at the CPDPN (Multidisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis). The couple is then offered genetic tests ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]) which require invasive sampling to collect foetal material (cells, DNA), most often by chorionic villus puncture or amniocentesis.\n\no Fetal karyotype if an abnormality in chromosome number is suspected;\n\no Chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (ACPA or CGH array) in cases of suspected unbalanced chromosomal abnormality other than an abnormal number;\n\no Targeted sequencing/analysis in cases of suspected gene syndrome or genetic disease identified in the family;\n\no Some centres are beginning to offer exome testing in cases where there is a suspicion of a gene syndrome but no clear indication;\n\n\nIf a woman is diagnosed with a particularly serious illness that is incurable at the time of diagnosis, she may request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG) on medical grounds, regardless of the term. This request is discussed at a CPDPN and may be accepted if the illness meets the 2 criteria mentioned above:\n\n- Particular gravity ;\n\n- Incurable at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThe CPDPN can also suggest drug therapies and, in rare cases, surgery to treat the foetus, as in the case of diaphragmatic hernia.\n\n\n'''Prenatal screening for trisomy 21'''\n\nDoctors must inform patients of the possibility of [[Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 SD-307|prenatal screening for trisomy 21]], which is covered by the health insurance scheme. This screening must be preceded by information to the patient about trisomy 21 and the screening procedures, and requires her prior written consent. The screening process is not compulsory and the patient may withdraw from the process at any time.\n\nScreening enables a risk to be assessed, but does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In the event of positive screening, the definitive diagnosis will be made by carrying out a foetal karyotype.\n\nIn the event of a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 21, it is essential to arrange a systematic consultation with a geneticist to provide information on the prognosis and genetic counselling, prior to any decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, even if the parents decide to do so in advance.",

Spermatic cord torsion is manifested by acute, intense, unilateral, sudden scrotal pain, usually nocturnal. The pain is continuous, with no analgesic position, and radiates towards the inguinal region, along the spermatic cord towards the iliac fossa. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. When questioning the patient, it is important to find out when the symptoms began. The bursa is painful, enlarged, sometimes red and warm. During lifting manoeuvres, the bursa remains painful (negative Prehn's sign). The testicle is elevated and retracted at the inguinal ring. The cremasteric reflex is absent.\n*''Orchiepididymitis'': Before puberty and after the age of 35, orchiepididymitis is usually associated with urinary tract infections in children and adults (urogenital infections 161) and sexually transmitted infections (STI): gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis (trichomoniasis 162). From puberty to the age of 35, orchi-epididymitis is frequently secondary to a sexually transmitted infection. The clinical presentation of orchi-epididymitis is painful enlargement of a bursa. It may be associated with a progressive fever, or more rarely a sudden onset. Its intensity varies according to the pathogen, and the pain is associated with local signs of varying intensity: scrotal pain radiating along the cord, progressive and not sudden onset (as opposed to torsion of the spermatic cord), painful induration of the cord and all or part of the epididymis. The scrotum is inflamed. Lifting the testicle usually relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign), making it possible to distinguish torsion. Any doubt about the diagnosis of torsion of the spermatic cord (particularly in the absence of general signs and functional urinary signs) should lead to surgical exploration to rule out torsion.\n*''Scrotal trauma''': Most often, this is a young patient who, following direct perineal or scrotal trauma, presents with acute, intense scrotal pain. There may be nausea and vomiting. Clinical examination reveals a large non-inflammatory bursa (haematocele: blood in the vaginal cavity), with a scrotal haematoma. Transillumination is negative (haematocele), but clinical examination is often difficult because of the severity of the pain. It is therefore impossible to assess the integrity of the testicle. Several types of lesion may be found:\n**Scrotal haematoma (rare)\n**Intra-testicular haematoma\n**Haematocele: blood effusion inside the vaginal cavity. It is the result of testicular rupture.\n**Testicular contusion: the albuginea is intact and there is no intra-testicular haematoma.\n**Testicular fracture: there is a rupture of the albuginea with exit of the testicular pulp into the vaginal cavity.\n**Lesions of the testicular appendages (epididymis or spermatic cord): lesions of the epididymis are rare and the cord is most often respected by the trauma due to its mobility.\n\n==A painless, enlarged bursa should prompt the diagnosis of:==\n\n*''Testicular cancer'' ([[Testicular tumours|item 313]]): Testicular cancers occur in young men (aged 15-35). Cryptorchidism is the main risk factor for testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is discovered in the following circumstances: autopalpation, infertility test, gynaecomastia, prevalent metastasis. The testicle is hard, stony, irregular and not very sensitive. The tumour markers are: alpha-feto-protein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Biopsy is contraindicated and diagnosis is made by inguinal orchiectomy.\n*An inguinal or inguino-scrotal hernia is a painless swelling of the groin fold (unless strangulated), which can be reduced when coughing.\n*A hydrocele is the accumulation of intravaginal serous fluid between the testicle and its vaginal envelope. The clinical presentation is that of an enlarged, painless bursa. Questioning may reveal variations in volume during the day, particularly in children (communicating hydrocele secondary to the persistence of a permeable peritoneo-vaginal canal). Positive transillumination confirms the diagnosis.\n*In adults, the hydrocele is non-communicating and linked to an anomaly of the vagina. The hernial orifices are free.\n*A cord cyst'': the clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a regular painless swelling, suspended above and independent of the testicle, without pain.\n*''A varicocele'': A varicocele is the varicose dilatation of the veins of the pampiniform plexus of the cord. A varicocele may be discovered during a systematic examination, an isolated deformity of the scrotum, a functional symptom such as discomfort, heaviness, especially when standing or during intense or prolonged physical effort, often relieved by decubitus, as part of an assessment of male infertility, or very rarely associated with local complications: non-traumatic rupture or thrombophlebitis. Inspection in the standing position may reveal a deformity of the posterior and upper part of the scrotum, of varying size, behind the testicle and along the cord, which diminishes with decubitus. Palpation reveals a varicose swelling that is impulsive on coughing and increases in volume on exhalation with the glottis closed (Valsalva manoeuvre), and whose consistency is sometimes compared to that of a \"bag of worms\". Varicocele is common and even normal in young pubescent adolescents on the left side (blood reflux from the left renal vein into the left gonadal vein). A varicocele should be considered suspicious on the right side or of recent onset [[Neoplasms of the kidney|(kidney cancer 311]]), compressive adenopathy, venous thrombosis). In this case, imaging (ultrasound or abdominal CT or MRI) is recommended.\n\n=='''Cryptorchidism''': is defined as a testicle spontaneously and permanently located outside the scrotum, at any point along the normal path of testicular migration. Cryptorchidism excludes:==\n\n*oscillating or ascending testicles, which may descend spontaneously into the scrotum and which, in young boys, hyperactivity of the cremaster causes to ascend to the superficial inguinal ring\n*ectopic testicles, which are located at a point outside the normal path of testicular migration. The location may be perineal, femoral, pubo-penile or contralateral intra-scrotal. Ectopia may be observed in cases of scrotal trauma (dislocation).\n*The examination should be carried out gently, with warm hands and the child lying supine, thighs apart and legs half-bent, so as to achieve complete muscle relaxation. The inguino-scrotal region is palpated with both hands, the upper hand pressing firmly on the abdominal wall to bring the gonad downwards while the lower hand moves upwards from the scrotum. When the cryptorchid testicle can be palpated, its position, both spontaneously and after manipulation, its volume and consistency must be specified. The testicle may be normal or atrophic and soft. If examination of the inguino-scrotal region is negative, the testicle should be sought in an ectopic position. Following a complete examination, several clinical situations may arise:\n**Unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism with palpable testicles (80% of cases)\n**Non-palpable testicles (20% of cases)\n**Bilateral cryptorchidism with non-palpable testicles: An endocrine investigation and a karyotype should be performed to rule out anorchidism or a sexual differentiation disorder.\n\n=='''Anomalies of the penis''' are:==\n\n*Phimosis'': phimosis is defined as a relative stenosis of the preputial orifice which prevents complete retraction of the skin behind the glans. It is physiological in children up to the age of 5. When it appears in adulthood, it must be considered pathological (scleratrophic lichen, cancer of the penis, unbalanced diabetes mellitus).\n*Paraphimosis: this is a complication of phimosis. It is secondary to forced retraction of the preputial ring with forgetfulness or inability to recalibrate. In the absence of recalibration, oedema of the prepuce and glans will form and create a constriction in the balanopreputial groove.\n*'''Penile thickening''': This is noticeable during erection. In children (congenital curvature), it is noticed either by the parents, or by a doctor during a systematic examination or by the adolescent. In most cases, it is associated with hypospadias. In adults, it is secondary to fibrous plaques of the corpora cavernosa (Lapeyronie's disease item 126), which are painful in the initial phase and then painless. It can be the cause of erectile dysfunction item 126.\n*Cancer of the penis'': this is a squamous cell cancer, affecting adult men (> 50 years old). Favouring factors are pre-cancerous lesions (erythroplasia), lichen sclero-atrophic, HPV infections and lack of circumcision. It sits on the sheath of the penis or the foreskin. It may present as acquired phimosis or an indurated, ulcerated, painless, vegetating and progressive lesion of the penis. The 1st lymph node is inguinal.\n\n==''Urethral meatus anomalies''':==\n\n*'''<small>Urethral meatus stenosis:</small>''' In the vast majority of cases, it is secondary (repair of an abnormal meatus, circumcision). Congenital stenosis will be due to a channeling defect of the balanic urethra. In adults, it is secondary to chronic inflammation or scleratrophic lichen. It may be revealed by dysuria, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|chronic urinary retention (item 125)]) sometimes with renal failure, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urinary incontinence (125)]] (child), or [[Urinary infections in children and adults|urinary infections (161)]]. On examination the meatus is punctiform and fibrous.\n*<small>'''Hypospadias:'''</small> a hypospadias is defined by a urethral meatus which, instead of being located at the apex of the glans (navicular fossa), is located all along the course of the urethra, bulbar, penile or balanic (most common), on the ventral surface of the penis or on the perineum, behind the bursae. The foreskin is not closed ventrally and has the classic \"sapper's apron\" appearance. In a certain number of cases, hypospadia is associated with penile discolouration. This discolouration can only be observed during erection. Hypospadia is purely functional and aesthetic and does not lead to urinary signs or erectile dysfunction. Fertility is normal.\n*<small>'''Epispadias:'''</small> Epispadias is defined by the presence of the urethral meatus on the dorsal surface of the penis. This orifice may be located very proximally at the level of the bladder neck (penopubic or suprapubic, with bladder exstrophy) or more distally (penile) as far as the dorsal surface of the glans (balanic), which then takes the form of 2 hemiglands separated by a longitudinal groove open dorsally. The penis, which is of normal calibre, is short and curved towards the abdominal wall: a sort of dorsal curvature of the penis. They are associated with a spread of the pubis and rectus abdominis muscles to varying degrees. Epispadias may be observed in cases of bladder exstrophy. Urinary continence disorders and erectile dysfunction may occur in cases of associated anomalies of the penis.\n\n<br />",

Spermatic cord torsion is rare after the age of 40.\n*It causes irreversible arterial ischaemia of the testicle 6 hours after the onset of pain. It is a surgical emergency.\n*The risk is that the prognosis for testicular function is compromised by ischaemia and testicular necrosis. This risk is statistically correlated with the duration of the ischaemia: the later the detorsion with revascularisation, the greater the risk to the endocrine and exocrine functions of the gonad.\n*Nevertheless, torsion of the spermatic cord is a therapeutic emergency whatever the duration of ischaemia.\n*There is no room for further investigations. If there is any doubt, surgery should be performed. Testicular Doppler ultrasound can be falsely reassuring. It is mainly prescribed to eliminate differential diagnoses or in cases of suspected long-standing torsion (> 24 hours), but should never delay therapeutic management.\n*The external detorsion manoeuvre has a very limited role. Its aim is to relieve the patient and reduce the duration of acute ischaemia, without delaying surgical management. Even if it is successful (regression of pain), it does not dispense with urgent surgical exploration, as one or more turns of coil may still remain on the spermatic cord.\n\n==''Necrotizing fasciitis'' :==\n\n*Necrotizing fasciitis or perineal gas gangrene is an anaerobic infection of the subcutaneous spaces of the perineum. It may affect fragile patients (diabetes, chronic alcoholism, immunosuppression, etc.). There may be a portal of entry (anal margin abscess, urethral catheterisation), but this is inconstant. It progresses in 3 phases: inflammation, gas gangrene and skin necrosis. It is accompanied by a serious septic state.\n*Management of necrotising fasciitis is a vital medical and surgical emergency: excision/drainage, broad antibiotic therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, resuscitation. The prognosis is poor, with an estimated mortality rate of between 20 and 50%.\n\n==''Paraphimosis:'''==\n\n*Paraphimosis is a surgical emergency involving strangulation of the glans penis, leading to necrosis of the glans penis and sheath. Manual reduction with emergency recalibration is necessary.\n\n<br />",

The hernial orifices are free.\n*Positive transillumination helps in the diagnosis of a hydrocele since the application of a light source behind the scrotum allows light to pass through, unlike an inguinal hernia or a [[Testicular tumours|tumour (313)]].\n*In children, the hydrocele is due either to the persistence of the peritoneovaginal canal, in which case it is known as a communicating hydrocele, or, as in adults, to a reaction to an inflammatory, tumoral or traumatic phenomenon. In this case, it reflects a failure to resorb the liquid secreted by the vagina (known as a non-communicating hydrocele). The increase in volume is progressive.\n*In children, the communicating nature is suggested by the variations in volume during the day, the increase in symptoms when standing and the possibility of expelling the fluid by squeezing the bursa.\n*Sudden tension (often coinciding with a viral infection in children) may be painful, and the skin may be bluish. In this situation, the differential diagnosis of strangulated hernia or torsion of the spermatic cord may be raised.\n*In adults, it is common and is due to a defect in the resorption of fluid secreted by the vagina (non-communicating).\n*The clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a non-painful swelling suspended above and independent of the testicle.\n*Hydrocele or cord cyst are not emergencies.\n\n<br />",

The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders and cognitive disorders.\n\n'''The different origins of gait disorders:'''\n\n- Walking disorders of ''painful'' origin. The disorder observed is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific (exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease: muscular glycogenosis).\n\n- Walking disorders of ''ataxic'' origin. (i) cerebellar ataxia (static, kinetic and locomotor cerebellar syndrome), (ii) vestibular ataxia (vertigo, gait deviation, manoeuvres), (iii) proprioceptive ataxia (heeling gait, hypopallesthesia).\n\n- Gait disorders of \"central\" origin. Central motor deficit disorder: sequelae of a cerebrovascular accident, essentially in the form of hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.\n\n- Peripheral gait disorders. Motor disorders of peripheral origin: often predominant in the extremities (steppage), or muscular disorders whose deficient topography is often symmetrical and predominantly proximal, giving a waddling gait.\n\n- Gait disorder with ''gait with small steps''. Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.\n\n'''Other walking disorders:''''\n\n- Dystonia: (hyperkinetic motor disorder) pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, \"heron\" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, \"dromedary gait\" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.\n\n- Chorea: (hyperkinetic motor disorder)\n\n- Tremor (primary orthostatic tremor)\n\n- Trendelenburg lameness (instability with lowering of the pelvis on the non-weight-bearing side)",

This is a painful heaviness or heaviness which does not prevent the patient from continuing to walk, which does not subside rapidly when walking is stopped, and which subsides progressively when the patient is decubitus.\n\n===Evidence in favour of a venous origin===\n- Increased symptoms in the following situations:\n\n*during the day,\n*after prolonged standing or sitting,\n*heat (underfloor heating) or exposure to the sun,\n*during pregnancy, when taking oestroprogestins or during the premenstrual period;\n\n- '''improvement''' of symptoms in the following situations:\n\n*cold,\n*elevation of the lower limbs,\n*Decubitus,\n*physical exercise,\n*elastic venous compression (socks, stockings, bands).\n\n===Differential diagnoses ===\nOther symptoms, such as impatience, tingling and skin redness may be present but must be differentiated from two other less well-known diagnoses:\n\n*nocturnal impatience'' (imperious need to move the legs), which may be part of the \"restless legs syndrome\": the patient describes a sensation of numbness of the limb in a position of immobility, rapidly intolerable, forcing him to move;\n*burning and redness of the foot after a few hours' sleep, waking the patient and forcing him to seek contact with the cold (tiles, cold water), corresponding to ''colour abnormalities of the extremities SD-015|erythermalgia]''.\n\n== '''Cutaneous signs'''==\nTrophic cutaneous signs (''SDS-[[Cutaneous ulcer SD-092|cutaneous ulcer]]; SDS-[[Wound SD-170|wound]]; SDS-[[Vaccinations in adults and children SD-322|vaccinations in adults]]'') linked to the development of venous insufficiency and varicose veins are represented by:\n\n*varicosities or telangiectasias: these are dilations of small-calibre veins (< 3 mm). When they are located on the ankle or plantar arch, they are known as corona phlebectatica and are a warning sign of the onset of a venous ulcer in the long term,\n*varicose veins,\n*l'''''''[[Localised or diffuse oedema SD-054|oedema]] of the foot: it is white, soft, takes on a cup-like appearance, with a clear increase at night, without redistribution to other areas,\n*pigmented dermatitis: this is caused by the passage of red blood cells into the dermis, releasing their iron pigments. Ochre dermatitis is irreversible and usually begins on the inside and lower side of the leg,\n*Eczema of the lower third of the leg is also a frequent complication of chronic venous stasis. The lesions are erythemato-vesicular or scaly in the pathological venous territory,\n*Milian's white atrophy takes the form of small porcelain-white areas, mainly located on the malleolus. It is surrounded by ochre dermatitis or telangiectasia. It reflects a rarefaction of capillaries within fibrous tissue, and therefore the presence of genuine cutaneous ischaemia, heralding the onset of a venous ulcer,\n*stasis dermo-hypodermatitis (lipodermatosclerosis) is localised to the lower third of the leg, initially taking on an inflammatory appearance with skin redness and pain, then progressing in flare-ups. These lesions are associated with extravasation of polymorphonuclear cells. Progressive evolution leads to a sheathing fibrosis inducing a rigid gaiter (\"sclerotic hypodermitis\"). Ankylosis of the ankle further impairs venous return. The diagnosis of erysipelas is an important differential diagnosis of inflammatory stasis hypodermatitis,\n*Lymphatic stasis is the consequence of advanced CVI, which alters the lymphatic network. It leads to permanent infiltrated oedema and thickened, cardboard-like skin. Lymphatic stasis is often aggravated by recurrent local superinfections,\n*skin ulcer SD-092|venous ulcer.\n\n==''CEAP classification of DVI (\"C\" for clinical)'''==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | CEAP classification of CVI\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''C: for clinical signs (grade 0-6)'''\n\na for asymptomatic, s for symptomatic\n|-\n|0\n|no visible or palpable signs\n|-\n|1\n|Telangiectasias or reticular veins\n|-\n|2\n|Varicose veins\n|-\n|3\n|Edema\n|-\n|4\n|Trophic disorders: ochre dermatitis, eczema, hypodermatitis\n|-\n|5\n|Healed ulcer\n|-\n|6\n|Unhealed ulcer\n|}\n<br />",

Any phenomenon that reduces this will generate venous stasis, which is the cause of CVI. There are three main causes of venous return failure. The possible aetiologies are included in the CEAP classification of CVI (\"E\" for aetiology, see table).\n\n==Primary venous insufficiency ==\n\n===''Varicose disease or essential varicose veins or primary varicose veins'''===\nVaricose veins are defined as veins with pathological walls which become dilated and tortuous, with valvular incontinence. This is the most common aetiology. There are two types of varicose veins:\n\n*systemic varicose veins, which develop at the expense of the greater and lesser saphenous veins;\n*non-systematic varicose veins, known as non-saphenous varicose veins, which develop at the expense of perforating veins or pelvic veins.\n\n===''Primary deep valve insufficiency'''===\nPrimary deep valve insufficiency results from a defect in valvular continence or valvular dysgenesis of the deep veins which leads to deep venous reflux. It is a rare condition.\n\n== ''Secondary venous insufficiency'' ==\n\n=== ''Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)'' ===\nThe risk is particularly high in cases of iliofemoral thrombosis. It is estimated that 20-50% of deep vein thromboses will become complicated by PTS despite well-managed treatment (5-10% will develop severe PTS).\n\n===''Compressive venous syndromes'''===\nCockett's syndrome is due to compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. It can range from simple compression to thrombosis or complete left iliofemoral occlusion. Other chronic extrinsic venous compressions are mainly due to pelvic tumours. They are usually responsible for iliofemoral thrombosis.\n\n==Functional venous insufficiency ==\nThis term is currently reserved for venous return failure with morphologically normal veins. This situation may be linked to a reduction in walking ability, tibio-tarsal ankylosis, a loss of muscle volume, or an alteration in cardio-respiratory dynamics. It is frequently encountered in the elderly.\n\n==Other causes of venous insufficiency ==\nThese represent only a very small proportion of the causes of venous insufficiency. These are simple or complex venous malformations. The most common malformative syndrome is Klippel-Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome, which combines venous dysplasia, [[haemangiomas and cutaneous vascular malformations|capillary malformation]] and elongation/hypertrophy of the affected limb.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" | CEAP classification of CVI\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''E: for aetiological classification'''\n|-\n|C\n|Congenital\n|-\n|P\n|Primitive\n|-\n|S\n|Secondary\n|}\n<br />",

This pressure will naturally decrease from the ankle to the thigh due to the morphology of the limb. Its action involves a haemodynamic (venous trunks) and microcirculatory effect. It is most effective when applied in the morning, within an hour of getting up. Its application sometimes requires the use of devices to aid donning or the assistance of a third party.\n\nThere are 4 classes of elastic compression socks, stockings and tights, depending on the pressure exerted on the ankle (between 10 and 15 mmHg: class I; between 15.1 and 20 mmHg: class II; between 20.1 and 36 mmHg: class III; > 36 mmHg: class IV). The indications are summarised in the table below, which is based on the 2010 HAS recommendations. Functional CVI is an indication for class I compression. Lymphatic insufficiency is an indication for class IV compression.\n\nThe contraindications to elastic compression are: obliterative arterial disease with SPI < 0.60; septic venous thrombosis; phlegmatia caerulae; diabetic microangiopathy with TcPO2 < 30 mmHg.\n\nRegular reassessment of the benefit/risk ratio of compression is essential in cases of : OAMI with SPI between 0.60 and 0.90; advanced peripheral neuropathy; oozing or eczematous dermatosis; intolerance to the fibres used.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Clinical situation\n!Devices\n!Methods\n|-\n|Varicose veins > 3 mm\n| Socks, thigh-highs, pantyhose\n\n- Class II or III\n|Long-term\n|-\n|After sclerotherapy, heat treatment or stripping (varies according to team)\n| Lower thigh\n- Class II or III\n|4 to 6 weeks (varies according to team)\n|-\n|Chronic oedema of venous origin\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Long-term\n\nRegular re-evaluation\n\nthe benefit/risk ratio\n|-\n|Pigmentation, eczema\n\nvenous\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Lipodermatosclerosis,\n\nvenous hypodermatitis,\n\nwhite atrophy\n| - Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III\n|-\n|Healed ulcer\n| Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV\n|-\n|Open ulcer\n|<Multi-type bandages as first-line treatment</nowiki>.\n\n- Socks, thigh-highs, tights\n\n- Class III or IV (maximum tolerated)\n|Until healing\n\ncomplete\n|}\n\n==''Drug treatment'''==\nVenotonic drugs are only prescribed in cases of functional symptoms (discomfort, heaviness in the legs) and as an adjunct to a healthy lifestyle and elastic compression. They are prescribed sequentially for short periods.\n\n==Sclerotherapy, endovenous thermal techniques and surgery ==\nThese treatments are indicated for symptomatic varicose veins and aim to \"destroy\" the pathological veins. The indication must also take into account the patient's condition. In patients with cardiovascular risk factors or atheromatous disease (coronary artery disease, obliterative arterial disease, etc.), the venous capital should be preserved as far as possible so that it can be used for arterial bypass surgery at a later date, in the absence of major varicose veins. Varicose veins secondary to a post-thrombotic syndrome should generally be respected, as they can compensate for deep vein obstruction; treatment should be on a case-by-case basis if superficial venous insufficiency aggravates deep venous insufficiency.\n\nThe choice of technique depends on the location, appearance and diameter of the varicose veins.\n\n===''Sclerotherapy'''===\nSclerotherapy involves the percutaneous injection of a sclerosing agent (liquid or foam) into a varicose vein. The injection can be carried out under ultrasound control (= echosclerotherapy). It may be carried out alone or in conjunction with another technique.\n\nThe endothelial inflammation generated will lead to fibrous and retractile scarring of the treated vein.\n\nIt is widely indicated from CEAP stage C2 upwards.\n\nThe possible complications should not, however, lead to this treatment being trivialised (haematoma, sequelae of pigmentation and intra-arterial injection, which is particularly serious but exceptional). The benefit/risk balance must therefore be carefully assessed in mild forms of CVI, and patients must be given full information.\n\n===''Endovenous thermal techniques'''===\nEndovenous thermal techniques (laser or radiofrequency) have replaced traditional surgical techniques. When feasible, they are the first-line treatment when sclerotherapy is not indicated. They can be carried out without a general anaesthetic and allow patients to resume physical and professional activity as quickly as possible. It consists of destroying the venous wall using heat after an anaesthetic has been applied around the vein to be treated.\n\n===''Surgery'''===\nThe indications for surgery are becoming increasingly limited. The most common techniques are stripping and phlebectomy.\n\nStripping is indicated in extensive and tortuous forms and requires a general or loco-regional anaesthetic and time off work.\n\nPhlebectomies consist of removing segments of superficial varicose veins by micro-incisions in the skin under local anaesthetic. Phlebectomies can be performed in stages, respecting the saphenous trunk.\n\n==='''Crenotherapy or spa treatment'''===\nCrenotherapy may be proposed as an adjuvant treatment in certain targeted cases which remain symptomatic after medical or interventional treatment (CVI with significant skin repercussions, disabling post-thrombotic syndrome, disabling lymphoedema).",

It is accompanied by intense pruritus and manifests itself in the form of eczematous or urticarial lesions covered with tense bullae. Lesions are localised to the roots and flexural surfaces of the limbs; the head, neck and mucous membranes are spared. Biologically, there is a blood hypereosinophilia.\n\n\nPemphigus vulgaris affects people aged around 45 and manifests itself as painful erosions of the oral mucosa and other mucous membranes (genital, anal, nasal, conjunctival). Secondarily, there may be cutaneous bullae on non-inflammatory skin and a Nikolsky's sign. It may be drug-induced or associated with another autoimmune disease. In superficial pemphigus, there are no mucosal lesions but only squamous-crusty or even keratotic skin lesions.\n\nHistologically, a subepidermal bulla with an infiltrate of eosinophilic polynuclear cells is found in bullous pemphigoid, and an intraepidermal bulla with acantholysis (detachment of keratinocytes) in pemphigus vulgaris.\n\nIn direct immunofluorescence, there is a linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction in bullous pemphigoid and a deposition of IgG and C3 on the surface of keratinocytes in pemphigus (inter-cellular or mesh marking).\n\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence shows that circulating antibodies recognising the dermo-epidermal junction are present at high titre in bullous pemphigoid and circulating antibodies recognising the intercellular substance in pemphigus.\n\nIn ELISA, these circulating antibodies recognise the following target antigens: BP180 and BP230 proteins in bullous pemphigoid, desmoglein 3 in pemphigus vulgaris and desmoglein 1 in superficial pemphigus.",

The overall prevalence of the syndrome varies widely, ranging from 10% to 70% of post-menopausal women.\n\nThe diagnosis of MGS is mainly clinical; a single symptom being sufficient to describe this syndrome.\n<br />\n\n== Medium and long-term effects\n\n=== Postmenopausal osteoporosis ===\n\n==== Definition ====\nOsteoporosis is defined as a state of diffuse skeletal fragility linked to a reduction in mineral mass and alterations in bone microarchitecture, which may be complicated by fractures following minor trauma.\n\nThe most typical fractures are wrist fractures, vertebral compression and femoral neck fractures.\n\n==== Tissue consequences of the menopause ====\nEstrogen deficiency causes osteoclastic hyperactivity, leading to accelerated bone loss.\n\nThe risk of osteoporosis will depend on the woman's bone stock at the time of her menopause and the rate of post-menopausal bone loss.\n\n==== Screening women at risk ====\n- Measurement of bone capital at 2 reference sites (lumbar spine and upper end of femur) by ''osteodensitometry'' using the reference technique d''''absorptiometry biphotonique \u00e0 rayons X'' (DEXA)\n\nAny subject will be considered osteoporotic when his or her bone mineral density value is less than 2.5 standard deviations below the average for young adults (T-score < -2.5)''.\n\n- Other fracture risk factors, study of bone remodelling (markers).\n\n=== Cardiovascular disease ===\nEpidemiological data have clearly established that the onset of the menopause, whether natural or surgical, is associated with a loss of the advantage that women have over men with regard to cardiovascular disease. The disturbances underlying this risk are :\n\n    - metabolic disturbances affecting lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, insulin metabolism, fat mass distribution and haemostasis disturbances (table 5).\n\n   - ''direct alterations in the structure and reactivity of the vascular wall'', with estrogen deficiency reducing arterial vasoreactivity and promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.\n\n==== Screening women at risk ====\nIn practice, ''screening for cardiovascular risk'' is still based on the search for traditional risk factors, with the menopause constituting an additional risk factor. A number of so-called emerging risk factors specific to women also contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in women after the menopause (gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, migraines with aura, etc.).",

It is referred to as an \"attack\" when complaints are of short duration and include a painful component, or as a chronic disease when signs are regular. Symptoms are usually accompanied by a morphological change in the haemorrhoids, but there is no anatomo-clinical correlation (people can complain of small haemorrhoids, or have large haemorrhoids without feeling them). The pathogenesis of haemorrhoidal disease is only partially understood. There are two theories that lead to a normal, asymptomatic anatomical component becoming symptomatic: the mechanical theory and the vascular theory.\n\n- The mechanical theory is based on a weakening of the support tissue or anchoring material of the internal haemorrhoids: long bowel movements, straining (dyschesia), changes in stool consistency (hard stools) and childbirth are risk factors for the onset of haemorrhoidal signs. Many patients express the fact that the onset of signs of haemorrhoidal disease coincides with childbirth.\n\n- Vascular theory likens haemorrhoidal disease to venous insufficiency. However, haemorrhoids are not veins (they do not have congenital valves) and the red bleeding of a haemorrhoidal crisis is not venous. However, the increase in size of haemorrhoidal tissue at the end of pregnancy and the short-term effectiveness of so-called veinotonic treatments support this hypothesis.\n\nCf item ''[[2C-288-ET-B01]]''''",

Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation (cf [[Constipation in children and adults|item 283]]). Treating chronic constipation is therefore a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences and perhaps even complications.  Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fibre (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.\n\n==b) Medication:==\n'''Treatment of internal haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nDiosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms''. Local topicals include all ''emollient products'' for topical application (creams, ointments and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.\n\n'''Treatment of external haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nThe only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision (see below). However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are an alternative to incision/excision (see below). Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.\n\n==c) Principles of instrumental and surgical treatments\nThe term ''instrumental haemorrhoid treatment'' refers to all the procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, ''reinforce the supporting tissue and form a scar'' at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation) or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio, but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.\n\n\nSurgical haemorrhoid treatment'' is the term used to describe all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural or locoregional anaesthetic. There are \"two types of haemorrhoidal surgery\": \"those which remove\" the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and \"those which fix or tighten\" the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.\n\nThe treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, ''an incision or excision'' can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in ''relieving pain and shortening its course''. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see above).",

It is an a posteriori approach to risk. A risk has occurred resulting in harm to a patient. This harm may be real or perceived by the patient.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of errors and the reasons for complaints will enable us to identify ways of preventing further errors by implementing improvement measures.\n\n'''Basics of in-depth analysis of error causes'''\n\n'''Reason's model'''\n\nReason's model (or the Swiss cheese model) is the model most often presented. It has the advantage of drawing attention to the latent causes of an accident, distinguishing between active and latent errors.\n\nThis helps us to understand that human error is most often only a consequence of deeper organisational flaws. This model proposes an analysis of undesirable events in successive sequences in which the different levels of defence existing at each stage have been overcome. This concept of successive barriers has now been replaced by a systemic model, which is too complex to be detailed here.\n\n'''Safety barriers'''\n\nBarriers are in-depth defences (protections) against the risk of error. There are three types of safety barriers:\n\n- prevention barriers ;\n\n- recovery barriers ;\n\n- mitigation barriers.\n\nAn effective safety system must have all three. Neither recovery nor mitigation barriers should be neglected.\n\nThese three types of barriers can be :\n\n- intangible: laws and regulations, instructions, good safety practice, recommendations, procedures and protocols, training programmes, work organisation, etc. ;\n\n- material: physical coding (e.g. special design of medical gas and vacuum connection rings to prevent inappropriate connections of different colours).\n\n'''Prevention barriers'''\n\nThey are designed to prevent errors and accidents from occurring: for example, the surgical checklist, an intangible barrier that breaks down into three stages (Box 5.4), or computerised prescribing in a system that provides alerts based on dangerous doses, the patient's clinical and biological condition, drug interactions, etc.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Inset: Operating theatre checklist adapted from the HAS checklist grid, 2011 version''''\n|-\n|'''''Before anaesthetic induction'''''\n\n'''''Pause time before induction'''''\n\n- Verification of :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. procedure and surgical site (patient, records)\n\n. availability of clinical and paraclinical documentation\n\n. knowledge of the installation method, consistent with the site/intervention, not dangerous for the patient\n\n. skin preparation of the patient being operated on, documented in the department/operating theatre liaison sheet\n\n. equipment/materials required for the operation, with no malfunctions\n\n- Cross-check by the risk team :\n\n. allergic\n\n. inhalation\n\n. intubation difficulties\n\n. ventilation\n\n. bleeding\n\n'''Before surgery'''\n\n'''Pause time before incision'''\n\n- Ultimate\" cross-check within the team, in the presence of the surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s)/IADE, IBODE/IDE :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. planned intervention\n\n. surgical site\n\n. correct installation\n\n. availability of the necessary documents\n\n- Sharing information orally within the team on the elements at risk/critical stages of the intervention (time out) in terms of :\n\n. surgical\n\n. anaesthetic\n\n- In accordance with current protocols:\n\n. administration of antibiotic prophylaxis\n\n. preparation of the operating field\n\n'''After surgery'''\n\n'''Break before leaving the operating theatre'''\n\n- Oral confirmation by staff to the team:\n\n. of the recorded intervention\n\n. the correct final count of compresses, needles, instruments, etc.\n\n. labelling of samples, operating theatres, etc.\n\n. if any undesirable events or medical risks have occurred: report/notification\n\n- Prescriptions for immediate post-operative care are made jointly by the surgical and anaesthetic teams.\n\n\nN.B: IADE: state-qualified nurse anaesthetist; IBODE: state-qualified operating theatre nurse; IDE: state-qualified nurse.\n|}\n'''Recovery barriers''''\n\nThe mistake has been made but recovered before it has any consequences. For example, the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is the antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed before surgery, but the nurse reads about it in the medical record and alerts the prescriber, who changes the prescription.\n\n'''Mitigation barriers'''\n\nThe error has been made and has not been recovered. The aim is to limit the consequences for the patient. For example, a patient suffers cardiac arrest as a result of an error in the route of administration made by a nurse. She notifies the senior doctor as soon as she realises the error. The medical team is on site and starts cardiac massage while the SOS cardiac arrest team called in immediately arrives. The electric shock restored cardiac function, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilisation and monitoring. He was discharged the next day.\n\nRoot cause analysis\n\nThe root causes of a medical error should be sought in the overall context surrounding the undesirable event.\n\nThe analysis methods are structured to avoid oversights. The most commonly used methods are the ALARM method and the Orion\u00ae method. Root cause analysis methods generally include the following six steps for proper application:\n\n1/ Data collection: semi-structured interviews with all the people present at the time of the event, files, any other documents needed to understand the events;\n\n2/ reconstructing the chronology of the event;\n\n3/ Identifying deviations from recommended practices, without judging against an existing benchmark;\n\n4/ identification of contributing factors: immediate and deep or root causes (boxes 5.5)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Box: Typology of contributing factors or root causes (according to the ALARM method)''''\n|-\n|'''''Factors may be linked:'''''\n\n- the patient: state of health, seriousness of associated illnesses, communication difficulties (language, conflict with carers, etc.), vulnerability of certain patient populations (the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, children, adolescents, people with disabilities, the underprivileged, etc.);\n\n- the tasks to be carried out ;\n\n- to the team: communication within the team and with the patient in the therapeutic relationship, traceability of information in the patient file, supervision of junior staff undergoing training;\n\n- the working environment: physical (premises, equipment, supplies, etc.) or organisational (availability of qualified human resources, work organisation, working hours, etc.);\n\n- organisation and management: policies for replacing absent staff (no replacement, temporary staff, travel), continuous training, equipment management, etc;\n\n- the institutional context: national and regional public health policies, adverse event reporting systems, etc.\n|}\n5/ Proposed actions to be implemented (accompanied by an action plan) ;\n\n6/ drafting the analysis report.",

Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor (civil or criminal).\n\n'''Misconduct and disciplinary sanctions'''\n\nDisciplinary offences\n\nAny breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des M\u00e9decins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.\n\nThis Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des m\u00e9decins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.\n\nDisciplinary sanctions\n\nThe penalties incurred are a warning, a reprimand, a temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities, a temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years) or removal from the roll of the Ordre.\n\nTemporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.\n\n'''Implementation of disciplinary liability'''\n\n'''Jurisdictions'''\n\nThe competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.\n\n'''Referral'''\n\nReferrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by a departmental council of the Ordre, the national council of the Ordre, a doctor, a doctors' union, the director of the regional health agency, the prefect, the public prosecutor and the minister responsible for health.\n\nFor doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, the Conseil national de l'Ordre, the Director of the Regional Health Agency, the Prefect, the Public Prosecutor and the Minister for Health.\n\nA patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation.\n\nIf this fails, the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil r\u00e9gional de l'Ordre.\n\n'''Procedure'''\n\nThe patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague. Proceedings before the Order's courts are adversarial; the hearing is public.",

The management of errors and complaints; the therapeutic hazard\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Knowing the definition of criminal liability\n|Description=None\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Bastien Boussat\n|Order=2}}\n\nThe purpose of criminal liability is to punish individuals whose behaviour is reprehensible in our society. It is always personal, and applies equally to all doctors (including interns), regardless of the context in which they practise. It may also apply to health establishments in their capacity as legal entities.\n\nBehaviour that society defines as reprehensible is called an offence. These are listed in the French Penal Code and classified into three categories in order of seriousness: contraventions, d\u00e9lits and crimes.\n\n'''Infractions'''\n\nApart from certain specific provisions relating to non-compliance with conditions specific to certain healthcare activities (medically assisted procreation, biomedical research activities, etc.), the offences for which a doctor may be held responsible may also be committed by any citizen. However, doctors are more likely to commit certain offences than others. There are three main types of offence arising from the practice of medical care: those resulting from the breach of a duty of humanity, unintentional injury and manslaughter, and intentional injury and manslaughter.\n\n'''Violation of a duty of humanism'''\n\nThe violation of a duty of humanism mainly concerns 1/ the drafting of false certificates (article 441-7 of the French Penal Code), 2/ the violation of professional secrecy (article 226-13 of the French Penal Code) and 3/ failure to assist a person in danger (article 226-3 of the French Penal Code, box 5.1). It should be noted that failure to inform the patient does not constitute a criminal offence. It is, however, a potential cause of civil liability.\n\n'''Manslaughter and manslaughter'''\n\nManslaughter and unintentional injury cover the majority of offences for which a doctor is liable (articles 221-6, 222-19 and 222-20 of the French Penal Code). A patient's death or injury is presumed to be the result of a fault involving clumsiness, carelessness, inattention, negligence or failure to comply with a safety obligation. The doctor in question may have failed to comply with the best available scientific evidence or may have committed a \"trivial\" error in making a diagnosis, prescribing a treatment or carrying it out. For the offence to exist, the damage and the certain causal link with the fault must be established. The causal link can be either direct or indirect, provided that the fault committed is qualified, i.e. having created or contributed to creating the situation that contributed to the damage, or having failed to take the necessary measures to avoid it. There are two types of qualified fault:\n\n- deliberate fault: this is a breach of a specific duty of care or safety imposed by law or regulation. It requires a deliberate (i.e. conscious) breach of a rule of caution or safety.\n\n- Serious misconduct: this is recklessness, negligence or a breach of a duty of care or safety that exposes the patient to a particularly serious risk, of which the doctor cannot be unaware.\n\n'''Homicide and wilful bodily harm'''\n\nThese are still rare offences in the field of medical liability. They essentially boil down to the question of :\n\n- euthanasia ;\n\n- failure to obtain a patient's consent to a medical act ;\n\n- failure to comply with the conditions governing the lawfulness of certain medical procedures, which are governed by specific laws: termination of pregnancy, sterilisation for contraceptive purposes, removal of organs, human experimentation, etc.\n\n'''Implementation of criminal liability'''\n\n'''Lawsuits'''\n\nProsecutions are initiated by the public prosecutor, who decides what action to take on complaints, reports and police investigations. He or she may dismiss the case, refer the perpetrator directly to trial or request that a judicial investigation be opened.\n\nIf the case is not dismissed, the judicial investigation stage is the rule in medical matters, given the frequent complexity of the cases.\n\n'''Judgment'''\n\nMinor offences are tried by the police court and punishable by fines, misdemeanours by the criminal court and punishable by imprisonment, and felonies by the assize court and punishable by criminal imprisonment.\n\nThe offences of which doctors are accused are usually dealt with by the criminal courts, and are essentially offences punishable by imprisonment, which may be suspended, and fines.\n\nAt the same time as the criminal penalty is imposed, the patient who is the victim of the crime can claim compensation for the damage he has suffered, in the course of the same proceedings, by bringing a civil action.\n\n<br />",

It is based on not blaming the person who made the mistake. The natural tendency is to consider that the person responsible is the last in the chain of people involved in a care process. However, most of the time, the causes are multiple and often latent, undetectable at first glance.\n\nA non-blaming attitude, which must be shared by the head of the clinical department and hospital management, encourages the reporting of errors, their analysis and the implementation of improvement measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors. The opposite attitude means that errors are hidden. Failure to analyse them in depth creates second victims. A second victim can be defined as: \"a carer who is involved in and traumatised by an unforeseen and unfavourable event for a patient and/or a medical error for which he or she often feels personally responsible, leading to a feeling of failure and calling into question his or her clinical experience and fundamental skills\". The consequences can be serious, even leading to suicide when the carer, the last link in the chain, is personally implicated.\n\nDrawing up and complying with operating rules is one of the conditions for confidence in the healthcare risk management system. These rules can be set out in a charter, which specifies that reporting an error will not be penalised. Important elements of this charter include the following details:\n\n- objectivity is the rule. Reporting is based on facts that are not interpreted;\n\n- anonymity and confidentiality will be respected in the analysis that follows the reporting of the error or adverse event;\n\n- To be effective, reporting must be exhaustive, identifying all the risks associated with hospital activity and preventing them from recurring.\n\nSerious adverse events occurring in hospitals are usually identified using passive systems based on :\n\n- voluntary reporting by doctors and other healthcare professionals, even though the 2009 \"Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory\" law makes it compulsory;\n\n- the desire of patients, their families or close friends to explain the problems they have encountered or to obtain compensation for the harm they feel they have suffered.\n\nThis information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.\n\nThe third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces.

Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.\n\nWhen the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.\n\nThe classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:\n\n- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)\n\n- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)\n\n- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)\n\n- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in \"looking for associated lesions\": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",

Patients may claim that one of their rights has been infringed in order to hold a doctor or healthcare establishment liable. However, the onus is on the patient to prove fault. Article L.1142-1 of the French Public Health Code stipulates that health professionals and establishments are only liable for the harmful consequences of preventive, preventive or therapeutic acts if they are at fault.\n\n'''Patients' rights'''\n\nInfringement of one of these rights may give rise to medical liability for negligence:\n\n- right to health protection ;\n\n- right to respect for dignity ;\n\n- the right not to be discriminated against in access to prevention or care;\n\n- right to privacy and confidentiality of information ;\n\n- the right to receive the most appropriate treatment and care and to benefit from therapies whose effectiveness is recognised and which guarantee the best possible health safety and relief of suffering in the light of proven medical knowledge;\n\n- the right not to be subjected to acts of unreasonable obstinacy ;\n\n- the right to deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration in consciousness maintained until death ;\n\n- the right to receive treatment and care to relieve suffering ;\n\n- right of access to palliative care and support ;\n\n- the right to be informed about your state of health ;\n\n-the right to information on the costs to which the user may be exposed in the course of preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic activities;\n\n- the right to refuse or not to receive treatment\n\n\nThe event giving rise to liability must therefore be a proven fault. This fault can take different forms and is usually distinguished as follows:\n\n- technical negligence, which consists of a breach of established medical knowledge or scientific data. This proven medical knowledge constitutes a technical standard to which the judge refers, and may be defined by reference to scientific medical literature and recommendations of good practice. The judge must refer to proven medical knowledge at the time of the disputed medical act;\n\n- breach of a duty of humanism, which refers to the \"human\" dimension of medical practice, and may result in particular from a breach of professional secrecy or a lack of information that does not allow free and informed consent.\n\nIn some cases, the triggering event may take other forms: it may be the defect of a health product, the product being considered defective when it does not offer the safety that can legitimately be expected.",

The management of errors and complaints; the therapeutic hazard\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Knowing the definition of liability, penalties and compensation\n|Description=None\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Bastien Boussat\n|Order=1}}\n\nThe liability of a healthcare professional or institution may be sought for two purposes: either to penalise the professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare. The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance. In addition to providing compensation for victims, this insurance covers salaried doctors when the fault is detachable from the service or when the mission entrusted to them is exceeded.\n\nIn order to receive compensation for the harmful consequences of a medical act, a user must prove that the act caused the damage, that it gave rise to liability and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage.\n\nIn terms of the liability of healthcare professionals and establishments, damage can take several forms. It may be :\n\n- physical or mental injury;\n\n- loss of chance of survival or recovery;\n\n- a loss of opportunity to have escaped a risk that ultimately materialised (in the case of failure to provide information).\n\nThe damage must be present and certain. It may be future if it is certain (for example, the sterility of a child as a result of faulty irradiation).\n\nThe causal link between the event giving rise to liability (generally fault) and the damage must be certain. It need not be direct or exclusive.\n\nOf the three elements of liability, causation is usually the most difficult for patients to prove. It is often difficult to distinguish the consequences of the fault from those of the spontaneous evolution of the pathological state of health. The courts accept that compensation may be awarded for loss of chance of survival or recovery. In this case, compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability of survival or recovery lost as a result of the fault.\n\nThe same reasoning applies in the case of a failure to provide information. In this case, the patient has lost a chance to escape the risk that ultimately materialised. In other words, if they had been informed of the risk, they could have chosen to run it or to forego the medical procedure. Compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability that the patient would have had of foregoing the procedure if he had been informed of the risk. As a result, if the procedure was essential, the judge concludes that even if the patient had been informed of the risk, he would not have decided to undergo the procedure. The loss of chance is therefore zero.\n\nThe courts and the administrative courts also accept that a failure to provide information gives rise to a right to compensation for loss of preparation, as distinct from loss of opportunity. When the risk of which the patient was unaware actually materialises, this compensation compensates the patient for any inconvenience he or she may have suffered as a result of not being able to prepare for this eventuality, in particular by making certain personal arrangements.",

It is cosmopolitan, but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebosis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebosis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues (by vegetative forms of \"Entamoeba histolytica histolytica\").\n\n'''<u>Cryptosporidiosis</u>''''\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhoea, and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.\n\n'''<u>Giardiasis</u>''''\n\nGiardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhoea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.\n\n'''<u>Toxoplasmosis</u>''''\n\nToxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat faeces, and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases, and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",

These products can be just as dangerous or even fatal as fake medicines containing poisons or unauthorised products.\n\nExample: in 2012, in the United States, an anti-cancer drug Avastin\u00ae containing no active ingredients was found in 19 doctors' surgeries.\n\n====Insufficient quantity of active ingredient====\nUnderdosed, the drug cannot be effective.\n\nLong-term use of an under-dosed counterfeit product can also lead to drug resistance, particularly in the case of antibiotics or antiparasitic drugs (anti-malaria, anti-HIV or anti-tuberculosis treatments). This resistance, acquired during long-term use, can prevent the effectiveness of therapies against disease, creating an additional risk for public health.\n\nIn 2009, in Tanzania, a Metakelfin\u00ae antimalarial treatment containing insufficient active ingredient was discovered in 40 pharmacies across the country.\n\n====Excessive quantity of active ingredient====\nIn such cases, there is a risk that the patient will overdose and suffer adverse effects.\n\nExample: in 2009, in China, hypoglycaemic drugs containing 6 times the normal dose of glibenclamide led to the death of 2 patients and 9 others were hospitalised.\n\n=Risks associated with the composition of counterfeit products=\nIn some cases, the ''active ingredient'' may be ''replaced'' by corn starch, potato starch or saline solution.\n\nSometimes it is the presence of ''toxic substances'' that is found, which can be very serious for the patient, even leading to death. These are described below.\n\n#Heavy metals: mercury, lead, arsenic, aluminium, etc.: these products are carcinogenic and toxic to the central nervous system, kidneys and liver.\n#Real poisons\": rat poison, boric acid, antifreeze, etc.: \"toxic\" to the kidneys, causing kidney failure and developmental abnormalities. ''Example'': in Haiti (1995) and India (1998), a cough syrup containing paracetamol was prepared with diethylene glycol (a toxic chemical used as antifreeze) and caused a total of 89 deaths in both countries.\n#Common household products'': brick dust, chalk, paints, floor wax, etc.: used to improve the appearance of counterfeit medicines, they cause a wide range of adverse effects, from vomiting and dizziness to coma and even death.\n#Other and unwanted active ingredients'': silbutramine, haloperidol, etc.: all carry risks of varying degrees depending on their activity and dosage, such as breathing difficulties, muscle spasms, high blood pressure, strokes, etc. ''Example'': between 2000 and 2003, in the United States, aspirin was substituted for tablets of a neuroleptic (Zyprexa\u00ae).\n\n<br />",

Scientific integrity\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=21}}\n\n= Ethical principles of research involving humans (biomedical research) = RIPH (Research Involving Humans)\nResearch involving the human person (RIPH) is no longer referred to as biomedical research.\n\nRIPH is defined as research organised and carried out on human beings, which goes beyond the act of care and the immediate interest of the patient. It may be aimed at developing biological or medical knowledge, based on procedures that modify the usual, validated treatment.\n\nIts scope covers all tests and experiments on humans, whether they involve new drugs, new surgical techniques, new diagnostic methods that are invasive or carry a potential risk, or psychological or behavioural studies.\n\nA clinical trial is a scientific study carried out in human medical therapeutics to assess the safety and efficacy of a diagnostic method or treatment. It comprises a preclinical phase carried out in vitro and in vivo in animals, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in four phases.\n\n= I Principles and objectives of research ethics =\n\n\nThe aim is to apply fundamental ethical principles in the field of research. The principles can be implemented by means of normative texts, such as French laws and/or universal declarations, and by validation of protocols by a body such as the Committee for the Protection of Individuals.\n\nWe need to be vigilant about the quality of information and consent prior to any research, but also about the vulnerability of certain populations, safety conditions, monitoring throughout the experiment, after approval of the protocol, and marketing. The creation of patents for the purposes of industrial development must not lead to financial conflicts of interest or inequalities in access to healthcare.\n\nFor this reason, the principles that guide ethical research concern the methodology, objectives and conditions of the study, the collection of consent, vigilance towards a vulnerable population, the integrity of the publication of results and clinical management at the end of the study.\n\nThese principles are the principle of beneficence, the principle of non-maleficence, the principle of autonomy and the principle of justice.\n\n== A Principle of beneficence\nThis involves relieving or preventing physical or psychological pain, doing what is best for the patient (including sometimes doing nothing if the anticipated benefit is minimal), and carefully assessing the risk/benefit balance of the treatment envisaged.\n\n== B Principle of non-maleficence\nThe principle of non-maleficence consists of not causing harm through research, and immediately halting any research that has irreversible or significant harmful effects. In France, the Public Health Code clearly states that \"the interests of persons who undergo medical research always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society [...]\".\n\n== C Principle of autonomy\nThe principle of autonomy consists of allowing each person the capacity to think, decide and act freely, according to their own initiative, including decisions concerning their state of health. Subjects should be treated as autonomous persons'','' to protect those whose autonomy is diminished'','' to always seek to respect the wishes of the subject and to guarantee the quality of information and the gathering of consent.\n\nUnder French law, the human body is inviolable. It is therefore impossible to carry out treatment (which would be considered an attack on the human body) if the person has not given their consent to the treatment. To give consent, the person must have been informed beforehand. For consent to be valid, it must be free (without any hierarchical, family or other pressure) and informed, meaning that the information must be complete, fair and appropriate. It is also important to ensure that the information has been understood.\n\n== D Principle of justice (or equity) ==\nIn the face of declining and scarce economic resources, it is necessary to establish priorities in order to preserve equity in access to healthcare. This access must be identical, whatever the country in which the care is provided. Within a given country, health strategies and policies must take account of this principle to determine what will be prioritised: public health or individual health. In research, the selection of subjects must be fair, while protecting vulnerable populations. There should be no exclusion or discrimination on the grounds of the subject's religious, political or ethnic background.\n\n== E Universal nature\nEthical principles are universal in nature and transcend geographical, cultural, economic, legal and political boundaries. Conversely, their application procedure is not universal and depends on the laws or regulations in force in the country concerned. For example, the marketing of patents is prohibited in France but authorised in other countries, resulting in inequalities in access to care linked to these patents.\n\n= II The emergence of research ethics =\n\n\nSince ancient times, concern and respect for the patient have been at the heart of medical practice, and the Hippocratic oath, still taken today, bears witness to this.\n\nHowever, society's view of doctors has changed. Until the beginning of the 20th century, the predominant concern was to do what was best for the patient. The doctor, who was the \"knower\", the \"savant\", made the decision that he considered best suited to his patient's case. For their part, patients (or their relatives) placed all their trust in the doctor, who appeared to be in the best position to make the therapeutic decision. The principle of beneficence prevailed and medical paternalism was at its height.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, attitudes were changing. Technologies were developing in the scientific field. Proof of effectiveness was sought in the medical, police and industrial fields. The principle of beneficence gave way to the principle of autonomy. The collection of consent was seen as legitimising research. By the end of the Second World War, the abuses had become apparent and a regulatory framework was needed. The Nuremberg Code was introduced in 1947.\n\n= III Normative texts =\n\n== A Nuremberg Code (1947) ==\nDrafted by non-medical experts following the Nuremberg trials, the Nuremberg Code establishes an international code of ethics for experimentation on human beings. The code respects the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, in the sense that research must be of benefit to society. The balance of benefits and risks to the subject must be properly assessed. The Code respects the principle of autonomy, and the basic rule is the free and informed consent of the subject, which means that the investigator must provide reliable, clear and complete information before consent is obtained. The subject's freedom is unconditional and inalienable from the beginning to the end of the study, and he or she may withdraw from the study at any time if he or she so wishes.\n\n== B Declaration of Helsinki (1964)\nIssued by the World Medical Association, the Declaration of Helsinki takes up the fundamental principles already set out in the Nuremberg Code. It establishes a distinction between clinical and non-clinical research and research for the direct benefit of patients. It states that \"the interests of science or society must never take precedence over the well-being of the subject\".\n\n== C Manila Declaration (1981)\nIssued jointly by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Council for International Organisations of Medical Sciences, the Manila Declaration establishes the principle that the opinion of a committee of independent experts must be sought before consent can be obtained from vulnerable persons. This includes children, pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers and protected adults.\n\n== D European Directive of 4 April 2001\nThis directive incorporates the principles of the Helsinki and Manila declarations with regard to the protection of individuals. It also aims to harmonise European legislation on clinical trials on medicinal products with regard to research into the quality of trials, and to facilitate procedures and exchanges of information in the form of European databases.\n\n== E Revision of the Helsinki Declaration (2014) ==\nThis is the tenth revision of this declaration. It introduces public consultation as a working method, raises the issue of compensation for vulnerable populations and reiterates the post-study obligation to communicate overall and individual results.",

Ethics and prenatal diagnosis (PND) ==\nPrenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all \"medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero\". This activity is carried out under the supervision of the Agence de biom\u00e9decine, a public body created by the law of 6 August 2004.\n\nIts main tools are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis or cordocentesis). Faced with the fear that these techniques could be used to satisfy the desire for \"perfect\" children, ethical considerations led the legislator to introduce a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The text of the law as it stood on 6 August 2004 specified the purpose of PND: \"to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child\".\n\nThe application of advances in foetal imaging and human genetics to foetal medicine is highly questionable. Medical genetics initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, with the discovery in 1956 of the existence of a trisomy of chromosome 21 in the cells of patients suffering from the disease then known as \"mongolism\". Gradually, it became possible to harvest foetal cells from pregnant women using the amniocentesis technique. This marked the birth of prenatal diagnosis, first for trisomy 21 and then rapidly for a dozen other chromosomal anomalies. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis then expanded considerably, due in particular to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring of pregnancies, the appearance of biological techniques for analysing serum markers to assess the risk of trisomy 21 and molecular biology techniques.\n\nHowever, as progress in PND is much more rapid than that in therapy, recognising a disease often means realising that there is no treatment available to cure it, leading some couples to request termination of the pregnancy because of a disease that their future child will (perhaps) develop early, but also, in some cases, late after 30, 40 or 50 years.\n\nIt is then up to the CPDPN to interpret the meaning given in practice to \"a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis\" (Public Health Code).\n\nFrance is one of the few countries to authorise IMG \"at any time during pregnancy\" and the legislator, supported by the National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), has never wished to draw up a list of diseases giving access to IMG, in particular to avoid automatic decision-making (which would not take account of individual situations) and the stigmatisation of a group of people. Indeed, when faced with a request for an IMG, a CPDPN cannot exclude considering the context (the history, culture, representations and convictions of each of the parents), which may lead to different decisions from one couple to another, from one CPDPN to another, for the same pathology. The law therefore leaves a great deal to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and the expression \"particular seriousness\" may be interpreted in different ways by different families and teams. This freedom means that the experience, sensitivity and background of each couple can be taken into account in their decision.\n\nToday, the CPDPNs are faced with certain requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases for which prevention and/or treatment may or may not exist. One example is the case of foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene (which increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer) in families marked by numerous early deaths linked to these diseases. In these situations, requests for IMG have been deemed justified by the family history, which then becomes a criterion of \"particular seriousness\". However, some people question the legitimacy of certain requests.\n\nThe question underlying this whole debate is that of the criteria legitimising a medical decision to terminate a pregnancy. In the case of medical reasons relating to the preservation of the mother's life, there is little debate on this issue, as medicine gives priority to the person \"present\", in this case the mother. On the other hand, in the case of foetal impairment, the underlying issue is a serious one, and ties in with that of the acceptance of disability in our society. Some people, including medical practitioners, although not opposed to abortion, fear that society could slide into a situation where, because there are not enough facilities for the care of disabled children, parents would be encouraged, in an unspoken way, to resort more systematically to abortion. Another question, which is too often avoided by both medical and parental authorities, is: what quality of life can be guaranteed to people whose level of awareness and capacity for autonomy are sometimes difficult to assess?\n\nThe very terms of the law must therefore be questioned in the ethical process of deciding whether or not to terminate a pregnancy:\n\n   - High probability\": you don't have to be 100% sure that a child carrying the mutation will develop a serious disease. Some couples say they don't want to take the slightest risk. But isn't having a child already taking a risk? Others consider that a 25% risk, for example, is acceptable because it means that there is a 75% chance that their baby will be fine. So how we assess the notion of probability depends on each person and their history;\n\n   - incurability\": there may be diseases that are curable but \"disabling\", but behind this handicap, some people put variable notions ranging from \"acceptable\" to \"unbearable\". This involves an assessment of comfort and quality of life. Here again, incurability is a fairly subjective concept whose interpretation can vary from one individual to another;\n\n   - Particular seriousness\": the concept of seriousness also varies greatly from one person to another. What is a serious illness, and for whom? Who decides? Is it serious for the child, for his or her parents, for the doctor, for society? This question arises particularly in the case of diseases that cause intellectual impairment: systematic screening for trisomy 21 is a perfect illustration. When is an illness serious? At birth, in childhood, in adulthood or after the age of 50? How serious is a disease? When it affects a finger, a hand, the whole body, motor functions, cognitive functions? These questions illustrate the density and complexity of the discussions held within the CPDPN. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is necessary, as it is not only their perception of the seriousness of the disease that is at stake, but also their philosophy of life. This dialogue requires a great deal of time and energy on the part of multidisciplinary teams (doctor, geneticist, genetic counsellor, obstetrician, psychologist) whose main role is to support the couple as they work towards a decision.\n\n== B. The specific case of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) ==\nSince 2013, a new screening test for trisomy 21 has gradually come onto the market in France. This is the non-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT), which uses research and analysis of foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood. By simply taking a blood sample from the pregnant woman, this test makes it possible to detect trisomy 21 at a much earlier stage (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea - SA) and with a higher level of performance. The discovery of foetal DNA circulating freely in maternal plasma was described in 1997. Analysis of foetal DNA in maternal blood has already been used for many years in certain antenatal diagnostic indications, such as determining foetal sex in X-linked recessive diseases and genotyping foetal Rhesus D in Rhesus D-negative women. Until 2011, the quality of these techniques meant that they could not be reliably applied to the search for trisomy 21. Today, thanks to advances in new high-throughput sequencing techniques, the screening test for trisomy 21 based on analysis of free foetal DNA in maternal blood has a sensitivity of close to 99.9% and a specificity of 99.8% in high-risk populations.\n\nThis progress is revolutionising the practice of PND insofar as, in addition to trisomy 21, the technique is making it possible to study other characteristics of the foetal genome, with new indications and requests for prescriptions. Current debates are therefore focusing on the conditions of access to this test, not only for trisomy 21, but also for the search for other anomalies (search for risk markers potentially predictive of diseases such as cancers or other pathologies) or access to sex diagnosis.\n\nIt has been proposed that the implementation of the study of foetal DNA in maternal blood should be the subject of applied research, in the field of clinical practice, in order to gain a better understanding of the issues and perceptions of professionals and patients. The preferences of patients and professionals may differ, and the latter may be 'subjected' to the pressure of women's demands.\n\nWill the rules for prescribing these new tests be consensual? Won't the globalisation of access to healthcare and access to e-health via the Internet mean that women will carry out tests on their own, then come back to their doctors with the results and requests for treatment? It will therefore be necessary to assess these attitudes and changes and the nature of the requests, and probably to devise new frameworks and new rules. This will undoubtedly be one of the issues at stake in the forthcoming review of the bioethics laws.\n\nThere is also the question of the impact of this development of the DPNI on requests for terminations of pregnancy. The possibility of carrying out the DPNI test before the end of the first trimester raises a fundamental question: as this test can be carried out at an early stage, even before the first trimester ultrasound, the result can also be given to the patient very quickly, i.e. before the legal term for voluntary termination of pregnancy of 16 SA (weeks of amenorrhoea), potentially allowing direct access to an abortion based, in fact, on this biological result. This development may therefore call into question the spirit of French law, which historically sought to make a clear distinction between two situations: the first, abortion (within a time limit of 16 weeks' gestation) where the woman did not wish to have a child or was unable to welcome one at that point in her life (a situation then described as maternal distress, i.e. with a psycho-social component), and the second, IMG (termination for maternal and/or foetal medical reasons), with no time limit, but currently subject to prior agreement following expertise by a CPDPN reference centre. If the results of the DPNI are communicated to the woman before 16 weeks' gestation and she requests an abortion, the ethical framework of the decision changes completely. Some couples may be tempted to have an abortion, even when the risk of illness has been judged to be low by the doctors or the potential \"anomaly\" to be of little seriousness.\n\nAs far as healthcare professionals are concerned, the future status of the DPNI will undoubtedly need to be clarified so that women are aware of the place it will have in the pregnancy monitoring strategy. To date, some studies show that the number of professionals who do not wish to prescribe this new test at all is low, but that there is a real debate on the legitimate indications and questions associated with its use.\n\n== Key points\n   - PND (prenatal diagnosis) is the set of medical practices designed to detect a serious condition (genetic anomaly, chromosomal abnormality or malformation) in the embryo or foetus in utero, in order to give the future parents the choice of whether or not to terminate the pregnancy and to allow better medical management of the pathology if the pregnancy is continued.\n\n   - When a foetal anomaly is detected, it is up to the CPDPN (multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre) to certify that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition that is incurable at the time of diagnosis. If the pregnant woman so decides, this certificate enables her to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds.\n\nThe technique of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) would allow selection of foetal sex or access to genetic screening for markers of pathology or risk at an early stage in pregnancy. It is easy to understand why, while supporting the emergence of NIPT, it may be necessary to target the indications carefully and possibly discuss the timing of the return of results before or after the time limit for voluntary termination of pregnancy.",

Autonomy, presumed consent, anonymity, free of charge (or non-proprietary), restoration of the body, justice, role of the trusted support person, role of relatives.\n|Rubrique=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Ordre=23}}'''Ethical and legal principles of organ donation''''\n\nThe donation of organs (heart, kidney, liver, lungs, etc.) or other elements of the human body (blood, marrow, sperm, skin, corneas, etc.) is now an essential part of life-saving medical practice.\n\nThis is a major public health need, since around 5,000 transplants are carried out every year, but there is a large waiting list (13,000 needs per year, so 8,000 patients who have not been transplanted are waiting or at risk of death).\n\nAll doctors and healthcare professionals therefore have a central role to play in raising awareness among the public, patients and families.\n\nAccording to studies, public opinion has changed in recent years: 84% of French people are in favour of organ donation and agree that their organs should be removed in the event of their death.  There has been a real shift in public opinion on this subject. Agreeing to donate one's organs is now seen as a generous, altruistic gesture.\n\nThe Bioethics Laws have reinforced and developed the principles of the so-called Caillavet Law of 1976, the first law to establish organ donation in France. The current law is based on several principles:\n\n* Removal for scientific or therapeutic purposes ;\n* Respect for the human body: inviolable, not subject to property rights;\n* Rules governing consent;\n* Donation free of charge;\n* Anonymity between donor and recipient;\n* Diagnosis of death;\n* Health safety of samples of human body parts (screening for transmissible diseases);\n* The role of the Agence de la Biom\u00e9decine (ABM), which is responsible for managing the waiting list and allocating transplants.\n\n\n'''The principles of free and anonymous donation.'''\n\nThese principles are enshrined in French law.\n\nAs Jean Rostand pointed out in 1966, attacks on the corpse will only be tolerable if they are carried out with a generous and noble intention, with positive clinical, scientific or educational ends in mind.\n\nYet we live in a society where free services are not taken for granted. In a strictly utilitarian economic system such as ours, many things are based on an interpretation of value in terms of money, in a market system. What's more, more and more people have to pay to go to the beach, to walk along a river, to go to the toilet, sometimes to look at a landscape. In this de facto environment, there is a risk that all human activity will be subject to the laws of the market.\n\nMedical practice in France does not opt for the market. It chooses solidarity, based on the principle of universal access to healthcare for all, with respect for the principle of equality. What's more, we come from a philosophical tradition, stemming from the Enlightenment, which promoted the abolition of slavery, in other words the abolition of the commercialisation of people and bodies. In this way, free medical care makes it possible to prevent trafficking in human beings and organs. It also makes it possible to protect the weakest members of society, particularly in the case of living donors, so that they are not encouraged to live off the sale of their bodies. The same applies to the heirs of a deceased person, so that they cannot trade in their mortal remains.\n\nAnonymity and secrecy \"de facto\" reinforce the principle of gratuity, as they prevent any contact between the donor's environment and that of the recipient. It also allows families' lives to be respected and protected (avoiding abusive claims or thanks, delicate relationship problems between the families concerned, making it easier for the donor's family to mourn, etc.).\n\nThey also ensure respect for the privacy of recipients (respect for the convalescence of a person destined to live with an organ or tissue that is foreign to their own body).\n\nAs the philosopher J. Derrida has pointed out, giving does not imply any logic of reciprocity. According to Derrida, giving without expecting to receive is an altruistic concept of total gratuitousness.\n\n\n'''Concerning consent and the issues it raises.'''\n\nSince 1976, consent has been presumed for deceased donors (anyone who has not made known their refusal to donate organs or tissues during their lifetime is considered to have consented).\n\nHowever, it is now possible for deceased donors to express their refusal. This is done either through a national register of refusals, or through the testimony of relatives.\n\nAs far as the register is concerned, anyone aged 13 or over may register, without going through the intermediary of a third party. This refusal may be either to oppose samples being taken for therapeutic purposes, or for so-called scientific medical autopsy purposes, or for research purposes, but the opposition may not concern forensic autopsies (so as not to hinder the judicial process of seeking the truth). The register can also be used to specify the part or parts of the body that you do not wish to donate.\n\nThere is a special case for donations from deceased minors or adults under guardianship. In these cases, consent is obtained from the parents (each of the holders of parental authority) or the guardian.\n\nThe question of the testimony of the family and close relations was framed by a law of 7 August 2004, which specifies that the doctor must endeavour to find out from the trusted support person and close relations whether there is any opposition expressed by the deceased during his lifetime. The aim is therefore to bear witness to the wishes of the deceased, and not to formulate his opinion as a close relative. But in practice, isn't the dividing line sometimes complex?\n\nWhat's more, this often raises a question on a day-to-day basis: who should be given priority in the family or among close friends? What happens in the event of disagreement? What is the hierarchy? This is why the law encourages all citizens, including those in good health, to appoint a trusted support person to act as a witness. If there is a designated trusted support person, he or she takes precedence over any other relative. Lastly, although it is not mentioned in the law, it is important to note the importance of the patient's written consent and the fact that the patient should carry a signed donor card.\n\nThis delicate issue of consent by the deceased shows the major educational and psychological role that the coordination teams responsible for taking samples and for dialogue with next of kin must play.\n<br />",

At the same time, the user picks supplies from the second bin.\n\n==Dispensation==\nRisks may arise during :\n\n*analysing prescriptions (difficult or too quick to read), communicating information\n*galenic preparation\n*Delivering medicines to care units or directly to patients (storage methods, distractions, work interruptions).\n\nThe main errors inherent in this stage are: dose errors, errors of omission, drug errors (similarity of name, presentation, etc.) and galenic form errors.\n\n==Patient information==\nInforming the patient, who is involved in the care process, is an essential step in avoiding administration errors.\n\nA lack of communication between caregiver and patient can lead to a number of risks of confusion when patients self-administer their medication: dosage (units, drops, etc.), frequency, errors in administration technique, what to do in the event of adverse reactions, etc.\n\nInformation campaigns must be tailored to the specific situation of each patient (pathology, level of understanding, culture, lifestyle, etc.). They are carried out in a climate of trust and formulated in an understandable, clear and precise way. Those providing the information should ensure that it is understood by the patient (rephrasing, leaving time for questions) and those close to the patient, if present.\n\n==Administration==\nThe risks identified in connection with the administration of medicines are :\n\n*Errors in dosage, route of administration, form, timing, duration, error in administration technique\n*Omission of administration\n*Administration of out-of-date or degraded medication, unauthorised or unprescribed medication, product selection errors (anaesthetic trays, pre-prepared medication, medicine cabinet).\n*Failure to record administration, failure to pass on medication NOT TAKEN by the patient to the prescriber and pharmacist.\n*Errors in reading or interpreting labelling (frequent)\n*Incorrect identification and programming of administration devices.\n*Patient errors (e.g. double rooms in hospitals)\n*Incorrect preparation of weekly diaries.\n\nTo make administration more secure: do away with transcriptions, keep the identifying packaging until the last moment, ask for the patient's identity, inform the patient, etc.\n\nFinally, if you have any doubts about the drug, do not administer it.\n\n==Patient monitoring==\nTo reduce the risk of medication errors, it is particularly important to :\n\n*Know the elements of monitoring by treatment and approach.\n*Monitor clinical and biological parameters, and carry out pharmacological therapeutic monitoring where necessary.\n*Monitor the occurrence of adverse effects.",

Knowing the definition of unreasonable obstinacy and therapeutic prolongation, the need to respect the wishes of the patient, the need to work to relieve pain and suffering, sedation. Understand the concepts of limiting and stopping treatment. Distinguish between treatment and care. Know the definition of palliative care.\n|Rubrique=Management\n|Contributors=C\u00e9line Lef\u00e8ve\n|Ordre=18}}The L\u00e9onetti law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life and the Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law of 2 February 2016 aim to improve care for patients at the end of life. The issue here for medicine is not to initiate or prolong active therapies, but to know how to withdraw in order to maintain only so-called palliative care, which can go as far as deep and continuous sedation until death. These laws have thus provided a framework for the possibility (at the request of the patient or next of kin) or even the obligation (for the doctor, and in dialogue with the patient or family) to stop medical treatments that are disproportionate or only contribute to maintaining vital functions, while maintaining care that preserves the patient's dignity.\n\nThese laws are part of a profound social and legal movement dating from the 1970s-1980s aimed at promoting patient autonomy and, in particular, giving patients the means to communicate their wishes regarding the end of life. This movement can be explained by advances in medical technology, which now make it possible to prolong life long after patients have lost the ability to express themselves. Artificial respiration, nutrition and circulation can be provided before or during the end of life. Around 70% of the French population die in hospital.\n\n# The right to support at the end of one's life and to refuse unreasonable obstinacy\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law states that everyone has the right to ''access to palliative care and support at the end of life'': ''Everyone has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible relief of suffering. Healthcare professionals will do everything in their power to ensure that this right is respected. \"Everyone has the right to receive treatment and care designed to relieve their suffering. In all circumstances, this suffering must be prevented, taken into account, assessed and treated.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law reaffirms \"the patient's right to refuse or interrupt treatment\" or an investigation and prescribes the continuation of his or her follow-up, in particular palliative care. \"If, by refusing or interrupting treatment, the patient's life is endangered, he or she must reiterate this decision within a reasonable time. They may call on another member of the medical profession. It imposes an obligation on the doctor to respect the person's wishes, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness, to refuse or not to receive treatment.\n\nThe 2016 law enshrines '''the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy'''<nowiki>: \"When they appear unnecessary, disproportionate or when they have no effect other than the sole artificial maintenance of life, [treatment] may be suspended or not be undertaken, in accordance with the patient's wishes and, if the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation.\"</nowiki>\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: ''limiting care'' and ''stopping care''. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy. In the case of limitation, the aim is to refrain from implementing measures likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. It means not undertaking certain prolongation treatments that are technically possible, but without the aim of improving the patient's condition. Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment involves the suspension of vital treatment in progress, such as artificial respiration.\n\nThe 2016 law confirmed that artificial nutrition and hydration should be considered as \"treatments\" like any others, and may be suspended provided that the patient has, either directly or indirectly (via advance directives, for example), expressed his or her wish not to continue them. If this is the case, patients should be reassured that they will be comfortable and will not feel thirsty (thanks to the vigilance of the care teams, who will offer regular mouth care) or hungry.\n\nFor people who are not capable of expressing themselves, no decision to limit treatment may be taken by the doctor without first convening a collegial procedure, the aim of which will be to ascertain the patient's wishes as they may have expressed them previously. This procedure requires a meeting to be held within the healthcare department with all the healthcare professionals familiar with the situation. A second medical opinion must also be given during this collegial procedure. Next, the doctor in charge of the patient must consult the patient's advance directives, or, failing that, the trusted support person and, failing that, the family or close friends. Finally, it is the doctor in charge of the patient who will decide whether or not to stop treatment, having been informed of the patient's wishes.\n\n# The right to deep and continuous sedation\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law affirms the right to benefit from ''deep and continuous sedation until death when the vital prognosis is engaged in the short term'': ''At the patient's request to avoid all suffering and not to undergo unreasonable obstinacy, deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration of consciousness maintained until death, associated with analgesia and the cessation of all life-sustaining treatments'' is possible in cases that the legislator specifies: \"1\u00b0 When a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease whose vital prognosis is at risk in the short term is suffering in a way that is refractory to treatment; 2\u00b0 When the decision of a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease to stop treatment is at risk in the short term and is likely to cause unbearable suffering. When the patient is unable to express his or her wishes and, as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy referred to in Article L. 1110-5-1, in the event that the doctor stops life-sustaining treatment, the doctor shall apply deep and continuous sedation causing altered consciousness that is maintained until death, combined with analgesia\".\n\nA refractory symptom is defined as one which is unbearably perceptible and which cannot be relieved despite obstinate efforts to find a suitable therapeutic protocol without compromising the patient's consciousness.\n\nDeep and continuous sedation is based on the \"double effect argument\": \"The physician implements all analgesic and sedative treatments to respond to the refractory suffering of the patient in an advanced or terminal phase, even if they may have the effect of shortening life\". To clarify the distinction between acting and refraining from acting, and between acting and ceasing to act, we can refer to the intentions of the agent: the intention to cause death, which constitutes \"active\" euthanasia, differs from the intention of the person who refrains from continuing a treatment deemed unnecessary or harmful, and therefore excessive, a situation of unreasonable, disproportionate obstinacy, known as \"therapeutic overkill\", and condemned by the principle of non-maleficence. This distinction means that the term \"euthanasia\" is reserved for the \"active\", full, deliberate intention to end a life, an act that is criminal according to the law and reprobated by traditional medical ethics, which are still upheld by medical institutions and authorities. And room is made for the possible legitimacy, in certain circumstances, of an act which, even if it shortens life, no longer fights against an inescapable death and aims \"first and foremost\" to relieve suffering, and will no longer be qualified as euthanasia for this reason.  The main justification for drawing a line between euthanasia and non-euthanasia is to distinguish the intended effect of an act from its foreseeable but unintended side-effects. This is the \"double effect\" argument that inspired the 2005 law on the end of life, revised in 2016. According to this argument, the undesirable, \"bad\" consequences of an action that is considered to be primarily \"good\" do not necessarily prevent that action from being taken. For example, it is possible to relieve the suffering of an incurable patient at the end of life, even if the intensive administration of painkillers hastened the patient's death. The spirit of the principle of double effect is to say that while we can never will evil, even for the sake of a good, we can nevertheless will a good even if the result is evil, when the aim of this good is deemed to take priority. The aim of the primary good is imposed despite the evil that will be its effect. The advantage is to get out of a moral conflict between opposing duties: to relieve suffering, to protect life. In this way, we can say that there is no such thing as \"euthanasia\" because the desire is in no way to cause death, but to relieve a sick person in a proportionate way. Death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid suffering in the final moments. Monotheistic religions therefore accept the relief of suffering at the end of life, even if life is shortened. Thanks to the double effect argument, the principle of respect for life can be made more flexible and become compatible with a concern for quality of life.\n\n# Respecting the wishes of people at the end of their lives\n\nThe option for patients to write down their advance directives, i.e. their wishes regarding \"the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures\", has existed since the 2005 law. The main new feature of the 2016 law is that it is now binding.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law provides for \"advance directives and the designation of a trusted support person\" to enable people who are no longer able to express their wishes to have their rights recognised. Advance directives become the preferred expression of the wishes of patients who are no longer able to express themselves. \"Any person of legal age may draw up advance directives in the event that they are one day unable to express their wishes. These advance directives express the wishes of the person in relation to the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures. \"They may be revised and revoked at any time and by any means.\n\nAdvance directives are now ''binding'' on doctors. \"When a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is unable to express his wishes, the doctor is obliged to enquire about the expression of the patient's wishes. In the absence of the advance directives referred to in article L. 1111-11, the doctor shall obtain the testimony of the trusted support person or, failing this, any other testimony from the family or close friends\". \"Advance directives are binding on the doctor for any decision to carry out an investigation, intervention or treatment, except in the event of a life-threatening emergency, for the time necessary for a full assessment of the situation, and when the advance directives appear manifestly inappropriate or not in keeping with the medical situation\". Some people, including palliative care professionals, stress the variability of wishes and, consequently, the difficulty of interpreting and applying advance directives drawn up in previous circumstances that are far removed from the current end-of-life situation. \"The decision to refuse to apply advance directives that the doctor deems to be manifestly inappropriate or inconsistent with the patient's medical situation is taken at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation and is recorded in the medical record. It is brought to the attention of the trusted support person designated by the patient or, failing that, to the attention of the family or close friends.\n\nThe \"trusted support person\" \"may be a relative, a close friend or the doctor treating the patient\". \"His/her testimony prevails over any other testimony. This designation is made in writing and co-signed by the designated person. It may be reviewed and revoked at any time.\n\nConclusion. Fortunately, the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy limits the will to power that can arise from the implementation of treatments to prolong the life of a person at the end of life, at the cost of objectification, physical and/or moral suffering and disregard for that person's (previous or current) wishes. The right given to people at the end of their lives to ensure that their wishes are respected by means of advance directives rightly reinforces the limits to this abuse.\n\nHowever, the end of life calls for anticipation as much as it resists it. Paradoxically, it is marked by a fear of the future, synonymous with death, and yet by the impossibility of not projecting oneself into the next day, or even the next moment, in the hope of living it as serenely and intensely as possible. From then on, care at the end of life consists of offering, through attentive and solicitous relationships, adaptive, day-to-day support aimed at living in the present, without succumbing to the vain temptation to control the future.\n\n\n''References:''\n\nVan Lander, A.

The law does not specify what is covered by the terms \"particularly serious condition recognised as incurable\" and does not draw up a list, which again is impossible to predict.\n\nAcceptance of the woman's request is conditional on the opinion (validation) of the request by a multidisciplinary collegiate procedure. In practice, this procedure is carried out within a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre (CPDPN).\n\nWhen an abortion is considered on the grounds that continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health, the multidisciplinary team is made up of at least four people:\n\n* a doctor qualified in gynaecology-obstetrics, member of a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre;\n* a practitioner specialising in the condition from which the woman suffers;\n* a doctor chosen by the woman;\n* a qualified person who may be a social worker or psychologist.\n\nThe doctor qualified in obstetrics and gynaecology and the doctor qualified in the treatment of the woman's condition must work in a health establishment.\n\nThe law also specifies that when termination of pregnancy is envisaged on the grounds that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis, the multidisciplinary team responsible for examining the woman's request is that of a CPDPN. When the team from the aforementioned centre meets, a doctor chosen by the woman may, at her request, be involved in the consultation. Unless it is a medical emergency, the woman is offered a period of reflection of at least one week before deciding whether to terminate or continue her pregnancy.\n\nAt the end of the meeting, two doctors who are members of the multidisciplinary team certify that the multidisciplinary opinion has been given and that the request complies with the law. In both cases, prior to the meeting of the competent multidisciplinary team, the woman concerned or the couple is informed and may, at her request, be heard by all or some of the members of the said team.\n\nThree differences between IVG and IMG :\n\n* Termination of pregnancy for medical reasons can only be carried out by a doctor;\n* There is no time limit for termination of pregnancy: it can take place at any time during the pregnancy;\n* The principles for obtaining the woman's request and consent are the same as for abortion, but the CPDPN is responsible for accepting the request for an abortion, following a rigorous procedure.",

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation centre (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, \"15\", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.\n\n\n'''Emergency call management:''' The call is initially taken by a '''medical regulation assistant''' (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a \"medical regulator (MR)\" who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the \"need for care and commit the necessary resources\": this is \"act I\" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognised by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an \"advisory role\", advising a witness or the patient him/herself on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources: this assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest, for example. The rest of the intervention (\"act II\" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs in order to organise the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.\n\n'''Link to item 17''' Telemedicine, telehealth and telehealth services.\n\n\n'''Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de R\u00e9animation (SMUR)''': The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to '''take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital'', of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu.

Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalised around the ''reception organising nurse'' (IOA). The ED is generally organised into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a paediatric care unit. There is usually also a \"short\" rapid care pathway and a \"long\" pathway (patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalisation).",

This complexity and uncertainty make it difficult to provide information that will enable us to define \"the time that remains\".\n\n- The ethical challenge when it comes to informing patients is to provide honest and clear information, in line with respect for patients' autonomy and their right to be informed about their state of health, as set out in the Kouchner Act of 4 March 2002, by creating the conditions for building a relationship of trust: by being attentive to the person's needs and emotional reactions, by allowing them to express themselves and by taking the time to answer their questions and expectations, by assuring them that healthcare professionals will support them all the way and by laying the foundations for future care.\n\n- Respect for the dignity of the individual as a human being (Kant) - whatever their vulnerability, state of weakness, dependence, ability to express themselves, etc. - and recognition of the common humanity shared by carers and cared for. - and the recognition of the common humanity shared by carers and cared for.\n\n- The relief, in accordance with the principle of beneficence, of a person's pain and suffering. While the two concepts can be distinguished for the purposes of analysis (the term pain can be reserved for affects felt in particular organs of the body or in the body as a whole, and the term suffering for affects that are open to reflexivity, language, the relationship with oneself, with others and to questioning), the two phenomena do interpenetrate, as pain can completely invade subjective experience and affect the relationship with oneself and with others, as well as the person's ability to think, to say and to act (Ricoeur).\n\n- Respect for the person's autonomy, including when they are unable to express themselves. This respect means trying to find out about the person's history, personal identity and, in particular, their own values or preferences, what is important to them and what defines them (which is essential, for example, in deciding where the end of life will take place - at home, in hospital, in a healthcare establishment). This respect for the individual's wishes is reflected in the 2016 Clayes-L\u00e9onetti Act, which requires medical decisions to be made in accordance with the individual's advance directives and the testimony of the trusted support person, or failing that, the person's close relatives.\n\n- Maintaining the person's status as a subject. This involves maintaining the person's involvement in personal relationships, offering relational support to enable them to develop the meaning they need for the end-of-life ordeal and, more broadly, for their existence, and maintaining their self-esteem.\n\n- The issue of respecting the autonomy of people at the end of their lives raises the question of how to take into account their possible request for death and the methods that society defines as acceptable for responding to it. While the demand for death varies according to the stage of the illness, the intensity of pain and suffering and the quality of treatment and care, it can also be ambivalent and in reality mean a demand for presence and care, and it can also persist. Should care at the end of life be limited to accompanying the dying process by relieving the person's suffering through the massive administration of analgesics, even if this means accelerating the moment of death but without intending to bring it about (according to the double effect argument whereby death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid the suffering of the last moments)? Can it consist of providing a person at the end of life, whose suffering cannot be relieved and who expressly and persistently asks to be helped to die, with the means to take his or her own life (assisted suicide)? Or can care consist of actively and deliberately causing death (euthanasia) in response to a person's request?\n\n- The question of the decision-making process, which requires the implementation of an ethics of discussion during collegial and interdisciplinary deliberations. According to the philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas, decisions can be considered morally valid if they are the result of a discussion, i.e. an exchange of arguments that seeks agreement. However, reaching a consensus is no guarantee of the morality of the decision. What is important is that the discussion takes place in such a way as to give meaning to the decisions taken. It is also important that the decision-making process does not aim to apply general rules, but is based on the uniqueness and complexity of the situation.\n\n- The question of equity, i.e. access to appropriate care, in particular palliative care, taking into account the multiple inequalities that can affect people at the end of life (social, cultural, territorial inequalities, linked to their pathology, etc.).\n<br />\n\nReferences:\n\nC.

Historically, a living donor had to be the father or mother of the recipient, if possible. However, since 2004, donors may include spouses, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandparents, uncles and aunts, first cousins, as well as the spouse of the father or mother (blended couples). The donor may also be anyone who can prove that they have lived with the recipient for at least two years. It goes without saying that compatibility between donors and recipients must be reliable. In this way, the law keeps pace with changes in society and in medical and social demand.\n\nThe law also provides for the possibility of cross-donation. Cross organ donation involving living donors can take place in a \"chain\" between individuals.  In this way, a patient A can bring a donor B (who is not compatible with A); but this donor B will be used by a patient C who will bring a donor D who will be compatible with patient A.\n\nIn other words, we favour a donation chain between living donors and recipients.\n\nThere is therefore a requirement for considerable coordination and simultaneity between the removal and transplant operations, which means that 4 operating theatres have to be mobilised at the same time for 4 people, for example.\n\nThe law now allows the chain to be extended beyond two 'pairs'.\n\nConsent from living donors must be explicit, free and informed. It is based on a highly codified procedure:\n\n* Information on risks from the doctor: complete, including information on rare and exceptional risks;\n* Reflection period;\n* Opinion of an independent committee of experts, with the subject again being informed by this committee of experts and the freedom to consent assessed;\n* Consent formulated and subsequently recorded before a magistrate (President of the Judicial Court) + intervention of the guardianship judge for protected adults (for whom only marrow donation is authorised).\n\nIt should be noted, however, that donation is prohibited in the case of living donors who are minors or under guardianship or curatorship, with the exception of marrow. In this case, the consent of the parents (holders of parental authority) or legal representative is required, as described above.\n<br />",

While the profession, represented in this case by the Ordre National des M\u00e9decins, is responsible for drafting it, the resulting text is submitted to the administration, the Conseil d'Etat and finally the government, each of which is responsible for checking that it complies with the laws and other regulations governing the society in which doctors practise, and may make amendments. Finally, the code is published in the Journal Officiel under the signature of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Code of Ethics sets out the regulatory provisions governing professional practice. They are subordinate to other more important texts, in particular the Constitution and laws; they must be compatible with other decrees and require other texts of lesser scope, in particular decrees. Like other citizens, doctors are subject to the law - regarding respect for life or professional secrecy, for example - but the smooth running of their professional body is promoted by rules of their own.\n\n* See the text of the code of ethics for doctors <nowiki>https://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/code-deontologie</nowiki>",

To understand the definition and role of the trusted support person.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=\n|Order=20}}\n\n== I- Evolution of the rule of law and the law on the end of life ==\nTo understand what is at stake and how the end of life is dealt with, we need to know how society's view of the issue has evolved, as reflected in changes in the law.\n\n* The circular of 26 August 1986: the \"Laroque\" circular, relating to the organisation of care and support for terminally ill patients, defined palliative care for the first time in France, which it called \"support care\", as \"aimed at meeting the specific needs of people who have reached the end of their lives\";\n\n* <nowiki>The law of 9 June 1999 aimed at guaranteeing the right of access to palliative care: it opens up the right to palliative care and support to \"any sick person whose condition so requires\". Article 1 defines palliative care as \"active and continuous care provided by an interdisciplinary team in an institution or at home, [which] aims to relieve pain, alleviate physical suffering, safeguard the dignity of the sick person and support those around them\".\n\n* The law of 4 March 2002, known as the \"Kouchner law\", on patients' rights, places the individual at the centre of the decision-making process concerning him or her. The law stipulates that \"all persons, together with their healthcare professional and taking into account the information and recommendations provided by the latter, make decisions concerning their health\" and specifies that \"no medical procedure or treatment may be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person concerned\". Doctors are also obliged to inform patients about their state of health, treatments and their possible consequences. This law also introduces the possibility of appointing a \"trusted support person\", who must be consulted if the patient is unable to express his or her opinion.\n\n* The law of 22 April 2005, known as the \"L\u00e9onetti law\", relating to patients' rights and the end of life, reaffirms the right of every person \"to refuse or not to receive treatment\" or not to refuse unreasonable obstinacy. It recognises the possibility for doctors, in the name of the same principle, to limit or stop care and/or to apply a treatment that may have the secondary effect of shortening life, if they \"establish that they cannot relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease\" (this is known as the double effect), provided that they inform the patient, the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, one of the next of kin. It gives these people the right to request that their treatment be limited or stopped, and obliges doctors to respect their wishes \"after informing them of the consequences of their choice\". It states that any person of legal age may \"draw up advance directives in the event that he or she should one day be unable to express his or her wishes\", which \"indicate the person's wishes regarding the conditions for limiting or stopping treatment at the end of his or her life\". The doctor must take these into account when making any decision \"provided that they were drawn up less than three years before the person became unconscious\".\n\n* The law of 2 February 2016, known as the \"Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law\", creates new rights for patients and people at the end of life. If the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, the law requires the doctor to \"ascertain the patient's expressed wishes\" (art. 10), in particular through the use of advance directives and the trusted support person where these exist.\tIt introduces the right to \"deep and continuous sedation\" for a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease, when \"their vital prognosis is at risk in the short term [and they] are experiencing suffering that is refractory to treatment\", or when their decision to stop treatment \"involves their vital prognosis in the short term and is likely to result in unbearable suffering\". Deep and continuous sedation is the name given to the care process that consists of using medication to relieve pain. It involves a reduction or loss of the patient's consciousness. Under this law, euthanasia and assisted suicide remain prohibited in France.\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n* Limitation means refraining from using means likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. This means not undertaking certain life-prolonging treatments which are technically possible but which do not aim to improve the patient's condition;\n* Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment: this is the suspension of life-sustaining treatment in progress, for example artificial respiration.\n\nIn all cases, the issue of information and consent is central. A decision may or may not be taken at the patient's request, and it is essential to know the patient's feelings and last wishes. Two situations must be distinguished and discussed:\n\n* When the patient has made a request or is able to take part in the discussion with the team;\n* When the patient has not expressed anything, or can no longer express anything, and the request comes from relatives (questioning the patient's wishes and challenging the concept of autonomy).\n\nWhen patients are unconscious or have reduced capacity for expression and comprehension, incorporating the patient's opinion and consent into decision-making is highly problematic. There are several possible approaches:\n\n* Advance directives are a way for mentally competent people, who have lost their capacity to express themselves, to establish in advance and in writing how they would like to be treated in the event of hospitalisation. Among other things, they can concern end-of-life decisions, meaning that the person can specify the type of decision they would like to be made. But it is still rare for patients to write one;\n* The testimony of relatives or the trusted support person: this testimony is necessary, but it raises questions (which relatives? how reliable? how hierarchical are these relatives?).\n\nIn all cases, by law and in accordance with good professional practice, healthcare professionals have a duty to act collegially. The limitation or cessation of treatment cannot be carried out unless a collegial procedure has been followed between professionals and the patient's advance directives have been taken into account (if they exist) or the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, a close relative has been consulted.\n\nEach stage of the reasoned decision to limit or stop treatment must be recorded in the medical record.\n\n== II- Place and role of the trusted support person at the end of life ==\nIn addition to optimising the patient's right to information, other rights have led to the introduction of new practices to improve the relationship between carers and patients.\n\nThe right to appoint a trusted support person was enshrined in the French Public Health Code following the law of 4 March 2002.\n\nFor a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the \"trusted support person\" in the \"health democracy\" law of 4 March 2002.\n\nThe role of the trusted support person, in its original sense, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically and to act as a link with the medical teams. In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.\n\nThis primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still only perceived as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person has to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is to provide support during the course of standard care.\n\n== III- Drawing up end-of-life advance directives ==\nThe law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life introduced the possibility of refusing care if it appears to be \"useless, disproportionate or having no effect other than the artificial maintenance of life\". This refusal takes the form of stopping or limiting curative or palliative care, resulting in the patient's death in the more or less short term. This approach, authorised by law, has been described as a \"right to die\". Law no. 2016-87 of 2 February 2016, known as the \"end of life\" law, is a development of the 2005 law and strengthens the rights of patients at the end of life, and specifies the important role that advance directives can play.\n\nIn an end-of-life situation, in ethical terms, the decisive factor is the patient's degree of autonomy of thought, which is the true criterion for qualifying his or her ability to develop a coherent and considered argument in the face of such a decision.\n\nIn practice, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1) If the patient is aware and capable of taking part in a deliberative process, supported by the acquisition of sufficient knowledge about their illness and how it is progressing (transmitted by the doctor), they will be involved in this decision. The doctor and patient then engage in a complex and intimate exchange in which the patient expresses his inability to fight any further and his wish not to prolong his life. In this way, a dialogue can be established which, over time, can confirm the legitimacy and reality of a request to end life. The doctor can then act on the request, following in-depth discussion and reflection with the patient.\n\n2) For patients who are unable to express their wishes, there is a broad consensus on the importance of seeking their opinion so that it can be included in the decision. This is why the 2005 law states that \"when a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, the doctor may decide to limit or stop treatment that is useless or incapable of improving the patient's condition, after respecting the collegial procedure and consulting the trusted support person, the family and, where appropriate, the patient's advance directives\". To come closer to respecting the patient's wishes, the concept of testifying to what the person would have wished is used here. This testimony may be given in writing by the patient (advance directives), or verbally by those close to the patient, in particular the trusted support person (if the patient has designated one).\n\nThe principle of advance directives originated in the United States, also known as living wills, at the end of the 1960s, to enable patients' opinions to be incorporated into the end-of-life decision-making process. In 1990, the Patient Self Determination Act, passed by the US Congress, made it compulsory for patients to be informed of these advance directives on admission to all hospitals. It also obliges professionals to systematically check whether or not their patients have drawn up such documents, and to indicate this in their medical records.  In France, a survey in 2000 revealed that only 6% of patients undergoing life-sustaining treatment (LATA) in intensive care had advance directives or had designated a contact person (equivalent to a trusted support person) authorised to represent them. This is why the 2005 law introduced this system, with the aim of ensuring that professionals offer it to patients, without imposing it, and are obliged to find out whether any directives have been drawn up when they decide to stop or limit treatment.\n\nThe changes made to the law in 2016 were necessary to reiterate that refusing any treatment at the end of life is the patient's right and that his or her wishes must be respected. This is why the aim was to strengthen and clarify the role of advance directives. It should be emphasised that, from now on, this law will establish a hierarchy in terms of the ways in which a patient's wishes can be traced: firstly, the advance directives, then failing that, the testimony of the trusted support person, and failing that, any other testimony from the family or close friends.\n\nBut questions remain, particularly when patients have not drawn up advance directives, or when these are not adapted to the clinical situation, or when a trusted support person has not been designated, or when relatives disagree. In all these situations, teams must continue to work towards dialogue and ethical discussion in the name of the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.  \n\n\n\n'''What the law on the end of life emphasises:'''\n\n- The idea is for all professionals to be able to discuss this law on the end of life, advance directives and their place in relation to the trusted support person, at the appropriate time, depending on how the illness is progressing, with their patients.\n\n- An obligation on healthcare professionals to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that every person has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible alleviation of suffering.\n\n- Recognition of a patient's right to stop or limit treatment as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n- An obligation for the doctor to respect the patient's wish to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing the patient of the consequences of his or her choices and their seriousness.\n\n- A greater role for doctors in informing patients about the possibility of drawing up advance directives and/or appointing a trusted support person.\n\n- The need for collegial decision-making.\n\n- The fact that the advance directives enshrined in the law are now enforceable, meaning that the referring doctors of an unconscious patient must follow the perspectives written in this document if they are appropriate to the medical situation.\n\n- The fact that there is a hierarchy concerning the means of tracing a patient's wishes: first of all the advance directives, then failing that the testimony of the trusted support person, then failing that any other testimony from the family or close friends.

Every year, hundreds of thousands of women have recourse to it (see item 37 \"Voluntary termination of pregnancy\").\n\n=== 1) This right illustrates the ethic of responsibility of the medical profession ===\nWhatever the value judgement made about a woman's wish to terminate her pregnancy, or moral convictions about the value of foetal life, or views about the psychological impact of a procedure that is certainly not harmless, the 1975 law above all provided a medical framework for a practice that was both frequent and risky, as not all women were on the same footing. The law made it possible to guarantee equal and safe access to this procedure.\n\nIn other words, whether we consider that the right to abortion is a natural consequence of women's freedom, or whether we question it in terms of principles and conceptions of human life, we can agree that it is first and foremost a \"public health\" policy.\n\n=== 2) This right illustrates a compromise between different moral conceptions of procreation ===\nSome \"pro-life\" movements see abortion as the equivalent of infanticide. But when does the life of a human being begin? Only at birth? From the moment of conception? Or even before, when the plan to raise a child takes shape? Or why not even after birth, through various rites (registration, presentation to the family, baptisms, etc.)?\n\nThe question of the beginning of human life remains a contentious one, to which philosophical and religious traditions have responded in different ways, often with a degree of ambiguity. The beginning of life has always been socially negotiated (traditionally through the visible signs of pregnancy). Nor is biology able to draw a clear line on the continuum between a simple cluster of cells and a human being. Even the criterion of foetal viability depends on the context and the technical resources available.\n\nUnder these conditions, the right to abortion is a balance between consideration for the individual and respect for life. As stated in article 16 of the Civil Code, \"the law ensures the primacy of the person, prohibits any attack on his dignity and guarantees respect for the human being from the beginning of his life\". However, the living embryo has no legal status. The Comit\u00e9 Consultatif National d'\u00c9thique describes it as a \"potential human person\", which makes it possible to avoid granting it rights (which would be enforceable against the woman carrying it) while still showing it consideration and respect. This compromise, developed over the last few decades, provides a balanced framework at the crossroads of different visions of the world and of human life.\n\n=== 3) Effective access to this right is a serious ethical issue ===\nIn the face of various kinds of \"slippery slope\" arguments (e.g. that abortion would lead to eugenics), the Veil law initially introduced safeguards designed to limit excessive or abusive recourse to abortion. For example, there was a 7-day reflection period imposed on women between the first consultation for an abortion and the procedure itself. This constraint came to be seen not only as an unnecessary complication, but also as infantilising women by casting suspicion on their autonomy. During the debate that led to the vote to abolish the cooling-off period in 2017, the French Health Minister said: \"The relationship with abortion has not been trivialised, it has been normalised. A woman who has made up her mind doesn't need time\".\n\nSimilarly, the conscience clause that healthcare professionals can invoke is regulated. Of course, \"a doctor or midwife is never obliged to carry out a voluntary interruption of pregnancy\" (Article L2212-8 of the French Public Health Code). However, any professional who refuses to do so must immediately put the woman concerned in touch with other professionals. In this way, the conscience clause must not stand in the way of access to this right.\n\nSome individuals and organisations have set themselves the goal of obstructing access to abortion by various means, for example by disseminating false information, intimidating healthcare professionals and putting pressure on healthcare establishments. The \"offence of hindering abortion\", which has existed since 1993, was clarified and extended in 2017, and these acts are subject to severe penalties. At the same time, initiatives have been taken by the public authorities to provide access to reliable information (toll-free number 0800 08 11 11; Official website <nowiki>https://ivg.gouv.fr/</nowiki>).\n\nThe fact remains that \"effective\" access to abortion for all women who want it, wherever they are, remains fragile. All the more so as the very principle of this right is far from being recognised everywhere, and is even being called into question in countries where it seemed to have been taken for granted (as the recent example of the United States has shown).",

Trials on non-patients were illegal. Approvals were granted on the basis of expert opinion. From 1975 onwards, demands for scientific proof and rigorous methodologies began to emerge.\n\n==Loi Huriet-S\u00e9rusclat (20 December 1988)==\nThis law sets out the principle of equality for all participants, whether sick or not. The terms \"protection of individuals\" are preferred to \"human experimentation\". It establishes two types of research: with direct individual benefit and without direct individual benefit. Constraints are heavier for the second type: it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the research sites, and the promoter may be held liable, even without fault.\n\nConsent must be \"free, informed and express\", in accordance with international texts. Special protection is sought for \"vulnerable\" persons. In keeping with the principle that the human body should be free of charge, the \"non-commercialisation\" of the human body is affirmed. No remuneration is possible, but \"compensation\" for participants \"without direct individual benefit\" who are not hospitalised is possible.\n\nThe law provides for the creation of Consultative Committees for the Protection of Individuals in Biomedical Research (CCPPRB), independent of the administrative authority. Research will not be possible if it is not based on the latest state of knowledge, if it is not preceded by sufficient pre-clinical experimentation, if there is a foreseeable risk out of all proportion to the expected benefit, if it does not aim to extend scientific knowledge of human beings and the means likely to improve their condition, if it is not designed to reduce pain, fear or discomfort. All these conditions are cumulative.\n\nIt can only be carried out under the direction and supervision of an experienced doctor. The material and technical conditions must be appropriate to the trial and compatible with the requirements of scientific rigour and personal safety. The interests of the patient must always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society.\n\nThis law is beneficial in that it provides legal certainty for investigators and requires prior examination of protocols and informed consent. However, a number of difficulties remain: it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a study has direct benefit or not, and the protection afforded to patients is worse than that afforded to healthy volunteers.\n\n==Law of 9 August 2004\nThis law transposes the 2001 European directive on clinical trials. It defines biomedical research: \"Biomedical research is research organised and carried out on human beings with a view to developing biological or medical knowledge\". Research occurs when, over and above the act of providing care and the immediate interests of the patient, the doctor seeks to advance scientific knowledge, i.e. to identify and formalise general teaching. This applies not only to the testing of techniques and products, but also to cognitive research.\n\nThe notions of direct or indirect benefit have been abandoned in favour of the notion of interventional and non-interventional trials. Non-interventional trials are excluded from the reform (observational survey, epidemiology). Research into routine care is subject to simplified procedures. Protocols are assessed on the basis of the benefit/risk balance rather than the therapeutic benefit. Protection is strengthened and the different protection regimes disappear.\n\nThe roles of the various players are well defined. The promoter is the natural or legal person who initiates the research, manages it and verifies its funding. The investigator is the natural person who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a given site. Where there are several investigators, a coordinator is appointed.\n\nThe Committees for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) replace the CCPPRB. The CPP is made up of fourteen members in two colleges. The medical college comprises four people qualified in research, including at least two doctors and one epidemiologist or biostatistician, one general practitioner, one hospital pharmacist and one nurse. The societal college is made up of a person qualified in ethics, a psychologist, a social worker, two persons qualified in legal matters and two representatives of associations (article R.1123-4 of the Public Health Code).\n\nThe opinion of the CPP becomes necessary and favourable. It is decision-making and no longer advisory. This opinion takes into account the information provided to the subject (time for reflection, adequacy, completeness and intelligibility of written information, oral information supported by a written text), the title of the protocol, the contact details of the sponsor and coordinating investigator, the objective, methodology and duration of the research, the expected benefits, the constraints and foreseeable risks, medical alternatives, care arrangements at the end of the research, access to results at the end of the research, confidentiality of data, the date of the opinion of the CPP and the authorisation of the competent authority and the insurance certificate issued by the sponsor. This opinion also takes account of the written consent obtained by the investigator, which must be free and informed. There are special cases: in the case of minors, consent is obtained from the legal representative; in the case of persons unable to express themselves, it is obtained from the trusted support person or the guardianship judge; in an emergency, it is obtained from the family or the trusted support person if they are present. The CPP's opinion is also based on the relevance of the research (scientific, methodological and ethical), the match between the objectives and the resources deployed, the satisfactory nature of the assessment of the expected benefits and risks and the soundness of the conclusions, the procedures for recruiting participants, the amount and procedures for compensating participants, registration on the National Volunteer Register (Internet) to prevent abuse, compliance with an exclusion period between two research studies, the quality of the research sites and the qualifications of the investigators.\n\nThe French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has become the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM). For products other than medicinal products, the competent authority is the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9 (DGS). The declaration system is replaced by an authorisation system. Authorisation is valid for one year. The ANSM may request additional information or suspend research.\n\nSubjects taking part in the research must undergo a prior medical examination, be affiliated to a social security scheme, be registered in the national database, and have access to the overall results and information relating to their state of health. They may receive compensation, subject to a ceiling, for the constraints they have undergone or for the damage they have suffered (by the sponsor in the event of negligence or by a compensation fund in the absence of negligence). They may not take part in more than one research project at the same time.\n\nPatient associations and health system users are represented on the CPPs. Overall research results must be communicated. They may be included in national and European research databases (unless the sponsor objects).\n\n==Law of 5 March 2012 (Jard\u00e9 Law)==\nIn the law of 5 March 2012, also known as the \"law on research involving the human person\" (RIPH), the term \"biomedical research\" has been removed. It aims to provide a single framework for medical research and simplify the procedures involved. It distinguishes between three types of research: interventional research with risk, interventional research with negligible risk (aimed at evaluating routine care) and non-interventional or observational research.\n\nTypes of research defined by the law on research involving the human person :\n\n===1st category: interventional research involving an intervention on a person that is not justified by his or her usual care===\nIn risky interventional research, the intervention on the individual is not justified by his or her usual care (use of a new molecule, for example). Consent must be free, informed and express, and given in writing.\n\nThis research focuses on :\n\n*on medicinal products;\n*other health products (mentioned in article L.5311-1 of the French Public Health Code);\n*foodstuffs.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*authorisation from the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam for research involving medicinal products;\n*favourable opinion from the CPP (Committee for the Protection of Individuals);\n*specific insurance cover taken out by the sponsor;\n*formalities with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (CNIL; for example, commitment to comply with the MR001 reference methodology);\n*EudraCT number (used to identify each study carried out in the European Union; the sponsor must request this number from the European Medicines Agency).\n\n===2nd category: interventional research involving only minimal risks and constraints===\nNegligible-risk interventional research does not involve medicinal products and presents minimal risks and constraints. Consent must be free, informed and express, and may be obtained orally.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*favourable opinion from a CPP ;\n*no authorisation from the Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament (ANSM), but information (summary and opinion of the CPP sent);\n*insurance taken out by the sponsor;\n*CNIL procedures;\n*research registration number (the sponsor must request this from the Agence nationale de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament);\n*be part of the list established by the Order of 12 April 2018.\n\nResearch in the second category involves healthy or sick people. The minimal nature of the risks and constraints associated with carrying out the procedure(s) is assessed in the light of :\n\n*gender\n*age\n*physical condition\n*the pathology, if any, of the person undergoing the research;\n*frequency and duration.\n\nSuch research may involve the use of health products, but these are then used under the usual conditions of use. It may involve minimally invasive procedures (venous blood sampling, non-invasive imaging, etc.).\n\n===3rd category: non-interventional research===\nNon-interventional research involves no risks or constraints. All procedures are carried out and all products are used in the usual way.\n\nThe subject must be informed and his or her non-opposition must be sought.\n\nTerms and conditions:\n\n*favourable opinion from a CPP ;\n*no authorisation from the ANSM but information (summary and CPP opinion sent);\n*application to the CNIL.\n\n\nThe CPP is involved in all types of research, and its opinion must be favourable for all three types.\n\nThe territorial jurisdiction of the CPPs has been abolished, and the CPPs come under the supervision of a National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person, which is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and assessing the practices of the CPPs.  The CPP will make its decision within forty-five days. If the CPP remains silent after this period, the application is rejected.\n\nResearch involving retrospective data (e.g. theses on medical files) is excluded from this framework as it does not concern individuals but data. Such research is subject solely to the opinion of the CNIL, which is based on a prior opinion from the Comit\u00e9 d'expertise pour les recherches, les \u00e9tudes et les \u00e9valuations dans le domaine de la sant\u00e9 (CEREES).\n\nThe different players\n\n*The French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM):\n**is responsible for the methodology of first category trials (after implementation of the BR),\n**issues a registration number for the first, second and third categories of research. Please note: the EUDRACT number for interventional research involving a medicinal product is provided by the European Medicines Agency, the ID-RCB number is provided by the ANSM for all other research,\n**receives the summary and the opinion of the CPP for second and third category research.\n\n*The National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person (CNRIPH), created in 2018, is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and evaluating the practices of the CPPs.\n*The Committee for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) is made up of fourteen full members divided into two colleges.\n*The promoter is the natural person or legal entity responsible for research involving human subjects, who manages the project and ensures that it is financed. The sponsor or its legal representative must be established in the European Union. The sponsor is usually a pharmaceutical laboratory, a research centre or a health establishment such as a university hospital.\n*The investigator is the natural person(s) who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a site. This is most often a doctor.\n\n==Ethical issues==\nDespite the strict normative framework for research, unpredictable situations, harmful effects and unethical drifts can still be observed.\n\nThe principle of protecting vulnerable populations can have a paradoxical effect by excluding these populations from clinical trials, and therefore denying them access to new therapies. In this case, equity in access to care is not respected.\n\nIn some studies, the adverse effect, which had not been observed in animals, causes significant damage in human subjects because it is specific to humans. This unpredictable adverse effect occurs even though the research has been properly conducted following a test in animals.\n\nHow can we be sure that informed consent is genuine when the subject is illiterate or does not understand the language, when the subject is a child or when the subject is incapable of giving consent? What is the value of the consent obtained? There can be no remuneration, but expenses may be reimbursed. Is there any form of control in this case? When the products studied are marketed, will their cost guarantee fair access for all? What will be the accessibility of the product for subjects who wanted to or had to withdraw from the study?\n\nMany questions remain, despite all the attention paid to subjects suitable for biomedical research.\n\n\nKey points\n\n*Research involving human subjects is subject to strict legal supervision. This framework is essential to enable research to develop while respecting individuals.\n*Since 2012, there has been a single legislative framework for all research involving humans. Research is classified into three types depending on whether or not it is interventional and on the risk involved.\n*The roles of the players involved in a research protocol are well defined (investigator, sponsor).\n*The personal protection committees play an important role and provide a decision-making opinion.\n*The competent authority is the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines.",

It therefore requires recourse to medically assisted procreation. It enables couples at high risk of transmitting a genetic disease to avoid the ordeal of prenatal diagnosis (Preimplantation Diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>) and possible termination of pregnancy. PGD allows only embryos free of the genetic disease present in the family to be transferred. In France, the practice of PGD is highly regulated. It is only authorised in exceptional cases, when a couple has a high probability of giving birth to a child suffering from a particularly serious genetic disease recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis [[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\nEthical issues. The ethical debate primarily concerns possible developments in this activity. Although the initial indications for PGD were those of prenatal diagnosis, they have since evolved considerably. A wide variety of PGD applications have developed. The most controversial practices are (1) HLA typing of embryos for haematological disorders and (2) determination of embryonic sex for personal convenience ('social sexing').\n\n(1) The possibility of selecting embryos so that they are immunologically compatible with a sick brother or sister requiring a marrow transplant is being sought so that the child, once born, can be a potential cord blood donor. This possibility opened up by PGD brings us back to the concept of the \"medicine baby\" (or \"donor baby\", or \"double hope baby\"), and with it the debate on the possible instrumentalisation of procreation. In France, HLA typing of embryos for hereditary diseases is authorised. However, when there is no risk of hereditary disease, HLA typing is prohibited. The CCNE's position was clear: \"The primary justification for PGD is the birth of a child free from a serious genetic disorder that threatens him or her. The search for immunological compatibility with a sick elder child must always come second\". The absence of any direct benefit for the embryo therefore prohibits recourse to this type of procedure. However, this application is being developed in other countries in cases where a first-born child with cancer could benefit from a compatible cord blood cell transplant. In these countries, the absence of regulations authorises these practices, becoming a source of medical nomadism.\n\n(2) The ethical debate on sex diagnosis for convenience pits supporters of the absolute freedom to have children as one wishes, with whom one wishes, when one wishes, of the sex one wishes, as an inalienable expression of Freedom, against defenders of gender equality as an equally inalienable expression of the principle of Gender Equality. Supporters of social sexing argue that choosing a child's sex is not contrary to the principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence and justice ('principalism'). They point out that this practice does not entail any societal risks or eugenics, but does help to balance the sexes in a family. Opponents of sex selection point to the potential harm to the child, the risk of eugenics and gender standardisation.\n\n[Pre-implantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] Prenatal diagnosis (PND) refers to medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus \"in utero\".\n\n[Preimplantation diagnosis OIC-009-16-B#sdfootnote2anc|2] Chromosomal abnormality, risk of aneuploidy, autosomal recessive diseases (including cystic fibrosis, B-thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy), autosomal dominant diseases (including steinert's disease, Huntington's chorea, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) and X-linked diseases (including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy, haemophilia, fragile X).

In medicine: the questioning of the principles, values and rules governing the actions of practitioners and researchers, with a view to justifying them.\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Guillaume Grandazzi, Myl\u00e8ne Gouriot, Gr\u00e9goire Moutel\n|Order=1}}<br />\n\n=== Meaning and definition of ethics, as distinct from morality and deontology ===\nEthics is the ability of individuals to reflect critically on the moral dimension of their individual and collective actions and practices. It is a reflexive ability that enables people to question the morality of their actions and the relevance of the values, standards and rules that dictate that they should act in a particular way. It is a skill that makes it possible to question morality, because it is both the place where moral standards are produced and the place where they are questioned. Where morality provides answers and restricts freedom, ethics allows us to question our choices, to arbitrate between contradictory moral obligations. Ethics recognises moral pluralism (of values) but also the need to reach agreement beyond this pluralism, through the use of reason and discussion in a democratic context.\n\nThe issues raised in medical practice by developments in science and in our society (patients' rights, access to care, the concept of the family, the use of genetics, gamete and embryo conservation, organ removal, computerisation of medical record data, biomedical research, loss of autonomy, end of life, etc.) require individual and collective reflection to consider the good or bad consequences of decisions and to arbitrate sometimes complex choices in care practices or the organisation of the healthcare system.\n\nToday, every decision involves a multidisciplinary balancing act between medical scientific data, the rights of individuals (personal protection, information, consent), individual desires, collective values and norms and the economic constraints that guide our society.\n\nThe ethical approach aims to organise the way in which decisions are taken in each situation, taking into account these different and sometimes contradictory elements. Ethics is therefore not a value judgement (like morality, which prescribes or forbids), or a code of good practice often linked to legal rules (like deontology), but a process of reflection and analysis to help decision-making. These distinctions are important. Morality reflects the state of thinking in a society (or part of a society) at a given time or reflects a dogma. It derives from a set of principles that determine what is good in Aristotle's sense: it is normative, approves or disapproves, rewards or punishes. Deontology brings together, within a code, the rules of good professional practice that mark out the relationship between carer and patient. It defines a framework for professional responsibility and derives from principles derived from the Hippocratic Oath and from legislation governing medical practice. The law, for its part, encompasses all the rules that govern our society, and the obligations and duties of each individual. When applied to the healthcare and public health system, we speak of health law. It stems from numerous legislative texts (law on patients' rights, bioethics laws, laws organising the healthcare system, etc.) and is set out in codes (Public Health Code, Civil Code, Criminal Code). It is designed to manage conflicts and impose penalties and compensation. It is enforced by the courts. Ethics and law are closely intertwined and may evolve over time. Ethics, on the other hand, is an approach. Its aim is to re-examine moral principles and deontological and legal rules, particularly when they do not provide answers in line with the wishes of the people concerned, or when the situation in question cannot be resolved. Ethics is thus the result of active, collective, interactive reflection on human values and on the tensions between wills and other logics. It studies values, tensions, criteria for choice and the various possible scenarios. It works through argument and debate. In medical practice, it is essential because it helps to guide choices towards concrete decisions that primarily concern a single person: the patient.\n\nAs a way of questioning how we should act, ethics is above all a multi-disciplinary reflection, in the sense that all the human sciences, law, health sciences and care professionals participate in the construction of the reflection by their varied contributions concerning the individual as well as society and its institutions. This is why ethics is not, in the strict sense of the term, a science. It is not the subject of positive knowledge, nor does it result simply from the study of facts and behaviour. Such a study, while of real interest, is not enough to establish values; describing and explaining what is is not enough to define what should be.\n\n=== Ethics of responsibility and applied ethics ===\nIn the ethics of responsibility, the idea is to go further by feeling responsible for all the consequences of our actions, with in particular the need for a critical analysis of a rule or a decision if they are not accepted by all or are not suitable for all, \"a fortiori\" if we know that they may have harmful consequences for the equilibrium of a person or a group of people. In this way, the ethics of responsibility leads to a willingness to act not by making automatic choices, but each time in a singular and reasoned way, in favour of a consequentialist approach.\n\nThis means maximising knowledge of the consequences of choices and actions. So, as the objective of responsibility demands, all anticipatory ethics becomes a branch of research with an obligation for collective analysis that should be cultivated by encouraging the cooperation of many experts in the most diverse fields, most often inviting a cross-disciplinary approach. But there is also a need for debate with the people affected, patients and, more broadly, the general public. So any decision involving the future of one or more people, or \"a fortiori\" everyone, needs to be at the heart of an approach that looks at future consequences, sharing information on benefits, doubts, uncertainties and risks. Any practice that involves risk or uncertainty, or that may call into question a particular human value, must be debated.\n\nThis approach is fully applicable to the medical field. Given the many upheavals that medicine has brought about in the course of our lives and in the organisation of society (quality of life, the future of the individual, disability, death, suffering, procreation, screening and prediction, etc.), the question of biopower over individuals has been raised, and today medical risks and practices are under the microscope.\n\nIf we want to promote a democratic approach to health issues and encourage people's freedom and responsibility in this area, we need to link medical progress with recognition of social expectations. This link is particularly important when dealing with practices that have a major impact on people's lives, especially if the benefits are debated and/or there are risks involved.\n\nThis is why ethics in healthcare is intended to be practical and operational, i.e. ethics that are not just conceptual, but that lead to advice to guide action and choices. This is why we speak of applied ethics.\n\nApplied ethics is based either on descriptive analyses of cases, or on surveys of situations, or on sociological or ethno-medical studies. On the one hand, it proposes the analysis of professional practices, with the aim of addressing the attitudes and behaviour of all those involved when faced with a problematic situation, and on the other, an argument on the consequences of the various possible choices. When it applies to specific cases, it is referred to as 'micro-ethics', and when it concerns societal choices or healthcare policies, it is referred to as 'macro-ethics'. Applied ethics aims to guide decision-making.",

For some of these drugs, use as ''monotherapy'' could be granted at a later stage.\n\n== Mechanisms of action ==\nAnti-epileptic drugs act essentially by ''limiting hyperexcitability'', which favours the triggering of seizures. These effects result in particular from an action on the ''ion channels'' involved in ''hyperexcitability'' or are consecutive to the restoration of the ''GABA / Glutamate balance''.\n\nThere are ''several mechanisms of action'', some of which are common to many anti-epileptic drugs:\n\n* Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels involved in neurotransmission:\n** Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels is the main mechanism common to many anti-epileptic drugs (valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, felbamate, topiramate, zonisamide, rufinamide, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine).\n** Blockade of P/Q-type calcium channels (gabapentin, pregabalin), T-type calcium channels (valproic acid, ethosuximide, zonisamide) or potassium channels (levetiracetam) is probably more incidental.\n* Reduction of glutamatergic tone by inhibition of vesiculosynaptic protein 2A (levetiracetam, brivaracetam) or by glutamate receptor antagonism (felbamate, topiramate, perampanel, phenobarbital).\n* Reinforcement of GABAergic tone either directly ('valproic acid', 'gabapentin') or via GABA-A receptor agonists ('phenobarbital', 'benzodiazepines', topiramate'', ''felbamate''), ''GABA transaminase inhibitors'' (vigabatrin, stiripentol) or ''GABA reuptake inhibitors'' (''tiagabine'', ''stiripentol'').\n\nMost drugs are likely to exert an anti-epileptic effect by modulating several targets.\n\n== Indications\nThe choice of treatment takes into account the activity profile of the compound, the syndromic type of epilepsy and any contraindications for the patient. For example, valproic acid is particularly effective in generalised epilepsy, while carbamazepine is most active in partial epilepsy. The prescription of some of these anti-epileptic drugs requires specialised management, particularly when several drugs are combined or when high-risk drugs are prescribed, especially in the case of drug-resistant partial epilepsies or specific epileptic syndromes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|'''Broad-spectrum antiepileptics'''\n\n'''''Generalised and partial epilepsies'''''\n|Narrow-spectrum antiepileptics\n\n'''''Partial epilepsy with or without generalisation'''''\n|-\n|Valproic acid\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\nPerambanel\n\nPhenobarbital\n\nLamotrigine\n\nLevetiracetam\n\nTopiramate\n\nZonisamide\n\nRufinamide\n\nFelbamate\n|Carbamazepine\n\nPhenytoin\n\nGabapentin\n\nPregabalin\n\nLacosamide\n\nOxcarbazepine\n\nEslicarbazepine\n\nTiagabine\n\nVigabatrine\n|}\nBenzodiazepines, in particular clonazepam, are more commonly used on an occasional basis, particularly in the event of status epilepticus. In this particular context, second-line treatments consist of injectable fosphenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital or levetiracetam.\n\nSome anti-epileptic drugs also have indications in other fields. These include neuropathic pain (pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine), the treatment of migraine (topiramate) and the regulation of mood disorders during bipolar illness (valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine).\n\n== Undesirable effects and contraindications ==\nAll antiepileptic drugs have dose-dependent effects on the central nervous system (sedation, dizziness, visual disturbances, tremors). They also induce \"cognitive disorders\" and \"psychiatric effects\" (depression, anxiety, psychotic reactions), particularly with levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, vigabatrin and perampanel. It should also be noted that idiosyncratic reactions (skin, hepatitis, bone marrow damage) can sometimes be severe.\n\nWeight gain is reported with several of these drugs (valproic acid, carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, perambanel), while other anti-epileptics (topiramate, zonisamide, felbamate, striripentol, rufinamide) cause weight loss.\n\n''Phenobarbital'', ''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'' and ''valproic acid'' are '''teratogenic''' drugs requiring '''precautions for use''' in '''<u>women of childbearing age</u>'''.\n\n=== Other side effects to consider ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|'''Drug''''\n|Frequent adverse reactions\n|'''Serious adverse reactions'''\n|-\n|Valproic acid\n|Nausea, vomiting, alopecia\n|thrombocytopenia, aplasia, hepatitis, pancreatitis\n|-\n|Carbamazepine\n|Leukoneutropenia, rash\n|Hyperponatremia, BAV, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis\n|-\n|Islicarbazepine\n|Leuconeutropenia\n|Hyponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis, AVB\n|-\n|Ethosuximide\n|Nausea\n|Bullous rash, agranulocytosis\n|-\n|Felbamate\n|Leukoneutropenia, rash\n|bone marrow aplasia, hepatitis, Lyell's disease\n|-\n|Lacosamide\n|Nausea, vomiting\n|stroke, atrial fibrillation, flutter\n|-\n|Lamotrigine\n|Leukoneutropenia\n|Rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis\n|-\n|Levotetracetam\n|Nausea\n|Hematologic disorders\n|-\n|Oxcarbazepine\n|Nausea, leukoneutropenia\n|Hyperponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, BAV\n|-\n|Phenobarbital\n|Rash\n|Dupuytren's disease, scapulohumeral periarthritis, hepatitis, megaloblastic anaemia\n|-\n|Phenytoin\n|Rash, gingival hypertrophy\n|Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, pseudo-lymphoma, lupus syndrome\n|-\n|Rufinamide\n|Nausea, vomiting\n|QT depression, hypersensitivity\n|-\n|Topiramate\n|Anorexia, oligohydrosis\n|Renal lithiasis, acidosis, glaucoma\n|-\n|Vigabatrin\n|Digestive disorders\n|Visual field narrowing\n|-\n|Zonisamide\n|Anorexia, oligohydrosis\n|Stevens-Johnson, renal lithiasis, bone marrow aplasia, hyperthermia\n|}\n\n== Drug interactions ==\nAnti-epileptic drugs pose a number of difficulties in terms of ''drug-drug interactions'', as several of them are capable of ''modifying the metabolism of other drugs''. For example, several anti-epileptics (''phenobarbital'', ''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'') are '''<u>enzyme inducers</u>'' while valproic acid'' is a '''<u>enzyme inhibitor</u>''' drug.\n\nIn addition to the problem of the interaction of anti-epileptic drugs with other drugs, it is important to stress the \"risk of interaction between anti-epileptic drugs\" leading to a risk of \"ineffectiveness\" or \"toxicity\" by \"reduction\" or \"increase\" of plasma concentrations. Certain combinations are particularly inadvisable, such as the valproic acid/lamotrigine combination (skin toxicity). Finally, it should be noted that phenytoin and stiripentol are metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 respectively, two enzymes which are subject to genetic polymorphism, and are both subject to variability of effect and a significant risk of drug interactions.\n\n== Monitoring methods ==\nThe monitoring of epileptic patients undergoing treatment must take into account ''several dimensions''.\n\n=== Clinical monitoring ===\n\n* The patient's '''overall progress''', '''efficacy''' and '''adverse effects''' of anti-epileptic treatments must be assessed at '''each consultation''' and '''<u>at least once a year</u>''':\n** Nutritional status and measurements (particularly in children) ;\n** The presence/persistence of attacks ;\n** Compliance with treatment and adherence of the carer;\n** The most common co-morbidities: anxiety syndrome, depression, suicidal risk, attention disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive disorders;\n** Undesirable effects potentially linked to treatment;\n** Social repercussions.\n* Treatments'' must be ''regularly re-evaluated'' to ensure that patients are not being treated inappropriately (prolonged, unnecessary, ineffective, poorly tolerated or incorrectly dosed treatment).\n* The use of ''tools'' such as a ''crisis monitoring calendar'' to facilitate management is recommended.\n\n=== Biological monitoring ===\n\n* Blood tests for drugs are \"not recommended\" on a \"systematic\" basis and should only be carried out \"if clinically indicated\".\n* Minor asymptomatic biological abnormalities (discreet elevation of transaminases, etc.) are not a formal indication for a change in antiepileptic treatment, but do require biological monitoring.\n* The monitoring of adverse biological reactions must be \"adapted\" according to each antiepileptic drug used and the patient's condition.\n\n=== Electrophysiological monitoring ===\n\n* The ''''EEG can be ''useful'' for the ''follow-up'' and ''monitoring'' under treatment of patients with epilepsy.\n* The frequency with which it is performed depends mainly on the patient's epileptic syndrome.\n\n== Main causes of failure ==\nThere are several reasons for treatment failure:\n\n* Inappropriate drug prescription'' due to a syndromic ''diagnostic error''.\n* Compliance failure'' which can be reduced by therapeutic education'' '''' of the patient and those around him in the context of a complex chronic disease.\n* Occurrence of undesirable effects, the impact of which can be partly limited by \"progressive titration\" (reduction in dose-dependent undesirable effects) and above all by informing the patient in advance and close monitoring.\n* Drug resistance, which potentially affects 20% of patients and requires treatment in an expert centre.",

For a long time, death was recognised through the inanimate or cold corpse. Then came the notion of death due to cardiac arrest and then encephalic death.\n\nIn 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined this new definition of death as encephalic death, but it was not officially recognised until 1968 in the circular legalising the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the so-called Jeanneney circular).\n\nIt can therefore be said that today there are two ways of being dead, as stated in \"Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes and amending the Public Health Code\".)\n\n# Patient in cardiac arrest (clinical criteria) :\n#* Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation;\n#* Abolition of all brain stem reflexes;\n#* Absence of spontaneous ventilation;\n#* In this case samples must be taken rapidly.\n# Patient in a state of encephalic death:\n#* No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test;\n#* Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation;\n#* In these cases, sampling may be deferred and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state in order to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.\n\nIn this context, it is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:\n\n* people in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I);\n* people in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II);\n* people for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment because of the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III);\n* people who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).\n\nEncephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. In addition, the general public fears that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. So we need to be very clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. We need to listen, explain and support them. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels on this subject: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.\n\n\n'''A special case: organ donation and the medico-legal obstacle'''\n\n* If there is a \"medico-legal obstacle\" at the time of death... this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.\n* BUT :\n** Agreement of the Public Prosecutor+++ (role of the forensic pathologist+++) / The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.\n** The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.\n** The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",

Potter, the biologist and cancer specialist who 'coined' the term bioethics in the early 1970s, saw it as \"a global ethic for the survival of human beings and the planet\". He wanted to see an alliance between the biological sciences and ethics, between science and the humanities, and social control of scientific knowledge and progress.\n\nHowever, the creation in 1971 of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University in the United States restricted bioethics to the medical field. The American sociologist R. Fox has identified three stages in the development of bioethics. In the 1960s, bioethics first became part of a growing awareness of the problems involved (medical experimentation, resuscitation and organ transplants, etc.), and religious figures entered the field. In the 1970s, jurists and philosophers secularised the debate and contributed to the development of regulatory frameworks: the need for rational, argumentative debate and the recognition of fundamental principles came to the fore. In the 90s, economic issues and concerns became part of the debate, and the stakes of justice became increasingly important in a context of increasingly constrained resources.\n\nIn recent decades, the questions raised by medical progress (procreation, genetics, predictive medicine, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, etc.) have increasingly concerned the definition and future of our humanity. For example, the slogan of the 2018 Bioethics Forum was \"What kind of world do we want for tomorrow?\n\nContemporary developments in medicine have shifted the boundaries of therapeutic intervention: upstream of the disease (screening, prevention, procreation, etc.) and downstream (end of life, resuscitation, organ transplants, etc.). In most of these areas, the challenges are as much, if not more, societal than medical! Medical intervention at the frontiers of life increases the scope of our collective responsibility and transforms medical practices into societal problems with high moral stakes (who should be born and die, and under what conditions?). The questions raised by these practices must therefore be discussed in a rational and pluralist way.\n\nThe globalisation of Western biomedicine is also globalising the ethical issues associated with its development. In 2005, UNESCO published a \"Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights\", and in 2015 a book entitled \"Why Global Bioethics? In 2005, the World Medical Association published a \"Handbook of Medical Ethics\" for \"physicians and medical students worldwide\".\n\nBioethics should therefore follow the development of biomedicine throughout the world and establish itself as a model. But it is Western values that we are trying to disseminate internationally - certain conceptions of illness, life and death, or principles such as autonomy - in very different socio-cultural contexts. Is a global or universal bioethics possible without becoming the imposition of a dominant way of thinking?\n\nToday, contrary to V.R. Potter's vision, bioethics is a sub-set of health ethics; it concerns the issues raised by the emergence of new biotechnologies and the questions raised by the application of these scientific advances to humans. The aim of bioethics is to explore the issues raised by the development and application of biomedical technologies, and to analyse the transition between what is possible and what should be.",

This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which consists of appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests.\n\nThere are several forms of personal protection, the three main ones being legal protection, curatorship and guardianship [[Learn about the three main forms of protection OIC-009-11-A#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>]].\n\n'''1) Safeguard of justice:'''\n\nSafeguard of justice is a temporary protective measure with limited effects, used to deal with an emergency situation where a person of legal age is at risk of taking action contrary to his or her interests.\n\nIt is taken pending either the person's recovery or the pronouncement of a curatorship or guardianship measure.\n\nIn its form, the safeguard of justice can be :\n\n- medical, resulting from a statement made by a doctor (either the doctor of the person to be protected or the doctor of the health establishment where the person is) to the public prosecutor.\n\n- judicial, i.e. requested by the guardianship judge, in particular if an application is made to the judge to place the person under guardianship or curatorship.\n\nThe person under court protection retains the capacity to perform all acts, but certain important acts (e.g. the sale of a property) may be specially entrusted to a proxy.\n\n'''2) Guardianship and curatorship:'''\n\nThe difference between guardianship and curatorship lies in the degree of constraint imposed by these measures. The consequences of establishing guardianship are greater than those of curatorship.\n\nA person placed under guardianship remains autonomous in everyday life, but must be accompanied by a guardian for important acts. The guardianship judge defines the actions that the person may or may not take on their own, depending on their condition.\n\nGuardianship is a more protective measure. A guardian represents the adult to be protected in everyday life. The guardianship judge determines which acts the protected person may or may not perform alone.\n\nThere are three types of acts defined by law: acts that the protected person can carry out themselves (e.g. shopping); acts that require the guardian's authorisation (e.g. renewing an identity card); acts that require the guardianship judge's authorisation (e.g. changing residence).\n\nThe duration of the protective measure is determined by the guardianship judge. If the protected person's condition does not seem likely to improve, the guardianship judge may decide to renew the guardianship.\n\n'''3) Protection of minors:''''\n\nGuardianship of a minor is a legal protection measure whereby another person helps to protect the minor's interests when the holders of parental authority can no longer exercise them. In this case, the judge appoints a family council, which appoints a guardian and a subrogated guardian (a person appointed by the family council to represent the protected person when the latter's interests conflict with those of the guardian. This person has an obligation to monitor the management of the guardian).\n\n'''To find out about the main implications of these protective measures, particularly as regards the rights of protected patients of full age, please refer to the previous knowledge objective (OIC-009-10-B Principles and purposes of personal protection measures)'''.\n\n[Knowing the three main protection measures OIC-009-11-A#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text borrows from several documents published by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Solidarity, Autonomy and the Disabled and the Ministry of Health and Prevention, and from consultations on justice.fr, solidarit\u00e9s-sant\u00e9.gouv.fr, service-public.fr.",

The principles approach</u>'''\n\nThe principles approach, proposed by Professors Tom L. Beauchamp and James F. Childress in 1979<ref>Tom L. Beauchamp, James F. Childress (1979). Principles of biomedical ethics. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> in the United States, is interesting, particularly for thinking in the context of healthcare practices, and has met with great success in the medical community. The principles-based analysis approach, known as principalism, proposes the study of the ethical issues involved in a medical practice or a choice of healthcare organisation, from the angle of four major principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice.\n\n'''Beneficence and non-maleficence'''\n\nBeneficence and non-maleficence stem directly from the medical tradition. In its Hippocratic conception, the care-giver-patient relationship is based on Aristotelian morality and \"Primum non nocere\". Historically, medical action whose aim is to do good, by refraining from doing harm, refers to the principle of beneficence; this is a moral principle according to which what is advantageous for a patient must be achieved. This presupposes that medical action is necessarily good by nature, that a medical act is medically validated (today we would say scientifically validated) and that it has been proven in the positive sense of the term. However, as this is not always the case and the benefit/risk balance may be uncertain, the principle of beneficence must be supplemented by the principle of non-maleficence, because the risk of harming a patient may exist. It must be taken into consideration and weighed up.\n\n'''Autonomy'''\n\nThe principle of autonomy derives from the so-called \"modern\" philosophy of the seventeenth century, which prefigured the Enlightenment of the eighteenth. In his Discourse on Method, Ren\u00e9 Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body as a condition of freedom. Freedom, which enables every person to judge what is right or good for them, is based on the act of the mind. The subject's autonomy can therefore be understood as the individual freedom to decide on his or her own preferences through internal deliberation based on a capacity for analysis. It is regulated by a social contract, in the sense given to it by Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in which individuals acquire rights within the framework of the common law, in favour of freedom of thought, belief and choice of destiny.\n\nIn the field of healthcare, the application of such an area of patient freedom may have been ignored. For a very long time, medical decisions were taken without the patient's consent, or even without informing him or her. This attitude has been described as 'paternalistic', and since the 1970s there has been a legitimate demand for patients to be involved in the choices that concern them. According to the definition given by the philosopher Tore Nilstun, paternalism consists in treating others in accordance with what you consider to be their good, while rarely subordinating any preferences, expressed or otherwise, to that good. In clinical practice today, the recognition of patient autonomy is reflected in the shared construction of the medical decision. This approach is commonly referred to as the co-decision process. It is based on the recognition of autonomy and is developed through an approach that now requires healthcare providers to inform and take into account the patient's questions, wishes and values. This autonomy must be recognised, but sometimes it cannot be considered an absolute, either because the patient is losing his autonomy and therefore his capacity to analyse and make decisions, or because the demands he may make in the name of his freedom cannot be reconciled with the values or organisation of our healthcare system or our society.\n\n'''Justice'''\n\nThe principle of justice is the result of a collective ideal. It can vary from one society to another. In our society and in the context of healthcare, justice is traditionally understood in terms of non-discrimination, universality, access to healthcare for all and solidarity. It is an open, broad and evolving concept. It undeniably has a strong moral dimension based on respect for the individual. But it is also the source of many ethical tensions, because what may be considered just by some may not be considered legitimate by others. It will undoubtedly be the subject of many debates in the years to come: how far will it be fair to limit access to certain expensive treatments? How far will it be fair to respond to all requests for collective solidarity? This concept therefore directly relates to political choices.\n\nThe nature of justice is above all a democratic choice. So-called redistributive justice (aimed at distributing wealth) involves arbitrating between what is morally desirable and what is materially possible. It can also raise the question of why some citizens should have more or less than others, and according to what criteria (age, merit, fragility, income, value to society, etc.). This would be the transition from the notion of universality to that of proportionate universalism (offering a benefit, but with modalities or intensity that vary according to need). The notion of justice is therefore closely linked to the issue of combating or reinforcing inequalities. It also involves the question of rights and duties: how do we strike a balance between what everyone is entitled to expect, and what we are entitled to expect from each other?\n\nBehind the concept of justice lies the concept of professional responsibility, in the strictest sense of the term: acting in accordance with the rules established by a society, i.e. the common law, with the corollary obligation to be accountable before the law. All professionals must therefore be familiar with the rule of law and incorporate it into their approach in order to assess whether they are complying with it or, if necessary, to justify the reason(s) for not applying it, or even transgressing it. This is a complex process, which requires the company not to act lightly, and to call on the services of high-level experts, in particular through collegial decision-making, and sometimes even through referral to the courts. This approach is particularly applied to end-of-life decisions, refusal of care, forced hospitalisation in geriatric or psychiatric care, or complex decisions to terminate pregnancies.\n\n<II. In practice'''</u>\n\nThe ethics of principles approach must therefore question each of them, in particular beneficence, non-maleficence, respect for autonomy and justice. First of all, this approach in no way precludes the addition of other principles. Furthermore, the idea is not that these four principles should necessarily be respected in a choice or an action, but that they should be systematically questioned in order to see, on the one hand, why and how they cannot all be respected and, on the other hand, how they compensate for each other.\n\nA decision may be acceptable if one of the principles is compromised but offset by the strength of the other three. The most classic example is the loss of autonomy of the subject, where action is nevertheless possible without the person's consent, because the action will be beneficial, not harmful, and judged to be just. Philosophers such as Emmanuel Levinas and Hans Jonas put forward the principle of beneficence and responsibility for others, which underpins the morality of action in relation to the fragility of others. Hans Jonas advocates a principle of responsibility towards the most fragile and action in the name of beneficence alone. This position avoids abandoning those who are losing their autonomy. But this action must be carried out with respect for mutual understanding, dignified support and the constant search, not for consent, but for the other person's as- sence, in other words the building of a path towards a form of adhesion. So, in the principalism approach, we must not conceive of each principle as an absolute, but as a point to be debated, whose possible transgression or adaptation must be ethically validated.",

For a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the \"trusted support person\" in the \"health democracy\" law of 4 March 2002.\n\nThe role of the trusted support person, in the original sense of the term, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically, and to liaise with the medical teams, once the patient has designated one (a designation that allows the confidentiality of information to be shared). In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.\n\nThis primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still seen only as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person is called upon to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is an important one.\n\nEven outside the hospital setting, anyone being cared for in our healthcare system may feel the need to be accompanied by someone close to them, regardless of the status of their illness (whether in the case of severe illnesses or \"ordinary\", everyday illnesses). In addition, any citizen, even if they are not ill, who receives a healthcare service (e.g. screening, preventive action, blood tests, X-rays, etc.), may also wish to be accompanied by someone. Finally, anyone can accidentally find themselves in a situation where they are faced with a complex end-of-life decision. From a more collective point of view, we should therefore offer this possibility of designation to all citizens, as soon as they meet their doctor, insofar as the law provides for the trusted support person to be consulted to testify to the subject's wishes, to find out a person's wishes regarding a decision to stop or limit life-sustaining treatment or the question of post-mortem organ removal, all situations that can arise accidentally independently of an illness.\n\nThe appointment of a trusted support person must therefore be extended beyond the context of severe pathologies and hospitalisation alone, to become a civic option, available to everyone in the general population, regardless of their clinical condition. In practice, patients and their families are not necessarily familiar with this procedure. It is the duty of every healthcare provider and every healthcare institution to offer it.\n\nThe first thing to do is to explain that any adult relative can be a trusted support person: brother, sister, parent, grandparent, uncle, aunt, spouse, partner, friend, member of an association, etc. You should explain to the patient the purpose of this appointment, while also explaining that it is not compulsory. It is a possibility that patients must be able to choose (accept or refuse if they feel neither the need nor the desire to do so), especially if they wish to keep the secret completely, or if they wish to protect all those close to them and keep their illness a secret.\n\nIn previous years, it has been observed that designated trusted third parties were sometimes unaware that they had been chosen by a patient, as they were not present and not involved in the designation process; this raised doubts about their legitimacy to subsequently participate in an ethical discussion concerning the patient. This is why, from now on, the designation, made in writing by the patient, must be co-signed by the designated person. The procedure for designating and collecting information from the trusted support person must therefore be properly organised, ensuring that there is a reference person within the healthcare team responsible for informing the patient and then the designated person.\n\nThe role of the carer is to advise the patient on the basis of his or her experience of the illness and the sometimes complex family or emotional environment. It is important to explain that both designation and non-designation are perfectly legitimate choices. This is why the Public Health Code stipulates that there is an obligation to propose a trusted support person, but not an obligation to designate one. Giving patients this freedom and guiding them in their best interests is an ethical responsibility. When explanations are given, the question of breaking confidentiality with regard to the designated relative should be discussed (how far does the patient wish to go with regard to confidences, at what point, etc.).\n\nWith regard to the persons designated, several important points will be raised, in particular their availability and their willingness to carry out this mission, which are essential to give meaning to the process. An explanation of how long the designation of a trusted support person is valid will be given: the law does not set a limit on the validity of the designation made. However, the ups and downs of life and the way a patient's experience of illness evolves mean that things can evolve and change over time. The spirit of the law and the legitimate variability of a person's choices mean that the patient should be informed of the possible change of designated person. The designation can be revoked at any time by the patient. For healthcare professionals, the recommendation is that the patient should be asked each time he or she is admitted to hospital again, or each time he or she undergoes a new cycle of care, whether the designated person will remain in place.\n\nIn fine, the designation should be made in writing, signed by the patient and the designated person, and recorded in the medical record, with precise contact details and the nature of the relationship between the patient and the designated person, including any updates.",

This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which consists of appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests. This measure must be proportionate and individualised, and must be introduced and implemented with respect for the protected person's freedoms, rights and dignity.\n\nThe 2007 law reforming the legal protection of adults strengthened the fundamental rights of protected persons. For example, the person concerned must be heard during the procedure for placing them under guardianship. The 2019 Act also strengthened the rights of protected adults, by promoting their autonomy wherever possible. Protected persons must receive from the person in charge of their protection measure, in a manner appropriate to their condition, all information concerning them [[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\n'''Protection of persons of full age''' :\n\nA person who has reached the age of majority is legally considered to be capable of carrying out all acts of civil life.\n\nHowever, a legal protection measure may be put in place when a person finds it impossible to look after his or her own interests, due to a medically certified impairment of his or her mental and/or physical faculties.\n\nPeople can anticipate their loss of autonomy by drawing up a future protection mandate. This enables people to choose in advance who will be responsible for protecting their interests when they are no longer able to do so.\n\n'''Protection of minors:''''\n\nA minor child may be placed under guardianship, whereby a person helps to protect the child's interests. Guardianship is opened when the holders of parental authority (the child's parents) can no longer exercise it (because the child has no parents, they are deceased, or their parental authority has been withdrawn).\n\n'''Protecting people with disabilities:''''\n\nParents can take steps to protect the interests of their child (minor or adult) with a disability when they are no longer able to do so.\n\nThis protective measure begins when the parents die or are no longer able to care for their child.\n\nIf the child is a minor, the parents can apply for guardianship of minors to protect his or her interests. If the child is of full age, they can use the future protection mandate.\n\n'''Rights of protected patients of full age:'''\n\n'''''The rights of adult patients under court protection and guardianship:'''''\n\nAdults under court protection or guardianship exercise their rights personally and receive information relating to their state of health directly. The curator may only receive this information from the doctor if the protected person authorises him to do so.\n\nLike any other patient, a protected adult must personally consent to the medical procedure under consideration. Consent may be withdrawn at any time and refusal must be respected, except in emergencies.\n\nMedical records are released at the patient's request, using the same procedure as for other adults.\n\n'''''The rights of adult patients under guardianship:'''''\n\nMedical information is given to the guardian. Once the guardian has access to information about the protected person's health, he or she must respect medical confidentiality. However, the adult under guardianship has the right to receive the information directly and to participate in the decision-making process concerning him or her. This information and this participation in the decision will then be adapted to the faculties of the protected person.\n\nThe consent of adults under guardianship must be systematically sought if they are able to express their wishes and participate in decisions concerning them. Consent may be revoked at any time. The consent of the legal representative alone must remain exceptional. In addition, except in emergencies, the guardian may not, without the judge's authorisation, take a decision that would seriously affect the integrity of the protected person or the privacy of his or her private life. Lastly, the doctor has the right to provide essential care if the guardian refuses, which could have serious consequences for the health of the protected adult.\n\nIn a guardianship situation, in principle, the medical file cannot be communicated to the protected person, but only to the guardian as his legal representative. However, it is the guardian's responsibility, as far as possible, to inform the protected adult of the contents of the medical file.\n\n\n[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text borrows from several documents published by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Solidarity, Autonomy and the Disabled and the Ministry of Health and Prevention, and from consultations on justice.fr, solidarit\u00e9s-sant\u00e9.gouv.fr, service-public.fr.\n\n[Principles and purposes of personal protection measures OIC-009-10-B#sdfootnote2anc|2]] For further information, consult the \"Charter of rights and freedoms of protected adults\".",

This is the most common case, and it meets clinical objectives. There is also the special case of the use of genetics to identify a person: genetic fingerprinting.\n\n= I Special case of identification of a person by genetic fingerprinting = This may be the case, for example, in forensic medicine, in order to identify the body of a deceased person, or for a paternity search.\nThis may be the case, for example, in forensic medicine, in order to identify the body of a deceased person, or for a paternity search.\n\nUnder the terms of the law, identification can only be sought in three contexts.\n\n== A First Framework ==\n\n\nFirstly, identification may be sought as part of an investigation or enquiry carried out in the course of legal proceedings or for the purpose of establishing the identity of a deceased person when the person's identity is unknown.\n\nGenetic fingerprint identification can only be carried out on the instructions of a magistrate and in a laboratory approved for this purpose. In addition, they may only be carried out by natural or legal persons registered on a list of experts.\n\nThe individual's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out, after the individual has been duly informed of its nature and purpose.\n\nUnless the person gives their express consent during their lifetime, no identification by genetic fingerprinting can be carried out after their death.\n\nThe premises used for storing seals, biological samples and test results must be equipped with facilities to ensure :\n\n* protection against theft or damage;\n* absolute confidentiality;\n* protection of seals, samples and test results.\n\n== B Second frame\n\n\nSecondly, identification may be sought through so-called paternity tests, carried out during legal proceedings.\n\nThese tests are only authorised as part of legal proceedings to establish or contest parentage and/or to obtain or withdraw subsidies.\n\nThe presumed father's consent is required (consent obtained expressly beforehand). The paternity test is ordered by a judge of the Tribunal de Grande Instance. Conducting a paternity test outside this framework is illegal.\n\nThe test is carried out using two methods: comparative examination of blood samples and identification by genetic fingerprinting. The conditions governing the locations and persons authorised to carry out these tests are based on the same approval rules as those mentioned above.\n\n== C Third frame\n\n\nLastly, identification may be sought under the terms of the French National Defence Code, i.e. to identify people who have died in combat, people captured by the armed forces, or people for whom there are specific and serious reasons to believe that they pose a threat to the security of the armed forces or civilian populations.\n\nWhen the identity search concerns a member of the armed forces who has died during an operation conducted by the armed forces, a victim of a natural disaster, or a person whose death is presumed to be the subject of security-related research, samples for the purpose of collecting the biological traces of this person may be taken in places that this person is likely to have frequented habitually, with the agreement of the person in charge of the premises or, if this person refuses or if it is impossible to obtain this agreement, with the authorisation of the liberty and custody judge of the district court. Samples for the same purposes may also be taken from the ascendants, descendants or presumed collateral relatives of this person. The express consent of each person concerned is then obtained in writing before the sample is taken, after they have been duly informed of the nature of the sample, its purpose and the fact that their consent may be revoked at any time. The consent must state the purpose of the sampling and identification.\n\n= II The most common case of examination of a person's genetic characteristics in the context of healthcare or medical research = When identification is carried out for medical or scientific research purposes, the person's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out.\nWhen the identification is carried out for medical or scientific research purposes, the person's express consent must be obtained in writing before the identification is carried out, after the person has been duly informed of its nature and purpose. The consent must state the purpose of the identification. It may be revoked without formality at any time.\n\nThe purpose of this analysis is to :\n\n* either to establish, confirm or rule out the diagnosis of a genetic disease in a person ;\n* search for the characteristics of one or more genes likely to be at the origin of the development of a disease in a person or in the members of his or her family potentially concerned (enabling, for example, the implementation of a genetic counselling approach aimed at developing a prevention, screening or care programme for a person and possibly his or her relatives);\n* or to adapt the medical treatment of a person according to their genetic characteristics (in particular targeted therapies, for example in cancerology according to the genetic characteristics of the tumour).\n\nThe prescription and performance of an examination of a person's genetic characteristics for medical purposes, as well as the specific procedures for appropriate genetic consultations, are governed by rules of good practice defined by order of the Minister for Health. These rules are as follows:\n\n* the requirement for the patient's initial consent, obtained in writing and preceded by full information on the objectives, consequences and limitations of the test;\n* the fact that the person may refuse to be informed of the result of the genetic test;\n* the fact that the person is obliged to inform the members of his or her family in the event of the diagnosis of a serious genetic anomaly likely to require preventive or therapeutic measures (this is known as informing relatives). The law also specifies that if the person does not wish to inform the members of their family themselves, they may ask the doctor who carried out the examination to provide this information, while preserving the patient's anonymity.\n\nThere is one particular situation in which the tests are part of a couple's pregnancy plan. There are two possible situations in which tests may be carried out:\n\n* to carry out a diagnosis on the foetus in utero: this is known as prenatal diagnosis (PND), the aim of which is to detect a particularly serious condition before birth, so that the parents can be offered treatment for the unborn child, or help them prepare to welcome the child, or in some cases to terminate the pregnancy;\n* before the embryo is implanted: this is known as pre-implantation diagnosis (PGD). This technique only concerns couples at high risk of a serious and incurable genetic disease, who use medically assisted procreation, in this case in vitro fertilisation (IVF), to achieve their pregnancy plans. The principle is to identify healthy embryos during IVF, so that embryos carrying the disease are not transferred in utero. In France, only around fifty couples undergo this procedure each year.\n\n= III Discussion of the ethical issues involved in predictive genetics =\n\n== A Prediction: a major impact on life, liberty and fundamental human rights ==\n\n\nPredictive testing is far from a neutral medical act: the result is either a 'conviction' or a 'release'.\n\nPresymptomatic genetic diagnosis can be beneficial when, if abnormality(ies) are revealed, earlier monitoring, screening and treatment can be proposed to limit the expression of the disease and its severity (e.g. more frequent mammograms, MRI, colonoscopies, in familial forms of breast, ovarian or colon cancer).\n\nThe test also has a real benefit for potential carriers, when the test results come back normal, i.e. with no different risk from the general population, thus sparing them the inconvenience of regular, painful and anxiety-provoking monitoring.\n\nHowever, for certain diseases, the medical benefit of pre-symptomatic diagnosis appears to be nil, given the current state of knowledge, in terms of the health of the individual who has undergone the test, as there is no treatment that can prevent or delay the onset of symptoms.\n\nHowever, the benefit can be assessed in other ways:\n\n* a direct individual benefit other than medical (ability to act and make decisions about the course and organisation of one's life);\n* a social benefit (preparation for the illness and adjustment of working conditions);\n* a family benefit (reorganisation of the family plan, dynamics of the couple in the face of the result, possibility of informing the children and other members of the family who may also be affected).\n\nIn all cases, in the context of a parental project, knowledge of the risk borne by the couple and potentially transmissible to a child has a major impact on the way in which the couple organise and medicalise this pregnancy project, and whether or not to continue it. The discovery of foetal anomalies can change the way the pregnancy or birth is managed, and can sometimes lead to discussions about whether or not to continue the pregnancy.\n\nQuestions arise on several levels:\n\n* first level: this focuses on the effect of this information on the individual himself and on his relationships with those around him, and brings into play one of the major principles of bioethics: the autonomy of the subject, i.e. his ability to determine his own life freely. Will this predictive information be able to give individuals greater freedom or, on the contrary, will it lock them into a future that they can only endure? This question remains open;\n* second level: this relates to the risk of information being used by third parties to discriminate in social life, with a risk of weakening social cohesion, justice and solidarity. This can have repercussions in terms of fears of exclusion (professional, family, insurance, etc.) There is therefore a major risk that such information will be misused if it leaves the sphere of the doctor-patient relationship and medical confidentiality. The confidentiality that underpins the contract of care between doctor and patient is an imperative here, as elsewhere. We shall see, however, that there can be a strong tension between the strict respect for confidentiality that may be desired by the person in whom a mutation has been discovered and the possible, sometimes major, interest of other genetically related family members in knowing this information for their own personal benefit. This is the subject of today's debate on the question of informing relatives.\n\nFor all these reasons, our law provides a framework for this practice, to ensure respect for fundamental human rights:\n\n* the explicit consent of the individual is required;\n* use is strictly limited to the medical sphere;\n* medical confidentiality must be respected.\n\nMultidisciplinary teams wishing to carry out pre-symptomatic diagnoses must have clinical and genetic expertise and be registered with the Agence de biom\u00e9decine.\n\nThe rules of good practice concerning genetic testing highlight the ethical principles that must be respected:\n\n* respect for the individual and his or her autonomy, which implies that the applicant is of full age, voluntary, not subject to any pressure or influence from a third party, and in full intellectual capacity. The person is free not to know if this is their choice: this choice must be respected in all circumstances;\n* respect for the applicant's freedom, based on an informed and enlightened choice, authenticated by the signature of his/her consent after objective and up-to-date information from the doctors, and by his/her understanding of the disease, its prognosis, the biological test, its limits and his/her anticipation of the individual and family psychological implications that this test could have, requiring time for reflection;\n* the principle of justice and equality, i.e. that the test should be accessible to everyone without bias. The principle of justice also guarantees non-discrimination; this is achieved through professional secrecy, which is a general guideline in medicine, and a vital principle in the context of genetics, especially as it involves not just an individual but an entire family. This means ensuring that this information is not used by third parties, such as insurers or employers;\n* the principle of beneficence (the person must be able to benefit from the test) or non-maleficence, with the doctor's concern not to harm the person. This harmful aspect is possible when, beyond an announcement, there is no prevention or cure available. This raises the question of the right not to know.\n\n== B The collective dimension of genetic data and the ethical issues involved in informing relatives ==\n\n\nIn the case of genetic diseases, information about the risk does not just concern the person who has undergone the test and knows the result. It may also concern other genetically related family members, because if they are also carriers, they and their doctor can decide on appropriate measures.\n\nNot receiving such information may be perceived as a loss of opportunity. Silence (i.e. the absolute preservation of medical secrecy) towards relatives of a person carrying a genetic disease for which preventive or curative measures exist raises first and foremost the question of moral responsibility towards others.\n\nThis question raises the question of who owns genetic medical information, given that it may reflect the state of health of several individuals in addition to a single source patient. The question is therefore whether genetic information remains strictly personal or individual data.\n\nA dilemma or conflict of interest arises when the protection of a fundamental individual right (the right to secrecy) runs counter to the interests of others. This is the debate between individual and collective responsibility, and the doctor is at the heart of this debate, since he is acting in the interests of his patient, but also in the collective interest, as a player in prevention and public health.\n\nThe value of knowing about the condition affecting one of the family members lies in the fact that for certain diseases (e.g. cancer, metabolic diseases, etc.), there are preventive treatments or monitoring with early diagnosis that can prevent the onset of the disease or improve the individual's prognosis, or even in some cases prevent death. The disclosure of information covered by medical confidentiality may therefore be justified.\n\nThis process of disclosure is designed to achieve a benevolent medical objective, with the aim of improving the health of individuals; it is easy to subscribe to as long as the patient is well informed and supports it.\n\nA woman carrying a genetic risk, for example of breast cancer, may wish to reveal certain information to members of her family, but this may also be difficult for her for various reasons. She may be unwilling or unable to disclose to others because of complex family histories, breakdowns or psychological or socio-behavioural impossibilities. It should be emphasised here that the greater the number of people to be contacted, the greater the complexity for the patient. Some people do not want to announce the misfortune of others (\"the bird of ill omen\"). Others have doubts about the willingness of others to receive this information. As a result, contacting family members yourself with a sensitive health announcement can be an impossible task.\n\nChanges in the bioethics laws have enabled progress to be made in these situations. The doctor may disclose certain information with the patient's consent, but only under certain conditions.\n\n\nPrior to carrying out an examination of a person's genetic characteristics, the prescribing doctor shall inform the person of the risks that silence would entail for the members of his or her family potentially concerned if a serious genetic anomaly were diagnosed, the consequences of which are likely to require preventive measures, including genetic counselling, or care. In a written document, the doctor and the person concerned agree how the potentially affected family members are to be informed. If the person does not wish to inform the family members potentially concerned themselves, they may ask the prescribing doctor, in a written document attesting to this request, to provide this information. To this end, the patient provides the doctor with the contact details of those concerned. The doctor then informs them of the existence of medical information of a family nature which may concern them and invites them to attend a genetic consultation, without disclosing the name of the person who has undergone the examination, the genetic anomaly or the associated risks.\n\nThese provisions follow on from opinion no. 76 of 24 April 2003 of the French National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), which reiterated the need for strict respect for medical confidentiality while informing patients of the risks they would be exposing their family members to by remaining silent. These guidelines provide a response to some of the difficulties outlined above, and help patients in the always delicate process of informing their families.\n\n\nKey points\n\nIt is only possible to identify a person by genetic fingerprinting:\n\n* as part of an investigation or enquiry carried out in the course of legal proceedings,\n* for medical or scientific research purposes,\n* for the purpose of establishing the identity of deceased persons when the identity is unknown,\n* under the conditions set out in article L.2381-1 of the French Defence Code.\n\nUnless the person gives their express consent during their lifetime, no identification by genetic fingerprint can be carried out after their death.\n\nIn the case of a genetic disease, the doctor prescribing a genetic characteristics test informs the patient of the risks that silence would entail for potentially affected family members.\n\nTogether with the patient, the doctor will draw up a written document setting out the arrangements for providing information to family members who may be affected.\n<br />",

The collegial procedure may be requested by the doctor, the medical team, or by the family and close friends on the basis of any advance directives they may have. The final decision rests with the doctor, who must give reasons for the decision and record it in the patient's medical file. The procedure involves consultation between the doctor in charge of the patient and at least one other outside doctor who acts as a consultant. They must be consulted and listened to, even if their requests cannot always be met. The procedure seeks to establish the person's wishes \"by examining\" the advance directives or, failing that, by the testimony of the trusted support person, or failing that, by that of the family or one of the patient's close friends. The main situations in which the law requires recourse to this procedure prior to any decision are unreasonable obstinacy and deep and continuous sedation until death (DCSD).\n\nEthical issues. Clinical situations are often complex and uncertain. A poor prognosis or the risk of death should not necessarily lead to the implementation of deep and continuous sedation, even if active treatments are stopped. Preventive\" deep and continuous sedation is not a systematic response. It is important to look at other medicinal and non-medicinal alternatives to respond to the suffering of patients by adapting care as closely as possible to their requests and needs.\n\nThe CCNE (opinion 139 published on 13 September 2022) emphasises two fundamental principles that must be reconciled: the \"duty of solidarity\" towards the most vulnerable, and \"respect for the autonomy of the individual\". Ethical deliberation is about assessing the value of the right to life. If the right to life is given a supreme and indisputable value, any compromise is unthinkable. The debate is closed. If respect for the \"right to life\" does not amount to a \"duty to live\" a life deemed unbearable by the person living it, then there is no obligation to live. The debate remains open.\n\n''Good practice''. \"The collegial procedure must always consist of a deliberative process and not be reduced to its procedural dimension. In this spirit, each participant in this collegial procedure must be able to argue and then debate within an interdisciplinary consultation, without ranking the arguments according to the role of the professionals present. Each person's position must be able to evolve under the influence of the arguments of others to arrive at a fair and proportionate assessment in the interests of the person being cared for. This process requires a wide range of skills, time and availability. It must be recorded in writing in the patient's medical record\" (p. 22).",

At the same time, the concept was incorporated into the Criminal Code, providing special protection for certain victims on the basis of physical and psychological criteria (such as age, illness or infirmity), as well as economic and social criteria (such as dependence due to extreme hardship) specific to the victim. Today, it is all the more widely used, including in politics and the media, and as a result helps to shape our relationship with others and the world.\n\nLike the concepts of risk and precariousness, with which it is often associated, the notion of vulnerability has become an essential part of the humanities and social sciences for understanding people in their social and psychological experience, and the world in which they live, which is considered to be increasingly vulnerable. In today's increasingly high-tech societies, where disasters are already part of our reality, our vulnerability is intensified by the ambivalence between our heightened awareness of risks and the impossibility of controlling them all, whereas since the 19th century, thanks in particular to the development of medicine and social protection systems, we thought we were in a position to deal with the 'problem' of our vulnerability [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>]].\n\n\n'''Two definitions of vulnerability, to be considered together:'''\n\nIn the human and social sciences, there are two main definitions of vulnerability:\n\n- Vulnerability as a constituent of human existence, universally shared, sometimes qualified as fundamental or ontological vulnerability, and which refers to our anthropological and biological fragility. A human existence affected by illness, loss and distress.\n\n- Vulnerability is dependent on particular historical and social contexts, and is often referred to as social vulnerability. It is the subject of a great deal of work in sociology, which identifies multiple vulnerabilities that affect different realities or populations in given socio-historical configurations. It concerns groups or individuals who are considered to be vulnerable because they have few economic resources, a very precarious employment status, a lack of social support or networks, or obstacles to social integration (isolated elderly people, people who are unemployed, people with precarious employment contracts, people with physical or mental disabilities, people without qualifications, people who do not have access to certain rights, etc.). However, care must be taken not to reduce these groups and individuals to their vulnerability, at the risk of turning them into a stigmatising category. All the more so as this vulnerability, like the notion of precariousness, can have a negative social connotation and be perceived as the responsibility of the individuals themselves, who would also be a burden on others through the assistance measures put in place by society and from which they may benefit. Sociologist Serge Paugam, using the concept of social disqualification, looks at the experiences and views of people living in precarious and poor conditions, whose social status is devalued and who feel a humiliation that often forces them to isolate themselves [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote3sym|<sup>3</sup>]].\n\nSocial vulnerability is also considered in a more dynamic way, as the effect of a recent historical process of undermining the wage-earning system and the move towards more globalised capitalism. The society of the twentieth century, characterised by a solid wage-earning condition (guaranteeing social rights, lasting protection against the hazards of life, social independence and integration, and membership of work collectives), is crumbling to the benefit of decollectivisation and re-individualisation, as well as a neo-liberal discourse that appeals to the imperatives of responsibility, initiative and autonomy. Individuals who do not have, or who have only limited social and economic resources, experience downgrading, dependence on social assistance, low self-esteem and permanent insecurity: \"individuals by default\" who lack the real possibility of being individuals [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote4sym|<sup>4</sup>]]. Robert Castel introduces the term disaffiliation, which has a dynamic logic, to understand the trajectory, in successive stages, of vulnerable groups and individuals (job insecurity; unemployment; then long-term unemployment, with a gradual disintegration of social relations). This new society, which is shaking up the whole social structure, is producing a vulnerability experienced by more and more people (inability to plan ahead and control the future, which requires stability in the present, uncertainty and constant fear of loss, feelings of powerlessness, lack of recognition: all factors which help to explain why these people pay less attention to their health, have less recourse to preventive examinations and find it more difficult to consult socially integrated and recognised health professionals).\n\nWhile fundamental vulnerability and social vulnerability are often dissociated, many authors, including Robert Castel, invite us to think of them together, considering vulnerability as both a universal condition and a potential that can affect everyone, individually, in a different or unequal way due to its relational and contextual dimensions, dimensions on which it is possible to act to reduce it, also making reversibility one of its characteristics. For Castel, we must seek to \"establish a system of strict correspondences between what a social subject experiences in the depths of his personal experience and the conditions imposed on him by his historical period and his social position. Not in order to reduce individual subjectivity to objective determinations, but on the contrary to show that the burdens of history and social constraints are internalised by the subjects that we are, to the point of constituting the fabric of our most personal affects\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote5sym|<sup>5</sup>]].\n\n'''The ethics of care''''' :\n\nVulnerability is at the heart of care ethics, which have highlighted the epistemological, ethical and political issues involved in the mobilisation and use of this concept. Care\" thinking emerged in the United States in the 1970s, with the seminal work of Carol Gilligan and Joan Tronto [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote6sym|<sup>6</sup>]]. It became established in France in the 2000s, where the choice was made to retain the Anglo-Saxon term, which refers to a network of meanings not found in a single French term. For Vanessa Nurock, translating the notion of care as \"soin\" or \"sollicitude\" is insufficient, and even erroneous, because it misses what makes care original, namely a novel combination of things that are found elsewhere separately: \"Care refers simultaneously to a feeling (solicitude), to sensitivity, to an activity (lavishing attention or care), to a position (taking to heart), to a relationship with the other (active altruism) and with oneself (without abnegation). This is why the main translations used to characterise \"care\" as \"ethics of solicitude\" or \"ethics of care\" are not sufficient, particularly because they place \"care\" either on the side of an ethical attitude (solicitude) or on the side of a concrete activity (care). But 'care' is precisely both an attitude and an activity\". Vanessa Nurock adds that \"one of the ways to account for the thought of 'care' is perhaps to make explicit what it is not, what it reacts to, to see 'care' as the negation of its negation: the opposite of 'I don't care', i.e. 'I don't care', or 'I don't concern myself with it', or it doesn't concern me\". The ethic of care is defined as a reaction to invisibilisation and indifference [[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote7sym|<sup>7</sup>]].\n\nSo care is not just an ethical attitude in the intimate relationship between two people, it also has a public and political dimension: the ethics of care make demands, because it calls into question a hierarchy based on male domination that has long devalued care, reducing it to the care and concern for children and elderly parents provided exclusively by women and referring to charity and sacrifice.  \n\nSeveral notions are fundamental to care thinking. People must be understood in their singularity (the healthcare professional must hear and consider multiple points of view, specific to each person, and sometimes quite different from his or her own) and in their relationships. The care ethic emphasises what links people together, their dependencies and their interdependencies: \"the care ethic is an approach that assumes our interconnectedness with others, relationships of dependency, without promoting sacrifice and self-denial\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote8sym|<sup>8</sup>]]. These relationships of care and dependence must be extended to institutions, by looking at how we care for others through the institutions that link us (medicine being practised within institutions) and how we care for these institutions [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote9sym|<sup>9</sup>]].\n\nThe ethics of \"care\" remind us that dependence and vulnerability concern everyone and are experienced in varying circumstances and to varying degrees, since the human condition is by nature based on links of interdependence. They criticise the way our world is structured around the myth of autonomy, or at least a certain conception of autonomy, that of the rational subject who is master of his own destiny and life, the entrepreneur of his own existence and free, because he is capable of deciding for himself by using his reason and expressing his will.\n\nHowever, they do not consider vulnerability to be a defect or a lack of autonomy, even though it is commonly associated, in current representations, with dependence or loss of autonomy, i.e. a state or situation against which it is necessary to protect oneself or take action in order not to lose or regain the status of an autonomous subject, and if the subject is unable to take action because he or she is too vulnerable, it is necessary to do so in his or her place. If vulnerability is misunderstood, it can be used to justify paternalistic public policies and care and intervention measures for groups designated as vulnerable, at the risk of stigmatising them. In the name of benevolence, we multiply the categories of vulnerable people (children, patients, the elderly, disadvantaged groups, etc.) to make them the targets of policies that often mask the relationships of domination and relegation of those who embody the vulnerability we are trying to distance, master and control. It is the same human being who is both autonomous and vulnerable, according to Paul Ric\u0153ur [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote10sym|<sup>10</sup>]]. So vulnerability is not a negative condition in that it prevents or hinders autonomy, but the normal condition of living beings, the common ground of our humanity rethought in terms of weakness and dependence. In this way, a new paradigm is developing that challenges an anthropology that draws on the register of risk, control and power, and for which vulnerability is a problem, a failure or the mark of powerlessness. It is based on an anthropology that sees human beings as both capable and vulnerable, autonomous and vulnerable.\n\n'''Vulnerability in medicine:''''\n\nIn medicine and in the field of medical ethics, the notion of vulnerability is immediately associated with illness. This is because it alters the general state of the person who has to cope with the intrusion of medical examinations, overcome the upheaval associated with the announcement of the diagnosis, accept the treatments and their consequences, assume the injunction to autonomy, i.e. to be a 'good patient' who is informed, consents and co-decides on his or her care, while enduring the physical pain and moral suffering associated with the disease.\n\nThus, medical practice, at least until recently and to some extent still today, is part of a tradition of caring for individuals made vulnerable by illness, within the framework of a doctor-patient relationship conceived as profoundly asymmetrical, hence the development of and criticism levelled at so-called \"paternalistic\" medicine, which treats patients as if they were children or people incapable of exercising their rights normally and needing to be protected and helped by professionals with the necessary skills and the ability to make the right decisions.\n\nAlthough medical paternalism is largely a thing of the past, the fact remains that doctors are regularly confronted with situations where their patients do not seem to be able to exercise their rights and assert their autonomy. In fact, certain pathological conditions seem to deprive patients of any ability to reason or express their wishes: intense pain, withdrawal caused by certain addictions, extremely diminished and very weak patients, patients in chronic neurovegetative coma, certain dementias or pauci-relational states, certain end-of-life situations or serious chronic illnesses, etc. In these situations, the decision as to what should be done should be delegated to the medical team and/or relatives, in the patient's interest, and if recovery is a possible goal, until the patient can regain a decision-making role. The delegation of decision-making is therefore provisional, the aim being to put an end to the condition that has led to decisions being taken in the patient's place, where possible. Obviously, certain more complex situations do not allow the patient's decision-making role to be restored, but require the patient's support to be considered in the light of his or her wishes - when these are known through advance directives or the testimony of relatives - without it being possible to update them.\n\nHowever, vulnerability is not simply the mark of an inability to be autonomous that concerns only others. One of the contributions of the ethics of 'care' is to have reversed the meaning of the term, making it into a more positive vision of a relational capacity or disposition, in this case essential in the care relationship. What is often overlooked, or even 'unthought of' according to Agatha Zielinski, is the vulnerability of the carer and the fact that the caring relationship is first and foremost an encounter between two vulnerabilities, Common representations and expressions such as 'taking charge' of the patient suggest that there is only one vulnerable being in this relationship - the patient, whose existence is reduced to the condition of being sick, exposed to illness, pain and suffering, even death, but also to the intrusion of care and the action of carers. But the carer is also vulnerable in that he or she is exposed to and affected by the patient's suffering, placing the care relationship within a reciprocal and intersubjective framework that underpins its ethical dimension and leads the carer, assigned responsibility, to act to relieve suffering: this is the object of solicitude.\n\nBut the carer's concern is not just about meeting the needs of the suffering and incapacitated patient, it is also about considering the patient as a capable subject, \"always capable - and in this sense, always worthy of esteem\" [[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote11sym|<sup>11</sup>]], and calling on their resources, desires and willpower so that they remain an active subject in the face of illness and not just a victim of it.\n\n\n[[Conna\u00eetre la d\u00e9finition de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text is a revised version of Grandazzi G., \"Du risque au fondement du soin : r\u00e9flexions sur la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''Regards humanistes sur le droit, M\u00e9langes en l'honneur de la Professeure Annick Batteur'', Paris, LGDJ, Lextenso \u00e9ditions , 2021, pp. 143-153.\n\n[[Know the definition of vulnerability OIC-009-09-B#sdfootnote2anc|2]] Brodiez-Dolino A, \"Le concept de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9\", ''La Vie des id\u00e9es'', online 11 February 2016.

Autonomy, information and consent'''\n\nToday, as a result of the democratisation of our healthcare system and patients' desire to share access to medical knowledge, their demand to participate in the care process is growing, raising the question of the need to provide them with quality information, to obtain their consent and therefore to respect their freedom of choice. As a result, medical practice has become a field in which respect for patient autonomy is now central, through patient participation in the decisions that concern them, recognised as a right (when this is not made impossible by a state of great vulnerability, an emergency or a loss of psychological autonomy linked to the illness).\n\nThe principle of autonomy stems philosophically from the period of so-called modern philosophy in the 17th century, which prefigured the philosophy of the Enlightenment in the 18th century. In his Discourse on Method, Descartes asserted the sovereignty of the mind over the body. This is the condition of freedom. This condition, which enables every person to judge what is right or good for them, is based on the act of the mind. The subject's autonomy can then be understood as the individual freedom to have singular preferences through internal deliberation based on a capacity for analysis. In the sense of Jean Jacques Rousseau, this translates into a social contract, where individuals acquire rights within the framework of the common law, these rights allowing freedom of thought, freedom of belief and freedom to choose one's destiny.\n\nIn the field of healthcare, the application of such an area of patient freedom has historically been ignored. For a very long time, medical decisions were taken without the patient's consent, or even without informing him or her.  This attitude was described as paternalistic, and since the 1970s there has been a legitimate demand to involve patients in the choices that concern them. According to Nilstum's definition, paternalism consisted of treating others in accordance with what was considered to be the good of others, rarely subordinating to this good any preferences, whether expressed or not, of these others. In clinical practice today, recognition of patient autonomy is reflected in a shared construction of the medical decision. This approach is commonly referred to as the co-decision process. It is based on the recognition of autonomy and is developed through an approach that now requires healthcare providers to inform and take into account the patient's questions, wishes and values.\n\nThis autonomy must be recognised, but sometimes it cannot be considered an absolute, either because the patient is losing his autonomy and therefore his ability to analyse and make decisions, or because the demands he might make in the name of his freedom cannot be reconciled with the values or organisation of our healthcare system or our society.\n\nPrior to any diagnostic or therapeutic approach, respect for patient autonomy must be reflected in a duty to provide information before obtaining consent. Consent that is not preceded by high-quality information is not legitimate.\n\nThis respect for patient autonomy has been enshrined in French legislation, first in a law governing biomedical research in 1988, and then in the bioethics laws since 1994. These laws address the issue of information and consent in specific cases, such as biomedical research, organ donation, medically assisted procreation and genetic testing, all areas in which information and consent must be given and collected in writing. Then, in 2002, the law on patients' rights and the quality of the healthcare system, known as the law of 4 March 2002, recognised the right to information and consent in all healthcare practices.\n\nPatients need, and have the right, to be informed about the choice of examinations or treatments that concern them first and foremost in their body and in their experience, because they concern their life and their conception of it. Patients should be provided with all the information they need to make their own choices, as it is ultimately up to them to decide whether or not to exercise their autonomy.\n\nAt the heart of these developments lies the way in which patients are informed. This issue is unquestionably at the heart of the notion of professional responsibility and the way in which we conceive of a patient's autonomy. The more complete the information provided, including all the uncertainties and doubts, the more the professional reinforces the patient's autonomy of decision, even if this means making the path to the patient's choice more complex. So providing information is not neutral.\n\nThe information process relies on the patient's ability to understand the medical discourse. Here we can really talk about \"understanding\", in the etymological sense of the term: the patient \"takes with him\" the information he is given, confronts it with his own experiences and fears, and gives a picture of his illness with which he can live and which will form the basis of his dialogue with the doctor.\n\nThe duty to inform therefore covers two levels:\n\n- the first is ethical, where patient autonomy in the healthcare relationship is increasingly recognised and promoted as the democratic basis for respecting and protecting individuals;\n\n- the second is of a legal nature, resulting in the obligation to provide high-quality information to enable patients to accept or refuse treatment in an informed manner.\n\nIn practice, as far as the form of information is concerned, it should above all be given orally by the healthcare professional, who should take the time necessary to ensure that each patient understands it properly, depending on their condition and difficulties. This can be helped by providing the patient with appropriate educational documents. Apart from the specific cases provided for by law (organ donation in the case of a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.\n\nTo achieve this, quality information must meet a number of objectives:\n\n   - ensure that information is provided in accordance with the principles of transparency and integrity, based on current scientific and medical data;\n\n   - inform the patient about the benefits and risks, based on validated data and, where appropriate, setting out the areas of uncertainty;\n\n   - Over and above the benefits and risks, shed light on :\n\n   - the course of care,\n\n   - physical and psychological inconvenience in everyday life,\n\n   - the organisation of the care pathway over time and the organisational constraints involved,\n\n   - the social rights of the sick person and the help and support available if necessary;\n\n   - participate in the choice between two or more medical approaches when they are validated alternatives compatible with the patient's situation.\n\n\n      II. Refusal of care''\n\nEthical debate about refusing care is fairly frequent within teams, and sometimes the concept of autonomy on which the patient's attitude is based raises questions. A patient's refusal to accept care can offend carers who have been trained to think of their actions in terms of an essential value of care: acting on behalf of others, sometimes in their place, in the name of beneficence. Sometimes, the teams are confronted with situations where refusal appears contrary not only to medical logic, but also to what they consider to be the best interests of the patient. In other circumstances, however, the patient's refusal of care will be in line with the medical team's opinion. This will be the case at the end of life, when the patient asks for care to be limited or discontinued to avoid unreasonable obstinacy; this falls within the scope of the so-called Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law on the end of life, which authorises such procedures.\n\nRefusal of care raises questions about the concept of autonomy.  The clinical context can generate or reveal a loss of autonomy, well beyond the major cases of geriatrics or psychiatry. This raises two questions:\n\n- Trying to determine whether or not the patient's formulation of a refusal is an act of will, based on a capacity for deliberative autonomy, including receiving and understanding information about the nature of the medical proposal and all the consequences of its implementation, but also of its non-implementation.\n\n- Consider whether the patient's word should be accepted as such or not.\n\nIf the patient's words are accepted outright, it is because they are considered to be an acceptable choice (often because the clinical situation and the medical assessment are in line with the wishes expressed by the patient). On the other hand, a patient's refusal may give rise to a care attitude aimed at giving time and not accepting the refusal de facto; this time is then used to provide explanations and discuss the matter again with the patient.\n\nAccepting a refusal of care too easily would be tantamount to denying the dimension of nursing work which is the accompaniment towards acceptance and a shared decision. In many clinical situations, refusal of care is simply a point of call or a clinical sign of psychological deficiency, suffering or despair, all of which it is the mission of medicine to combat so that the patient can get better and live better. The ethical question, then, is how far we are entitled to go in this process, between explaining and convincing, without forcing. In all cases, the question of time is important, because assessing these situations requires a relationship with others and regular, in-depth exchanges between people, which are essential in view of the consequences of the decisions to be taken.\n\nIn this context, medicine finds itself at the heart of an expertise that can guide the fate of individuals. The aim is to analyse the individual's ability to exercise an autonomy that is deemed valid: a formidable task! In practice, a medical team explores a certain number of abilities:\n\n- That the patient understands and integrates the information and understands the consequences of attitudes on his or her life,\n\n- That the subject is endowed with memory (that he can remember) and that he is capable of making a decision, sticking to it and voluntarily maintaining his decision (in the sense of maintaining a will by using reason).\n\nIn clinical terms, this assessment leads to a gradient of situations ranging from major impairment to minor impairment. The question then arises as to what weight each 'non-autonomy' should have in order to accept or not accept that medical teams go beyond the patient's wishes. A reading of the arguments in the ethics of decision making suggests that, in certain situations, the medical decision will be based above all on beneficence, particularly in situations of impaired autonomy. Once this has been established, in order to act in this way we need to consider the grounds for acting against the opinion expressed by the patient:\n\n- The concept of expected benefit (or expected improvement), which is the result of a benefit/risk assessment;\n\n- Implementing an approach that excludes physical violence that is traumatic for the patient and the team;\n\n- Maintaining a relationship that upholds the patient's dignity.\n\nGiven the complexity of this type of decision for a doctor, a carer and an entire team, it is customary to advocate a three-stage medical decision based on the principle of collegiality:\n\na) The time that precedes, and enables the case to be investigated, as in a court of law, in a collegial manner within the framework of an ethic of discussion; this time can be long, and reserves a space for argumentation between a normative level of knowledge and the decision-making level adapted to reality, i.e. to the patient's individual situation. In this context, individual decisions by a single professional should be avoided;\n\nb) The time when the decision must be taken by a clearly designated individual, driven by an \"intimate collective conviction\". Validation of the principles of beneficence, non-maleficence and justice must guide this conviction;\n\nc) The time after the decision, when it is imperative to continue the discussion in order to take responsibility for and monitor developments, to continue or to reconsider.\n\nThis time must be respected and valued in the organisation of care teams.\n\nBut there are situations in which refusing care can be resisted or refused.\n\nFirst of all, we should mention the particular situation of an immediate life-threatening emergency, where the patient may have expressed a refusal of care verbally or, even more so, in writing, even though he or she was not in an end-of-life situation. The classic example is the suicidal patient. There is now a consensus that, in this case, as long as medical action can be taken, it should be, since there is a life-threatening emergency accompanied by impaired discernment.\n\nThus, except in an end-of-life situation where the patient has made his or her choice known orally or via advance directives (living will) or via the trusted support person, the prevailing idea in an emergency situation is that the person should be saved.\n\nThis is easily illustrated, for example, by the case of a young diabetic teenager who, refusing to continue insulin therapy because of a family conflict, ended up in an acid-ketotic coma with a life-threatening prognosis. In an extreme conception of respect for autonomy, we could choose, in all cases, to defer to the patient's choice; But accepting a refusal of care too easily and without debate or questioning would mean denying situations where a patient's verbalisation does not necessarily reflect the complexity of his or her thinking, or even means a cry for help, a request to be listened to differently, for a different way of providing care - all situations where the care provider's job must be to connect the patient to a care approach that is better adapted to his or her situation and which, in the end, will be positive for him or her.\n\nThere is also a final case of refusal of care: that which exposes the other person or raises questions in terms of public health.\n\nMany situations fall into this category: Opposition to vaccinations; refusal to accept prophylactic treatment for meningitis or anti-tuberculosis treatment which may increase the risk to the community, a family or a spouse; refusal of a medically justified caesarean section, which puts the life of the mother or even the child at risk; refusal of an essential transfusion which involves a risk of after-effects, disability or death... In these cases, there is a real conflict of values, with healthcare professionals asserting their decisions on the basis that medical practice cannot be degraded, especially when other interests are at stake beyond the patient's (an unborn child, a family or the community).\n\nThere is also a need for medicine to prevent, treat and provide assistance in a way that is based on the public good, and not on formal respect for individual convictions by which patients mark their differences with the community, possibly to the detriment of themselves and others. An autonomist, individualist approach would legitimise the refusal of vaccinations (although beneficial to the community as a whole, it loses its meaning if not everyone agrees to it), the refusal of a caesarean section because of a mother's choice (to the detriment of the child), the refusal to save the father or mother of a child in the name of a belief or religion (certainly putting at risk the balance of the family but also collective solidarity with those who remain dependent), the refusal of care during serious epidemics (putting at risk the lives of other people), etc.\n\nThus, in a universal understanding of medicine, it is difficult to see patients as having rights but no duties. An autonomist view, taken to the extreme, would respect these endangerments, regarding them as a right and placing the patient in the position of a user, or even a client, imposing his or her choices on the healthcare professional, who is then seen as a service provider. Our analysis should be set against the writings of Hans Georg Gadamer in Philosophy of Health, where he reminds us that the ethics of responsibility can thwart individual convictions, and that the common good is at stake. In the light of his analysis, a healthcare system must be able to define rules and duties applicable to all; in return, everyone receives rights: social protection, equal access to care. What would we say about a system that allowed air travellers to object, on individual grounds, to the landing rules and instruments applied by an airline pilot? If health were to become a simple matter of consumerism governed by such individual choices, far removed from the complex notions we have just set out and the representations of the social bond, then the ethical aim of medicine would have to be redefined. We would then have to ask ourselves whether it would not then be contrary to the ethical aim defined by Paul Ricoeur as \"the aim of the good life, with and for others, in just institutions\".",

What are products and elements of the human body?\nThe \"elements\" of the human body are the organs, tissues and cells of the body. The \"products\" of the human body are renewable: blood and gametes, for example. Fingernails, hair, teeth and hair are called \"phanera\" and are excluded from the scope of the elements and products of the human body discussed here, which refer to three kinds of \"things\":\n\n# Blood and its components, as well as labile blood products.\n# Organs, which can only be \"used\" as part of a donation.\n# Finally, the broader category of tissues or cells, including haematopoietic cells derived from bone marrow, cord blood or placental blood, embryonic or foetal tissues or cells, cord and placental cells, gametes, etc.\n\n== II. What are the principles governing these products and elements of the human body? ==\nAll these products and elements are not vulgar things that can be exploited. But neither are they \"sacralised\". While the human body is in principle fundamentally unavailable (it cannot be alienated), its products and elements sometimes have to be taken to be used, for therapeutic purposes in particular. In a way, therefore, they are available. This availability is governed by three main principles:\n\n* Non-economic ownership: \"The human body, its elements and products cannot be the subject of an economic right\" (Civil Code, art. 16-1). This means that they can never be traded or associated with any price.\n\n* The person's informed consent. The removal of elements from the human body and the collection of its products is subject to the principle of the donor's prior consent, in accordance with the procedures laid down by law (article 1211-2 of the Public Health Code), with nuances and exceptions depending on the situation and the intended purpose. Once the collection or removal has been carried out, the products and elements may be used for purposes other than those initially intended, provided that the person concerned, duly informed, does not object.\n\n* Anonymity: According to article 16-8 of the French Civil Code, \"no information may be divulged that would make it possible to identify both the person who has donated an element or product of his or her body and the person who has received it. The donor may not know the identity of the recipient, nor may the recipient know the identity of the donor. In the event of therapeutic necessity, only the donor's and the recipient's doctors may have access to information enabling them to be identified.\n\nThese principles obviously do not apply in the same way in all cases. For example, \"a transfusion of renewable blood cells with a limited lifespan does not raise the same ethical and reflexive issues and elements as the transplantation of an organ essential to the survival of a recipient, or the aiding of the conception of an individual through the donation of gametes\" (Thibert, 2020).\n\n== III. Ethical issues beyond the legal framework ==\n\n* Elements and products of the human body may be incorporated into biological collections, sometimes known as \"biobanks\", which ensure their conservation and exploitation for scientific purposes or therapeutic innovation. This raises numerous questions about the ownership of samples, the right of withdrawal that donors may or may not exercise, the protection of health data, and the prospect of widespread commercialisation of these elements, for example (Clarizio ''et al''. 2022).\n* For gamete donation for medically assisted procreation (MAP), donor and recipient couples cannot come into contact and know each other's identities. Thus anonymity is initially preserved: the donors and the recipient couple or the single woman recipient can never know each other's identities. However, the 2021 Bioethics Act provides for access to origins for people born from donated gametes or embryos, when they reach the age of majority and if they so request, \"via a national commission\". They will be able to receive information about the donors and/or their identity.\n* In the case of organ removal from the living, consent is obtained after information has been provided on the risks and possible consequences of removal. In the case of \"post-mortem\" removal, consent is reversed (also known as \"presumed consent\"), and presupposes the absence of refusal of such removal, by registration on an automated national register set up for this purpose (see \"Organ donation\" and \"Organ donation and removal from deceased persons\" sheets). This raises ethical issues. Considering \"presumed\" consent as \"genuine\" consent is by no means self-evident, since to consent is to \"agree with\", which implies that you have consciously acquiesced to what you have been offered or asked. To deduce consent to organ donation (the idea of donation also implies an active and personal gesture) from an absence of opposition to the removal poses a problem that the legal framework alone is not sufficient to resolve. Carers cannot therefore take a decision unilaterally on the basis of the law alone. It is essential to open a dialogue with the deceased person's next of kin, all the more so when the deceased person had not explicitly indicated his or her wish to have his or her organs removed \"post mortem\" (possession of a donor card, explicit statements on the subject, etc.).\n\n==== Bibliographical references ====\nClarizio, Emanuele ; Ch\u00e9rici, C\u00e9line ; Dupont, Jean-Claude ; Guchet, Xavier, Herpe, Yves-\u00c9douard.

Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.\n\n- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics\n\n- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal and cardiac complications.\n<br />\n\n=== '''Indications''' ===\n- Fever: low dose\n\n- Pain:\n\no ''Acute pain'': dental pain, ''postoperative pain'', ''post-traumatic pain'', ''headaches'' or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.\n\no Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.\n\n- inflammation: higher dosage\n\nacute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, ''spinal pain'' and ''radicular pain'' and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.\n\n- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.\n\n\n=== '''Contraindications''' ===\n- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.\n\n- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).\n\n- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).\n\n- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.\n\n- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.\n\n- Haemorrhagic diseases.\n\n- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===\nVirtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications.

This is the doctor's right to refuse to carry out a medical act that is authorised by law but that he or she considers contrary to his or her own personal, professional or ethical convictions. This is only possible under certain conditions strictly defined by law.\n\nDoctors may refuse treatment for professional or personal reasons, for example in the event of a disagreement with a patient, aggressive behaviour, or incompetence in view of the specific nature of an illness, etc. However, if they refuse to carry out their mission, they must inform the patient immediately and pass on to the practitioner designated by the patient any information that may be useful in continuing the treatment.\n\nA so-called specific \"conscience clause\", introduced in 1975 by the Veil law on voluntary termination of pregnancy, is the reservation under which a doctor or medical auxiliary may refuse to carry out or assist in a voluntary or medical termination of pregnancy, or sterilisation.\n\nIn certain cases, refusal of treatment is compulsory: in the name of the principle of proportionality, the medical act must pursue a therapeutic necessity and the benefits must outweigh the risks; in the name of legal and ethical obligations, the care envisaged must not exceed the practitioner's competence.\n\nHowever, as a general rule, no one may be discriminated against in access to prevention or care (cf. Code of Medical Ethics, art. 7).\n\nThe Criminal Code makes it an offence to discriminate against people for any reason, including because of their state of health or disability. Any healthcare professional who refuses to provide care to a patient because of his or her origin, sex, family situation, state of health, disability, morals, sexual orientation, age, political opinions, trade union activities, membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion, or detention status, is liable to disciplinary, criminal or civil penalties.\n\nToday, the most numerous cases of direct or indirect discrimination concern patients receiving universal health cover (CMU) or state medical aid (AME). Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>]]\n\n\n'''''Patient refusal of care'''''\n\nA patient's refusal to accept treatment highlights the tension between two fundamental ethical principles: the \"principle of beneficence\", which requires that the patient should not be harmed and that the patient should benefit, and the \"principle of autonomy\", which requires that the patient's wishes should be respected.\n\nThe patient's rights, first and foremost the right to respect for his or her wishes, make the issue of refusal of care by the patient particularly acute: \"Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote2sym|<sup>2</sup>\". According to a paternalistic conception of medicine, the patient, made vulnerable by his suffering, cannot conceive of or decide on his own good. If the patient refuses care, there is a risk that it will only express his distress, and not his rational and autonomous will. He should therefore be protected from himself. On the other hand, according to a conception of medicine based on the principle of autonomy, refusal of care is an expression of the will of a person who, despite his or her illness, remains entitled to make the decisions that concern him or her.\n\nThe law of 4 March 2002 on patients' rights and the quality of the healthcare system reflects the search for a compromise between the principle of beneficence and the principle of autonomy.\n\nIt places the person's consent at the heart of any act of care. The person must be informed of his/her state of health, the care proposed and the consequences of any refusal of care on his/her state of health [[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote3sym|<sup>3</sup>]]. He/she has the right to have his/her wishes respected by consenting to investigations and care or by refusing them, even if this refusal involves a risk to his/her health or life[[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote4sym|<sup>4</sup>]]. The refusal must be repeated and recorded in the medical record. When the person is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, no intervention or investigation may be carried out, except in an emergency or when it is impossible, without the trusted support person, the family or, failing this, a close relative having been consulted. The consent of the minor or adult under guardianship must be sought, even if the agreement of the person with parental authority or the guardian is necessary. However, if refusing treatment could have serious consequences for the health of the minor or person under guardianship, the doctor will provide the necessary treatment.\n\nThe law reveals a tension. It promotes a model of concerted, joint decision, taken by mutual agreement between the doctor and the patient: the doctor, in the light of his or her skills, gives an opinion on the condition and the therapeutic plan, and the patient, in the light of the medical proposals, makes a choice. It is \"with the healthcare professional\" that decisions are made. Nevertheless, the doctor must do everything in his power to convince the patient to accept essential care if his life is in danger - which calls into question respect for the patient's wishes. If there is a life-threatening emergency and the doctor is unable to convince the patient of the need for treatment, he or she cannot be accused of providing treatment against the patient's will. Case law subordinates the principle of respect for the patient's wishes to the principle of preservation of life in cases of refusal of blood transfusion, in an emergency situation, by Jehovah's Witnesses. Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote5sym|<sup>5</sup>]]\n\nUltimately, refusal of care is expressed when people who are at the end of life or not [[Refusal of care OIC-009-07-A#sdfootnote6sym|<sup>6</sup>]] and who are subject to extreme physical and/or mental suffering, refuse treatment and life support and ask to be helped to die.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti Act of 2016 provides a partial response to this problem. It attempts to place the patient at the heart of the decision-making process. It prohibits unreasonable obstinacy. It obliges doctors to respect patients' wishes to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness. It affirms the patient's right to benefit from deep and continuous sedation until death when the prognosis is vital in the short term. It makes advance directives binding on doctors. In the absence of advance directives, account must be taken of the patient's wishes, as expressed by the trusted support person or, failing this, by close relatives.\n\nStopping treatment does not mean stopping care, nor does it call into question the caring nature of medicine, defined by concern for the sick person. Whereas treatment combats the disease and its effects, care - which is based on the treatment(s) - responds to the fundamental, global and individual needs of the vulnerable person, who is not only alive, but also feeling, suffering, thinking and involved in social relationships.\n\nFrom an ethical point of view, a refusal of treatment cannot be considered as a refusal of care. Hearing and respecting refusal of treatment is part of the care activity and obliges us to take care. Care requires an understanding of the diversity of situations in which treatment is refused (emergency situations requiring, for example, a blood transfusion or a caesarean section, heavy therapies such as chemotherapy, refusal of treatment in psychiatry, at the end of life, refusal of treatment for pregnant women, etc.) and the diversity of the reasons behind it: religious beliefs, cultural representations and values, social conditions, life concepts and projects, etc. Respecting patient autonomy does not mean submitting passively to a conscience that may be altered by suffering or depression. It means maintaining the ability to listen, understand and relate that can help to bring about a truly autonomous will and find an individualised solution. Guided by concern, the care relationship maintains the cared-for person in the exchange, sharing and community of human beings.

In clinical practice, we sometimes experience the difficulty of providing information, particularly when faced with highly distressed patients, where the truth is difficult to tell and some patients are unable to bear it. Some former doctors used to quote St Thomas to justify not informing a patient: \"Man prefers a lie to the truth. Man prefers a lie to the truth that enlightens\". But apart from exceptional cases, this type of approach is a thing of the past. We believe that every patient has the right to know, so that they can participate in the organisation of their care pathway, but also so that they can organise their lives accordingly, in terms of both day-to-day aspects and fundamental choices. Providing information is a complex process but, like any medical skill, it can be learned. This learning process includes both the way in which the information is delivered and the way in which the patient is supported during the process, with a humanistic and psychological approach.\n\nThe law gives this development an additional dimension by placing information and consent within a contractual framework designed to assess the quality of medical practice, particularly in the event of conflict. Questions of the quality and completeness of information are part of this framework.\n\nHowever, a rare case should be mentioned: the wish not to know. This may constitute an exception to the patient's duty to inform if he or she has clearly expressed (data and arguments which must be noted in the medical record) the wish to be kept in the dark about a serious diagnosis or prognosis, or even about any information concerning his or her health and treatment. However, legal and ethical rules specify that this exception does not apply when third parties are exposed to a risk of contamination. This clarification, inspired by the case of AIDS, applies to all serious contagious diseases and is necessary because of the patient's responsibility towards others and in the interests of public health.\n\n== How far to inform: the question of serious or exceptional risks'' ==\nTwo types of situation may arise in medical practice, depending on whether or not there is a choice between different diagnostic and/or therapeutic hypotheses.\n\nIn the (most frequent) case where a treatment recognised and validated by medicine is proposed to the exclusion of all other options, the primary aim of the information provided is not to make a therapeutic choice (unless the patient opts to refuse treatment). The aim is to explain in an \"intelligible\" way the merits of the proposal put forward, in order to obtain the patient's assent and, where appropriate, any reservations he or she may have, to enable him or her to seek any help he or she may need and to organise his or her life accordingly. This is information of a medical and social nature, prior to acceptance (or refusal) of the proposed treatment, with the aim of health education to improve compliance with prescriptions and optimise the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nIn the case of diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives, on the other hand, information is part of a process of choice where, in theory, after being informed, the patient can opt for one proposal rather than another.\n\nHow far should we go in providing information? Should we talk about all the risks, including those of death linked to a treatment or those whose occurrence is exceptional?\n\nThe answers lie in the development of the legal rules governing the provision of information to a patient. Several criteria have been established to define the contractual framework between a doctor and his patient:\n\n* the capacity of persons to contract with each other (qualified doctor, registered with the Conseil de l'ordre on the one hand; patient, of legal age, legally capable on the other);\n* quality criteria concerning the commitment of the professional (obligation to use reasonable means, respect for professional secrecy, etc.) and of the patient (compliance with prescriptions and monitoring rules);\n* a lawful cause for the medical action: a clear and legitimate medical aim justifying the medical action that affects the patient's integrity;\n* consent must be obtained after the patient has been provided with quality information, without pressure, i.e. informed and free consent.\n\nIn this legal approach, information and consent become one of the criteria for the validity of a contract.\n\nWith regard to the characteristics of this information, on 21 December 1961 the Civil Division of the Court of Cassation emphasised that it should be \"simple, approximate, intelligible and fair\". Since 1995, article 35 of the Code of Medical Ethics has stipulated that:\n\n''\" The doctor owes the person he is examining, treating or advising fair, clear and appropriate information'' about his ''condition, the investigations and care he is proposing''. Throughout the course of the illness, he shall take account of the patient's personality in his explanations and ensure that they are understood\".\n\nWe note that the terms \"simple\" and \"approximate\" have disappeared, reflecting a desire to be more rigorous in the approach and rejecting excessive simplicity or approximation. As far as risks are concerned (bearing in mind that all medical procedures and prescriptions, even the most routine, involve them), the information must include them insofar as they are normally foreseeable.\n\nWith regard to the concepts of rarity and severity of the risk, in 2000 the Conseil d'\u00c9tat (an administrative court that rules on disputes involving public hospitals) stated that the mere fact that risks occur only exceptionally does not relieve the practitioner of his obligation, and that when a medical act entails a risk of death or invalidity the patient must be informed, even if this is exceptional.\n\nThese developments led to the law of 4 March 2002, which stipulates that all frequent or serious risks that are normally foreseeable must be brought to the patient's attention before a procedure is carried out, but also \"a posteriori\" (i.e. in the short, medium and long term), if new consequences and risks are identified.\n\n''\" Everyone has the right to be informed about their state of health. This information concerns the various investigations, treatments or preventive measures proposed, their usefulness, any urgency, their consequences, the frequent or serious risks normally foreseeable which they entail, as well as the other possible solutions and the foreseeable consequences in the event of refusal. When, after the investigations, treatments or preventive actions have been carried out, new risks are identified, the person concerned must be informed, unless it is impossible to trace him or her\". Law of 4 March 2002''\n\n== Rules and criteria for assessing the quality of the information provided ==\nAll healthcare professionals have a duty to provide information within the scope of their competence and in compliance with the professional rules applicable to them. The only exceptions to this duty are in cases of urgency or where it is impossible to provide information. This information is provided during an individual interview, as part of a dialogue. The purpose of the information is twofold:\n\n* respect patients' autonomy of choice by giving them all the information they need to make an informed decision, i.e. to consent to the proposed treatment;\n\n* to provide them with all the information they need to take part in their care and receive all the advice and assistance they need to organise their lives.\n\nThis information is provided first and foremost to the patient. If the patient so wishes (i.e. with his or her consent, so as not to breach medical confidentiality without his or her knowledge), it can be given in the presence of a close relative or a trusted person. However, to ensure that the patient remains free to talk about matters that he or she would not wish to discuss in the presence of a third party, it is important to suggest that the interview should initially be an individual one, and that the third party should only be invited secondarily. In the case of minors and patients who are unable to reach the age of majority, information is provided to their parents or legal representatives, but without excluding the patient from access to information. As soon as their age and situation allow, patients must themselves receive information adapted to their degree of maturity. In the case of minors, as far as possible, the information is given to the two holders of parental authority. If only one is present, the healthcare professional will explain the need to inform the other, whether or not the couple are separated. In situations where the prognosis or risk is serious, it is preferable to have an interview with both parents.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the provision of information must comply with certain rules of good practice: it must be based on complete, validated data that is up to date with advances in medicine and science (in practice, this means that the data must be up to date); it must be understandable to everyone (avoiding medical-technical formulations that are the domain of professional terms and skills); and finally, in terms of content, it must meet five essential points, which must be addressed and discussed with every patient and their representative: the aims of the medical approach, its advantages and disadvantages, its risks, as well as the risks of not implementing it, the constraints generated and the impact on daily life, possible help and support: social rights, help (professional and/or associative) to facilitate the person's progress through the care pathway and their daily life.\n\n== The place of the written word and the issue of traceability of information and consent ==\nIn practice, as far as the form is concerned, the information must remain above all oral''''''''. It may be aided by the provision of appropriate educational information documents to the patient. Apart from specific cases provided for by law (organ donation from a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.\n\nThe information document must meet the same quality criteria as those mentioned above. In addition, it is recommended that information documents should be drawn up by a collegiate body, within learned medical societies or healthcare groups and institutions, tested on patients and validated with user representatives. The advantage of consensual information of this kind is that it produces a benchmark drawn up by experts.\n\nThese documents should encourage patients to ask doctors any questions they may have. They can be enhanced with visual aids or linked to websites with animated diagrams or videos. They should be translated or explained in the patient's own language.\n\nAnother medico-legal issue concerns the traceability of the information provided, i.e. the elements that make it possible, in the event of a dispute, to prove that the patient has been properly informed. On 25 February 1997, a ruling by the French Supreme Court, known as the \"H\u00e9dreul ruling\" - named after the patient concerned - quashed and annulled the judgement of a Court of Appeal concerning a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp, following which the patient had suffered an intestinal perforation, the risk of which he claimed he had not been informed. Initially, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case, ruling that the patient had to prove that the doctor had not warned him. In its ruling, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed that doctors have a specific obligation to inform their patients; it also stated that it is now up to the doctor to prove that he has fulfilled this obligation (creating what has been called a reversal of the burden of proof, which no longer lies with the patient). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Court takes into account the reality of the consultation process, specifying that the methods of proof remain unrestricted and that, according to its ruling of 14 October 1997, information may be proven by any means, except in cases where a special legal provision imposes a particular method of proof (such as written consent, for example, in medical research, or for organ removal from living donors).\n\nSince this decision, we have seen the development of brochures or information sheets on examinations and treatments. However, it should be remembered that these documents, although recommended, and even if some have patients sign them, do not free doctors and healthcare structures from other approaches. The quality of the information provided covers other aspects, which will also be taken into account in the event of a dispute. The following will be taken into account: consultation times, information meetings organised by healthcare structures, brochures given to patients, letters exchanged between doctors (in particular with the general practitioner) with copies given to patients, elements of the medical file given to patients.\n\nIt is important that all these information sessions are recorded in the medical record (by whom, in whose presence, on what date), together with any difficulties encountered in providing them. It is also important to mention any situations in which it was impossible or complex to obtain information, and to justify this on the basis of the patient's clinical and social situation.\n\nIt is therefore important not to forget that a written document does not free the doctor from all the other means of information that he or she may deem necessary, and in particular that the oral time spent with the patient is of major importance.",

The PSA level depends on the volume of the prostate.\n*Certain drugs (5 alpha reductase inhibitors) can artificially lower PSA levels.\n\n*The threshold value that should give cause for alarm is 4 ng/ml, but this value should be weighted according to the volume of the prostate and the age of the patient. A 1st elevated test must be confirmed by a 2nd elevated test (within 3 months of the first). A regular increase in PSA over several tests (> 0.75 ng/ml.year) should prompt a search for prostate cancer.\n\n*Early individual diagnosis should only be offered to patients who have been previously informed and whose life expectancy is prolonged (> 10 years).\n*Early diagnosis is recommended from the age of 50 (40-45 if there are risk factors) and continues until the age of 70.

Prostate MRI is performed systematically prior to prostate biopsy. MRI can be used to detect supectral lesions in the gland and to better sample the prostate with additional biopsy samples from the most suspicious area (targeted biopsy). If the serum PSA or digital rectal examination is abnormal, a normal prostate MRI does not rule out the need for a biopsy.

This individual assessment should be carried out systematically before any initial prescription or prescription renewal, in order to assess the \"benefit/risk ratio\" of the prescription in question, and should be continued on an ongoing basis throughout the prescription period.\n\n==Pre-therapeutic assessment\nBefore any prescription is given, the patient must be assessed on the basis of :\n\n*Their \"demographic characteristics\": age (extreme ages sometimes require treatment to be adapted), weight (extreme weights can have an impact on drug pharmacokinetics), ethnic origin (certain genetic polymorphisms are more frequent depending on the patient's origin, leading to treatment restrictions or adaptations).\n*Medical history: any allergies and intercurrent pathologies (which may contraindicate certain drugs).\n*Assessment of the patient's \"major drug purification functions\": assessment of renal function (estimate of glomerular filtration rate) and liver function (presence of hepatocellular insufficiency and severity of any impairment).\n*Drug treatments'' already prescribed to the patient and/or self-medicated (which may need to be adapted depending on the risk of drug interaction).\n\n==Therapeutic objective ==\nThe prescriber must also establish a ''therapeutic objective'' in a ''concerted manner with the patient'', based on objective factors that enable the achievement of this objective to be assessed.

The selection criteria are based on :\n\n*L'''' authorisation de mise sur le march\u00e9'' (AMM) of the medicinal product in a ''precise indication''. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and carried out under strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.\n*The \"level of evidence\" of the drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should always be guided by the ''highest level of evidence'', and where the level of evidence is equal, preference should be given to the medicinal product with the greatest experience of use.\n*The patient's ''pre-therapeutic assessment'', the ''therapeutic objective'' defined and the individual benefit-risk ratio previously established for this patient.\n\n==Treatment evaluation\nOnce the prescription has been made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers :\n\n*The ''efficacy of the treatment'', which must be consistent with the therapeutic objective defined above.\n*Assessment of the drug's ''safety profile'', which will focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.\n*Drug monitoring, based on clinical data (e.g. blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g. blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment) and pharmacovigilance data, pharmacological therapeutic monitoring OIC-321-02-A|pharmacological therapeutic monitoring]]'' (measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation, for example).\n\nThese elements of treatment evaluation enable the \"benefit-risk ratio\" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period, and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.",

Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n* Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (sulphonylureas): Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc). They are associated with '''glinides''' (<u>repaglinide</u>) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: <u>hypoglycaemia</u> and weight gain [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics variable depending on the molecule and <u>therefore variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides</u>. <u>No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.</u>\n\n* '''Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (colloquially DPP4, family: \"gliptins\").''' Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). <u>Posology to be adjusted to renal function.</u> Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.\n\n* '''GLP1 receptor agonists (colloquially GLP1 agonists).''' Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. <Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia.</u> Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.\n\n* '''Intestinal alphaglucosidase inhibitor,''' only representative: <u>acarbose</u>. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.\n\n* '''SGLT2 inhibitors.''' Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. <u>Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects [[Adult heart failure]] [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]</u>. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation.

In the event of an emergency, the pharmacist must inform the prescriber as soon as possible.\n\n===Special case of generics===\nSince 1999, pharmacists have had the right - under certain conditions - to [[Know how to explain the prescription of a generic drug or biosimilar 2C-326-PC-A02|substitute a prescribed drug with a generic drug]] belonging to the same ''generic group''. The aim of substitution is to generate savings for the Assurance Maladie.\n\n==Role of nurses==\nAccording to article ''R4312-42 du CSP:''' ''l'infirmier '''applique''' et '''respecter''' la prescription m\u00e9dicale qui, sauf urgence, est '''\u00e9crite''', quantitative et qualitative, dat\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e. They ask the prescriber for \"additional information\" whenever they consider it useful, particularly if they feel they have not been adequately informed. If the nurse has any ''doubt'' about the prescription, he checks it with the prescriber or, if this is not possible, with another member of the profession concerned. In the event of i'''mpossibility of verification'' and of ''''manifest''' and ''''imminent''' risks to the patient's health, he shall, by virtue of his own competence, adopt the <nowiki/>'''attitude which best safeguards the patient's health''', and shall not cause the patient to take any unjustified risk.'' <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033496651</ref>\n\n===Special case of hospitals===\nThe role of nurses is different in the hospital circuit, insofar as nurses are systematically involved, normally after pharmaceutical validation, with the medical prescription for all types of medicines, whereas in outpatient medicine, nurses are only involved after the prescription for certain medicines, particularly injectables. Generally speaking, in hospitals, most nursing acts relating to medicines, such as the administration of medicines, fall into the category of delegated acts, requiring a medical prescription (R4311-7 CSP) and not the specific role (R4311-5 CSP) of nursing staff.\n\n==Responsibility of those involved downstream of the medical prescription===\nOn several occasions, the French courts have ruled that the \"execution of a prescription\" entails the \"liability\" of those involved downstream of the prescription and not that of the prescriber alone.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the courts have been able to ''simultaneously'' engage the liability of the ''prescriber'' and either a ''pharmacist'' or a ''nurse'', whether before the ''civil'' or ''administrative'' courts (compensation for harm suffered by the victim in outpatient or hospital medicine) or before the ''criminal courts'' (punishment for an offence committed in both the private and public sectors), in particular for errors in dosage, indication or the name of the medicine.\n\nIn addition, these professionals report to a '''professional order''' which can also '''sanction''' them (disciplinary responsibility) for failure to comply with the ethical rules laid down in their respective codes of ethics.<references />",

In this situation, it can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided that it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and must demonstrate that it has identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator. This is demonstrated in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may, however, contain excipients that are different from those of the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, colour and taste of a generic drug may also be different from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.\n\n==Authorisation of generic medicinal products ==\nGeneric medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. In practice, marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine on the basis of the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. The latter type of study must be randomised, cross-over and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin (medicines for which a small variation in concentration will modify the effect of the medicine), the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.\n\n==''Substitution of a generic drug'''==\nGeneric drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.\n\nAs prescriptions must be in INN, the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine are authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic.\n\nThe prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must take account of the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:\n\n*In particular, if the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.\n*If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed.\n\n==Refusal to substitute ==\nUnder very specific conditions, requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, he/she must write \"non-substitutable\" on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in 3 situations:\n\n*Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.\n*Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product in the event that this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.\n*Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.\n\nPharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled \"non-substitutable\" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.\n\n==''Biosimilar medicinal product'''==\nA biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, the complexity of the molecule and the difficulty involved in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.\n\n==Authorisation of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBiosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.\n\nIf a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g. marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n==Interchangeability of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBy definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment, but requires: informing the patient and obtaining his or her consent; recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file; and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",

Since 1<sup>er</sup> January 2018, social protection for the self-employed (RSI) has been entrusted to the general Social Security scheme.\n\n- '''le r\u00e9gime agricole''', within the Mutualit\u00e9 sociale agricole (MSA), covers '''5% of the French population''' and concerns farmers and agricultural employees[1]; made up of a ''one-stop shop'' that manages both health insurance, occupational accidents and diseases, retirement and family benefits. The MSA itself manages the collection of its contributions.\nFile:19 MSA.png\n</gallery>\n\n* The special schemes predate the general scheme and refused to join it in 1945. Although they predate the creation of the Social Security system, they were maintained by the legislator in the decree of 8 June 1946, which is set out in articles L711-1 and R711-1 of the Social Security Code. The latter states: \"The following remain subject to a special social security organisation, if their members already benefit from a special scheme under one or more of the social security legislations:\n* administrations, services, offices, public establishments of the State, industrial establishments of the State and the Imprimerie Nationale, for civil servants, magistrates and workers of the State;\n* regions, d\u00e9partements and communes;\n\n* departmental and communal public establishments that are not of an industrial or commercial nature;\n* activities which entail membership of the French Seamen's Insurance Scheme established by the Decree-Law of 17 June 1938 as amended;\n* mining companies and companies treated as such, as defined by decree no 46-2769 of 27 November 1946, with the exception of activities relating to the exploration or exploitation of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons;\n* Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran\u00e7ais;\n* secondary general interest and local interest railways and tramways;\n* the production, transport and distribution of electricity and gas;\n* the Banque de France;\n* the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre national de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris and the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise.\n\nThere are three main types of special schemes:\n\n* the civil service scheme (civil servants and military personnel) ;\n* the scheme for public companies and establishments;\n* other schemes, smaller in terms of the number of beneficiaries, which may be structured either on a professional basis (schemes for notary clerks and employees, mines, churches, etc.) or on a company basis (schemes for staff of the Paris Opera, RATP, SNCF).\n\nThe organisation and operation of special schemes are quite different from one another. However, they are characterised by the fact that the various risks (sickness, family, retirement, accidents at work, etc.) are covered in different ways by the companies or institutions themselves, by specific funds or by the bodies of the General Scheme.\n\nSince 1945, however, we have witnessed a dual phenomenon:\n\n* a significant reduction in their number: while there were more than a hundred of them when Social Security was created in 1945, there will be 27 in 2021, concentrated mainly in the management of pensions (which explains the current problems of reforming the pension system);\n* a rapprochement with the R\u00e9gime G\u00e9n\u00e9ral, both in the way they operate and in the payment of benefits, which are increasingly aligned with it (particularly in terms of retirement and health insurance).\n\nSocial and economic changes have led to major transformations in the economic sectors covered by the special schemes: industrial sectors such as mining and tobacco have declined sharply, with fewer workers and therefore fewer resources for these schemes. The deterioration in the ratio between the number of contributors and the number of beneficiaries poses, in the more or less short term, the problem of the sustainability of these schemes.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.securite-sociale.fr/la-secu-cest-quoi/organisation/les-regimes#:~:text=Les%20R%C3%A9gimes%20sp%C3%A9ciaux,7%25%20de%20la%20population%20fran%C3%A7aise</nowiki>.",

Severe LBW corresponds to a LBW below the 3rd percentile.\n\n- IUGR most often corresponds to PAG associated with arguments in favour of a pathological growth defect: longitudinal growth arrest or inflection (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).\n\n'''Risk factors:''''\n\n1 Foetal pathologies\n\nIn 10-20% of cases, IUGR has a foetal cause: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). IUGR tends to be early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and is often associated with morphological abnormalities.\n\n''2.    Vascular pathologies''\n\nThey account for 35-50% of IUGR. IUGR most often occurs late (in the 3rd trimester), but can occur early in severe forms. IUGR can recur in subsequent pregnancies.\n\nIn the case of IUGR, the arguments in favour of a vascular cause are :\n\n- association with hypertension or even pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]]''' and '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''). This association is frequent and very suggestive, but inconstant;\n\n- association with a chronic maternal pathology: chronic ''[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]]''', nephropathy (''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|Increased creatinine]]'''), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications (''[[Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320|Prevention of cardiovascular disease]]''');\n\n- a history of vascular IUGR in a previous pregnancy.\n\n- association with oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid);\n\n- abnormal uterine or umbilical Doppler, reflecting disturbances in maternal-foetal exchanges. These Doppler anomalies result in a quantifiable increase in circulatory resistance in the uterine and/or umbilical arteries (resistance index, pulsatility index) and spectral disturbances.\n\n''3.    Other causes and risk factors''\n\nThese are the following factors:\n\n- maternal age < 20 or > 35 ;\n\n- '''[[Malnutrition/malnutrition SD-030|Malnutrition/Denutrition]]'''', low weight gain during pregnancy ;\n\n- low socio-economic level ('''[[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|precarious social situation and isolation]]''') ;\n\n- smoking (''''[[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314|prevention of tobacco-related risks]]'''), alcoholism, drug addiction ;\n\n- uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids ('''[[Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-229|Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination]]''');\n\n- Placental abnormalities, such as a chorioangioma\n\n- velamentous insertion of the cord which must be systematically sought.\n\nFinally, a third of IUGRs remain poorly explained.\n\n<br />",

In addition, total social protection expenditure other than benefits (\u20ac59 billion) has risen very sharply (+24.6% compared with -2.0% in 2019). This non-benefits item includes in particular additional expenditure linked to the health crisis, amounting to \u20ac11 billion, such as the purchase of masks and equipment linked to the health crisis or financial aid granted to healthcare professionals due to their reduced activity during the confinements.\n\n\nThe two main social risks accounting for the largest financial burden remain old age (43%) and health (33%) of social protection expenditure (Chart 1). The growth in social protection expenditure is linked in particular to employment support measures as a result of the introduction of short-time working.\n\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:19-G1 social benefits.png\n</gallery>\n\n\nOld-age and survivors' benefits have slowed down since the introduction of four major reforms to the pension system in 1993, 2003, 2008 and 2010: 1) indexation of pensions to inflation rather than wages, 2) calculation of pensions based on the best 25 years instead of the best 10 in the private sector, 3) increase in the number of years needed to qualify for the full rate, 4) increase in the legal age for entitlement from 60 to 62.\n\n\n'''However, the average amount of pensions is inevitably increasing'' in social protection for several reasons:\n\n1) the rise in real wages over the generations, 2) the retirement of baby-boomers, who outnumber current generations, and 3) longer life expectancy.\n\n\nAs far as health risk is concerned, the rate of increase in expenditure has been slowed since the 1980s by a number of reform plans: 1) 1982-1983 (reduction in the reimbursement of certain drugs, etc.), 2) 1986 and 1993, which increased the proportion of expenditure to be borne by households, 3) 1996, with the introduction of the national target for health insurance expenditure (Ondam), which aims to control expenditure by basic schemes. This target was regularly exceeded until 2009, but the 2004 Health Act and the ongoing strengthening of its control and monitoring mechanisms have ensured that it has been respected since 2010.\n\nHowever, health insurance benefits in France will increase by 4.3% (after +2.4% in 2019) to \u20ac228 billion.\n\nThis increase can be explained by :\n\n- by increases in the provision of care in the hospital sector and, to a lesser extent, in outpatient care. Despite an overall fall in the volume of care outside covid-19-related care, public hospital expenditure has increased due to higher remuneration (Covid-19 bonuses, S\u00e9gur de la sant\u00e9 measures) and the additional costs of caring for patients with Covid-19. Outpatient treatment is also increasing, despite the drop in consultations with GPs and specialists due to the epidemic, but there has been a spectacular rise in laboratory procedures (Covid-19 screening tests). Lastly, daily benefits (IJ) increased by 24.4% in 2020 for two reasons. Firstly, the so-called \"derogatory\" IJs were used to compensate people who had to stop working during the initial confinement (parents without childcare, vulnerable people, self-employed workers). On the other hand, sick pay also increased, due to sick leave linked to the epidemic waves. Medical and social benefits (health and disability) will also increase in 2020. As in the hospital sector, this increase is primarily the result of pay rises for employees working in the facilities, as well as additional funding paid out to deal with the health crisis. Disability benefits will increase by 3.6% (after 3.3% in 2019), due to the automatic extension of entitlement to disability compensation benefits. On the other hand, benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases will fall in 2020 as a result of the fall in the number of accidents at work, which in turn is due to the reduction in professional activities and the massive use of teleworking during the pandemic.",

These contributions are for health, maternity, disability and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the \"contribution solidarit\u00e9 autonomie\" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.\n\nSocial security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favour of fiscal resources, on the one hand the CSG (general social contribution), and on the other hand exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include: transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme); taxes on products (taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance, etc.); taxes on wages and labour; taxes on income and wealth: this is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG, plus the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). State public contributions'' finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidise schemes.\n\nGraph 1: Origin of social protection resources (pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners).<gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig 1.png\n</gallery>Source: DREES.

It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   \n\nThe Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It \"aims to control social and health spending\". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.\n\nIt should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.\n\nThe LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.\n\nSince 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.\n\nExamples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.gouvernement.fr/presentation-du-projet-de-loi-de-financement-de-la-securite-sociale-2022</nowiki>",

Its aim is to regulate healthcare consumption by making patients financially responsible. The co-payment may be covered in full or in part by private insurance or a complementary mutual insurance company. It has existed since the creation of the French social security system, and applies to all reimbursable healthcare costs: consultations with a doctor, medical biology tests, radiology examinations, the purchase of prescribed drugs, etc.\n\nThe percentage of the co-payment varies according to :\n\n- the nature of the risk (illness, maternity, disability, industrial accident/occupational disease) ;\n\n- the procedure or treatment ;\n\n- whether or not you are following the coordinated care pathway.\n\nFor example, if you consult your GP (a general practitioner in sector 1), the consultation rate used as a basis for reimbursement is \u20ac25.\n\n* Of this amount, the Assurance Maladie will reimburse 70%, i.e. \u20ac17.50.\n* The co-payment is 30%, i.e. \u20ac7.50.\n* However, you will have to pay a fixed contribution of \u20ac1.\n* Your total out-of-pocket expenses are therefore \u20ac7.50 + \u20ac1, i.e. \u20ac8.50.\n\n\nA ''fixed contribution'' of \u20ac1 is charged for each consultation (see example above), biological analysis or radiology procedure, up to a maximum of \u20ac50 per year. Patients under the age of 18, beneficiaries of complementary health insurance, beneficiaries of the AME and pregnant women from the sixth month of pregnancy are exempt from the fixed contribution. It cannot be covered by a complementary health insurance organisation.\n\nAn ''excess'' is deducted from patient reimbursements and applies to: medicines (\u20ac0.50 per box); paramedical procedures (\u20ac0.50 per procedure); medical transport (\u20ac2 per transport).\n\nThe excess is capped at 50 euros per year in total and cannot exceed 2 euros per day for paramedical procedures and 4 euros per day for medical transport. Patients under the age of 18, beneficiaries of complementary health insurance, beneficiaries of the AME and pregnant women from the sixth month of pregnancy are exempt from the medical excess. It cannot be covered by a complementary health insurance organisation.\n\nThe ''tiers payant'' system exempts the insured person from having to pay in advance the costs covered by the health insurance scheme. The policyholder pays only the moderating fee, with the health insurance scheme paying the sums due directly to the care structures and health professionals. If the insured person has supplementary cover (mutual insurance, insurance, provident institution, supplementary health insurance), they can benefit from third-party payment by presenting their carte vitale and their supplementary cover certificate. Third-party payment also applies in the event of an accident at work or occupational illness, and to beneficiaries of complementary health cover and the AME.",

Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries. The \"social assistance logic\" allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (for example, in the context of what are known as minimum social benefits, such as the revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicap\u00e9 [AAH] or the fonds de solidarit\u00e9 vieillesse [FSV]). '''The logic of universal protection''' covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits).

France has chosen to achieve universal conversion of the population, whether or not they contribute to the financing of social security.\n\nThe general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), i.e. those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nSince 2018 and the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed (tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers and the non-regulated liberal professions).\n\n\n'''Organization'''\n\nSince the \"Jeanneney\" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organisation of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.\n\nThree of these branches cover one or more risks:\n\nhe Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It is responsible for supporting families in their day-to-day lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability;\n\nThe Sickness, Occupational Injuries and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers two types of risk: sickness, maternity, disability and death, and accidents at work and occupational diseases;\n\n'''the Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.'''\n\nIn addition, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a ''fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability''. This new branch will be managed by the Caisse nationale de solidarit\u00e9 pour l'autonomie (CNSA).\n\nTwo other branches carry out common, cross-functional tasks:\n\nthe social security contribution collection branch is managed by the Urssaf Caisse nationale (the new name, since 2021, of the Agence centrale des organismes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale - Acoss). It collects the resources allocated to the other branches of social security (i.e. it collects the social security contributions - employer's and employee's - paid by employers), through the intermediary of local offices - the Urssaf;\n\nthe F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des employeurs du R\u00e9gime g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale is managed by the Union des caisses nationales de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale (UCANSS). It is responsible for social dialogue, shared human resources management tasks and missions of common interest, such as property operations or sustainable development policies.\n\n\n\n'''Summary diagram'''\n\nThe general scheme will have four autonomous branches in 2021 (chart 1). The autonomy branch will be the fifth branch and is currently being set up.\n\nFigure 1: Organisation of the general social security system.\n\n<br /><gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n\nSource: health insurance. <nowiki>https://assurance-maladie.ameli.fr/qui-sommes-nous/organisation/securite-sociale/securite-sociale</nowiki>\n\nEach branch is headed by a national fund (a public administrative body), which coordinates and manages a network of regional funds.

In France, half of premature births are due to spontaneous prematurity (spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membranes) and the other half to induced prematurity.\n\nSpontaneous prematurity occurs after spontaneous labour with intact membranes ('''[[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman]], [[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]''') or after premature rupture of the membranes ('''[[Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109|Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman]'''). Induced prematurity is linked to a foetal or maternal pathology leading voluntarily to birth through medical intervention.\n\nThe main causes of induced prematurity are pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]] and [[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''), IUGR, [[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|'''Hypertension during pregnancy'''',Retroplacental haematoma]] and maternal pathologies requiring the birth of the child (respiratory insufficiency [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|''Acute respiratory distress''',]] decompensated heart disease, etc.).).\n\nPatients with preterm rupture of membranes may also have an induced delivery if the condition of the newborn or the mother requires induction of labour or a caesarean section.
