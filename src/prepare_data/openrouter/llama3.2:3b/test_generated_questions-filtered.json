The general principles of withdrawal are the same as outside pregnancy.\n\nAppropriate nicotine replacement therapy is often necessary to help pregnant women give up smoking. In order to adapt the dosage, dependence on nicotine should be assessed prior to pregnancy, using the Fagerström questionnaire, and sometimes the level of intoxication should be measured by means of exhaled CO (CO analyser).\n\nMedical interventions to help people stop smoking are essentially individualised aids. There are several types:\n\n- Advice and information tailored to the smoker's motivation and history, delivered to the patient using a variety of media: factsheets, electronic resources or telephone calls;\n\n- Information given to the woman on her level of smoking by objective measurement (CO analyser);\n\n- Psychological and/or behavioural approaches:\n\n- Minimal advice on quitting: this consists of asking about smoking status, whether or not there is a plan to quit and providing a simple written document on the subject,\n\n- Brief intervention: this involves probing the interview with open-ended questions.\n\n- Motivational interviewing: this consists of seeking out and highlighting the patient's personal motivations for considering or building up withdrawal,\n\n- Cognitive-behavioural therapy: this involves developing practical ways of getting round and overcoming cravings,\n\n- Psychological consultation,\n\n- Addictology consultation in the case of associated drug use ;\n\n- Nicotine prescription given to the patient in the event of pharmacological dependence ;\n\n- Other interventions that have been evaluated include hypnosis.\n\n'''293.

Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.\n\nWhen the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.\n\nThe classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:\n\n- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)\n\n- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)\n\n- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)\n\n- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in \"looking for associated lesions\": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",

Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation (cf [[Constipation in children and adults|item 283]]). Treating chronic constipation is therefore a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences and perhaps even complications.  Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fibre (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.\n\n==b) Medication:==\n'''Treatment of internal haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nDiosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms''. Local topicals include all ''emollient products'' for topical application (creams, ointments and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.\n\n'''Treatment of external haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nThe only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision (see below). However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are an alternative to incision/excision (see below). Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.\n\n==c) Principles of instrumental and surgical treatments\nThe term ''instrumental haemorrhoid treatment'' refers to all the procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, ''reinforce the supporting tissue and form a scar'' at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation) or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio, but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.\n\n\nSurgical haemorrhoid treatment'' is the term used to describe all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural or locoregional anaesthetic. There are \"two types of haemorrhoidal surgery\": \"those which remove\" the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and \"those which fix or tighten\" the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.\n\nThe treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, ''an incision or excision'' can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in ''relieving pain and shortening its course''. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see above).",

[[Frequency measurement, Prevalence, Incidence (rate of), Risk 2C-020-DE-A07]]), possibly comparing it with the incidence rate in the general population, or in other populations, or between several periods, possibly standardising on the distribution of sex, age (cf. [[Adjusted frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13|Standardised frequency measurement 2C-020-DE-B13]])\n* <u>Analytical</u>: to study the relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied by comparing frequency indicators of the health phenomenon between groups of exposed and unexposed subjects by tests and measures of association (cf. [Raw or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), number needed to treat (NNT) and crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]] and [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]. ).\n\nMethods of '''recruitment''' of the subjects making up the sample at the initial time :\n\n* <u>Cohort study with a cross-sectional starting point</u>: initial sample formed from the selection (preferably exhaustive) or random drawing of subjects presenting consecutively at one or more recruitment centres (source population, cf. [[Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05]]). This sampling aims to have the best possible representativeness of the target population.\n<u>Exposed/unexposed cohort studies</u>: a particular form of cohort in which exposed and unexposed subjects are selected separately.\n\n'''Follow-up''' after inclusion: what characterises a cohort is this follow-up of subjects (= <u>longitudinal study</u>) since their inclusion for a period generally determined for the study in order to collect data after inclusion:\n\n* the possible occurrence of the event studied (absent at inclusion) when the endpoint is qualitative with its date of occurrence, or changes in the level of the endpoint if it is quantitative (for which the baseline level is available at inclusion)\n* the date of early exit from the study due to death (if not part of the endpoint itself), relocation or lack of news (lost to follow-up).\n\nRetrospective, prospective or mixed character:\n\n* <u>Prospective cohort</u>: the start of inclusions is after the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n* <u>Retrospective cohort (= historical)</u>: the start of inclusions is prior to the date of finalisation of the study protocol.\n** The initial sample is reconstituted ''a posteriori'' as it might have been constituted in the past by selecting a group of subjects at an initial time in the past. This is only possible when we have a file of identifiable subjects for such a study (for example, a file of company employees with occupational health data) whose status with regard to the health phenomenon studied at inclusion can be determined, even for subjects who can no longer be contacted at the time the study is designed.\n** The follow-up history of these subjects between inclusion and the point date is therefore reconstructed retrospectively. This is therefore only possible if individual follow-up of subjects from inclusion to the point date is available.\n* <u>Mixed cohort</u>: combination of the two previous modes of inclusion (inclusion and follow-up partly retrospective then continuing after protocol finalisation prospective manner).\n\n== Case-control study\nInvolves the separate selection of two groups of subjects:\n\n* a group of subjects suffering from the event under study (''cases'')\n* a group of subjects not affected by the event under study (''controls'')\n\n'''Advantage''': being able to over-represent in the sample people carrying a phenomenon to be studied <u>rare</u> in the population (often a disease). In this case, it can be interesting to include several controls per case because the statistical power increases, but in general this gain is minimal compared with the logistical complexity beyond 5 controls per case.\n\nMeets exclusively '''analytical objectives''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied by comparing the prevalence of exposure in cases and controls by calculating the <u>odds-ratio</u>, which is the only measure of association that can generally be estimated in this type of survey (cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]).\n\nRecruitment of cases:\n\n* <u>Case-incident</u> (= the subject is included at the time he or she becomes a case): recruitment of cases on the occasion of diagnosis or the occurrence of the event.\n* <u>Prevalent-case</u> (= when included the subject has already been a case for some time): recruitment of cases regardless of how long ago the diagnosis was made (recruitment more often the source of selection bias - selective survival bias, cf. [[Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias 2C-020-DE-A12]] - but generally allows faster recruitment than case-incident recruitment because it is possible to \"draw on\" the active files of patients who have already been diagnosed).\n\nProcedures for '''recruiting controls''' must be thought through very carefully because, ideally, controls should come from the same population as cases: i.e. <u>any controls eligible and identifiable for the study could have been recruited as cases if they had developed the health phenomenon under study.</u> It is often done in parallel with the recruitment of cases, with possibly <u>matching</u> or <u>stratification.</u>\n\n'''Collection of exposures''' always <u>retrospective</u> in a case-control study for these two groups of subjects: the period covered by the collection of information on exposure is therefore always prior to the start of the survey.\n\n== Cross-sectional survey ==\nMainly used to'''' estimate the level of qualitative indicators (prevalences, distributions) or quantitative indicators (averages, medians, variances, etc.)''' in a targeted population.\n\nCan meet a number of objectives:\n\n* '''Mainly descriptive''': estimating the level of indicators in a target population with a quantifiable margin of error (confidence interval) due to sampling fluctuations. In particular, this is the only study that makes it possible to estimate <u>prevalences</u> of a binary health phenomenon at the time of the study in a target population (provided that the sample recruited is representative of the population targeted in theory by the objectives)\n* '''Sometimes analytical''': to study the relationship between the exposure factor and the studied phenomenon collected at the time of the study, by estimating measures of association (relative risk, odds ratio, cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]). But the interpretation of these associations is all the more limited because the <u>chronological relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied</u> is not always easy to establish, and because previously exposed subjects who have developed a rapidly fatal form of the disease will not be included in the study (selective survival bias, see [[More advanced knowledge on biases 2C-020-DE-B14]]).\n\nRecruitment procedures: guided by the need to be as representative as possible of the population targeted by the study. Selection must be independent, i.e. it must not take into account the subjects' health status or the level of exposure, which we may be seeking to study if they constitute risk factors for the phenomenon under study. Random selection or consecutive inclusion of subjects within a source population are the methods of choice for these studies.\n\n'''Information collected''': status of each subject included with regard to the phenomenon studied and possibly exposure factors at the time of inclusion, regardless of the age of the events collected. It is not uncommon to collect in addition the <u>background and history</u> on the phenomenon studied and the exposure factors of the subjects relating to the period prior to inclusion, possibly since their birth. In contrast, <u>no data on events occurring after the subject's inclusion in the study are collected in a cross-sectional survey</u>.",

It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).\n\nThere are two pathophysiological phases:\n\n#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to naïve LTCD8+. The naïve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.\n#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification.jpg|vignette|Figure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification]]\n\n\nFigure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity according to the Gel and Coombs classification.\n\nModel of allergic contact eczema.\n\nAsymptomatic sensitisation phase (production of allergen-specific T lymphocytes on first contact)\n\nReveal phase on new contact (clinical eczema)",

It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   \n\nThe Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It \"aims to control social and health spending\". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.\n\nIt should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.\n\nThe LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.\n\nSince 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.\n\nExamples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.gouvernement.fr/presentation-du-projet-de-loi-de-financement-de-la-securite-sociale-2022</nowiki>",

Its incidence in France is around 1 to 2/1000 in its complete form, and it is often under-diagnosed. This syndrome combines four elements, to varying degrees:\n\n- Moderate intrauterine growth retardation\n\n- Typical facial dysmorphia including :\n\no Abnormalities of the upper lip (thinness) and philtrum (bulging)\n\no Pronounced nasal bridge, short nose\n\no Narrow palpebral fissures, epicanthus and hypertelorism\n\no Bilateral Ptosis\n\no Hypertrichosis with synophrisis\n\no Cleared chin with retrognathism\n\no Low and badly hemmed ears\n\n- Malformations: present in 10 to 30% of severe forms: mainly neurological (spina bifida, agenesis of corpus callosum, cerebellar anomalies, hydrocephalus, etc.), cardiac (mainly CIA and CIV), skeletal (scoliosis, radio-ulnar synostosis, clinodactyly, etc.) and facial (cleft lip and palate).\n\n- delayed acquisition, combining cognitive and behavioural problems of varying intensity. In the most severe forms, the delay in acquisition may be referred to as mental retardation and prevent the child from having a conventional education or even being independent (living in an institution). These disorders may appear even though there is no growth retardation or dysmorphia, particularly in cases where alcohol consumption is more moderate. In these cases, we prefer to use the term FASD (Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder) rather than FAS, which can occur at a rate of up to 5/1000 births. There may also be an isolated drop in intelligence quotient (IQ), behavioural problems such as aggression, hyperactivity, fine motor skills or tone disorders, and delayed acquisition of language and writing;\n\n'''115.

While the profession, represented in this case by the Ordre National des Médecins, is responsible for drafting it, the resulting text is submitted to the administration, the Conseil d'Etat and finally the government, each of which is responsible for checking that it complies with the laws and other regulations governing the society in which doctors practise, and may make amendments. Finally, the code is published in the Journal Officiel under the signature of the Prime Minister.\n\nThe Code of Ethics sets out the regulatory provisions governing professional practice. They are subordinate to other more important texts, in particular the Constitution and laws; they must be compatible with other decrees and require other texts of lesser scope, in particular decrees. Like other citizens, doctors are subject to the law - regarding respect for life or professional secrecy, for example - but the smooth running of their professional body is promoted by rules of their own.\n\n* See the text of the code of ethics for doctors <nowiki>https://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/code-deontologie</nowiki>",

As it has grown, it has been extended to cover groups of people, such as students, the unemployed and government contract workers, who are not employed in the private sector. France has chosen to achieve universal conversion of the population, whether or not they contribute to the financing of social security.\n\nThe general scheme is currently the largest in terms of the number of people covered (nearly 30 million), i.e. those covered for sickness, family, retirement, industrial accidents and occupational diseases.\n\nSince 2018 and the abolition of the Social Scheme for the Self-Employed (RSI), the general scheme has managed the social risks of the self-employed (tradespeople, industrialists, shopkeepers and the non-regulated liberal professions).\n\n\n'''Organization'''\n\nSince the \"Jeanneney\" decree of 21 August 1967 on the administrative and financial organisation of social security, the General Scheme has been divided into branches of activity headed by an autonomous national fund.\n\nThree of these branches cover one or more risks:\n\nhe Family branch is managed by the Caisse nationale des allocations familiales (Cnaf). It is responsible for supporting families in their day-to-day lives, childcare, access to housing, and the fight against poverty and disability;\n\nThe Sickness, Occupational Injuries and Occupational Risks branch is managed by the Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CNAM). It covers two types of risk: sickness, maternity, disability and death, and accidents at work and occupational diseases;\n\n'''the Old Age branch is managed by the Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse (CNAV). It pays basic retirement pensions.'''\n\nIn addition, the laws of 7 August 2020 introduce a ''fifth branch of social security to cover the risk of loss of autonomy and disability''.

The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to think of it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process the patient is given information so that, on the one hand, she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure and, on the other, once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for a variety of reasons ranging from the material difficulties encountered by families (identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult carrying trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",

If this is not the case (proven lymph node invasion or breast lesion of more than 5 cm), an axillary curage (removal of all the axillary lymph nodes) will be carried out intraoperatively. The sentinel lymph node technique significantly reduces the risk of complications associated with lymph node dissection (lymphoedema).\n*An extension assessment is carried out when there are negative prognostic factors.

The opposite attitude means that errors are hidden. Failure to analyse them in depth creates second victims. A second victim can be defined as: \"a carer who is involved in and traumatised by an unforeseen and unfavourable event for a patient and/or a medical error for which he or she often feels personally responsible, leading to a feeling of failure and calling into question his or her clinical experience and fundamental skills\".

Reporting is based on facts that are not interpreted;\n\n- anonymity and confidentiality will be respected in the analysis that follows the reporting of the error or adverse event;\n\n- To be effective, reporting must be exhaustive, identifying all the risks associated with hospital activity and preventing them from recurring.\n\nSerious adverse events occurring in hospitals are usually identified using passive systems based on :\n\n- voluntary reporting by doctors and other healthcare professionals, even though the 2009 \"Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory\" law makes it compulsory;\n\n- the desire of patients, their families or close friends to explain the problems they have encountered or to obtain compensation for the harm they feel they have suffered.\n\nThis information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.\n\nThe third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces.

The Allen manoeuvre involves compressing the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist and then asking the patient to flex and extend the fingers until the hand becomes discoloured.\n\nWhen the ulnar artery is released, the hand recolours, which means that the superficial palmar arch is permeable, as are the digital arteries.\n\nThe same manoeuvre is performed by releasing the radial artery; if the hand recolours, this means that the deep palmar arch is permeable as well as the digital arteries.

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196°C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",

In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.\n\nIn verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterised by :\n\n- no encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words)\n\n- a collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge)\n\n- above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word \"truck\": \"what was the vehicle?\"), with clues often causing \"intrusions\" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.\n\nConsolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the \"five-word test\", a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item \"free recall/indexed recall\".\n\nThis profile of memory impairment :\n\n- as opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).\n\n- results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome)\n\n- is a good clinical argument in favour of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease)\n\n- is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD)\n\n- is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.",

It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.\n\nThe aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:1.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray. A-B. Solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura. C-D. Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes. E-F. Aneurysm of the aortic arch. G-H. Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos.\n</gallery><br />Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths=\"800\" heights=\"600\">\nFile:2.jpg|'''Figure 2''. A-B.

This is a surgical emergency.\n\n*Complications associated with ovarian puncture:\n**The risks associated with ''anaesthesia'' are common to all types of anaesthesia, local, sedation or general depending on the situation.\n**Risks associated with \"ovarian puncture\" are extremely rare (haemoperitoneum, pelvic infections including tubo-ovarian abscesses), intestinal or urinary tract lesions.\n\n*Complications related to the evolution of the pregnancy obtained:\n**The complications of the onset of pregnancy by MAP are the same as for a spontaneous pregnancy (risk of spontaneous miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy), the monitoring of the pregnancy is identical to that of a natural pregnancy.\n**The ''risk of gravid venous thromboembolism'' is slightly greater when a pregnancy occurs immediately after IVF-c or ICSI, compared with spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies after IUI.  \n**Multiple pregnancies\" are slightly more frequent, depending on the number of embryos transferred (1 or 2) and the multi-follicular response to stimulation in the case of IUI. The risk of prematurity, caesarean section, low birth weight and perinatal death is increased compared with a single pregnancy.\n\n*Long-term complications of MAP:\n**Risks inherent in the '''transmission of a possible genetic abnormality'' male or female responsible for infertility.\n**Potential excess risk of certain ''congenital malformations'' (musculoskeletal, cardiac, urogenital, etc.) and even cancer in the child in the case of IVF-c or ICSI techniques. However, these complications remain very rare in terms of frequency. In the current state of knowledge, the question of whether this risk is linked to the procedures used in MAP or whether it is linked to the intrinsic biological factors associated with the couple's infertility remains unresolved.\n**The data concerning the carcinological risks of patients undergoing MAP are very reassuring.\n\n<br />",

The position of individuals on the social ladder influences the conditions in which they grow up, learn, live, work and age, and their vulnerability to disease and its consequences\". (WHO, Commission on Social Determinants of Health).\n\nFor example, difficulties in accessing housing or employment, a polluted and noisy living environment, the experience of exclusion or inequality... All these factors can add up to a multiplier effect.\n\nDiscrimination increases stress\n\nExperiencing discrimination contributes to the stress experienced by people who are subjected to it, which can result in poorer cardiovascular health. People exposed to ethno-racial discrimination are in poorer health according to a meta-analysis (Paradies 2015). This discrimination is a risk factor for depressive, anxiety and psychotic symptoms, as well as for suicidal behaviour (Bardol et al. 2020). They can accumulate in people's experience and 'wear them down' (Wilkinson 2015). The accumulation of disadvantages has a corrosive dimension (Pelet, Charles and Dergham 2020).\n\nDiscrimination can also make it difficult for professionals to practise, particularly because of the tension between ethical requirements and the reality on the ground.\n\n'''Discrimination is a major contributor to non-take-up.''''\n\nNon-take-up occurs when people affected by public policies do not use the benefits or services to which they are entitled. Non-take-up is a widespread phenomenon, particularly in healthcare: in addition to factors linked to geographical distance, territorial disparities and unequal health literacy, discrimination can be a direct contributory factor. Anticipating rejection, stigmatising remarks, having to pay in advance or having to pay more, people from vulnerable populations and/or in economically precarious situations may decide not to visit a professional, delaying their treatment or worsening their state of health. In addition to encountering difficulties in accessing healthcare or facing barriers that prevent them from accessing care, some people no longer find their place in the social protection and healthcare system and no longer accept the nature of the interactions it offers (https://odenore.msh-alpes.fr/).",

They therefore reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ''survival time''. They are also called \"censored variables\" because of their incomplete nature:\n\n* If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).\n* When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ''censoring'': the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ''lost to view'' before the end of the study (e.g. following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.\n\nMethodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to take account of this censoring of survival time.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not knowing the event before t) and can therefore be represented graphically in the form of a ''survival curve'' as in the figure below.\n[[File:FigureSurvival.jpg|thumbnail|Example of survival curve]]\nA survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase). The vertical lines represent censures, i.e. the last visit of individuals lost to follow-up. The ''median survival'', which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample. In this example, it is 6 months.\n\nThe log-rank test is used to compare (univariate) the survival curves of two (or more) samples.\nThe hazard ratio is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of the event occurring over time. It is interpreted as a relative risk. The value observed in a sample is always accompanied by its confidence interval. It can be estimated in a multivariate (adjusted) analysis, most often using a regression model known as the Cox model.",

This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitised without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.\n\n'''Allergy'''\n\nHypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes).

The memory T cells recognise the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.\n\n\nFor example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema (cf Lisa item 187) and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g. pulmonary granulomatosis).",

Atelectasis can also be passive (pulmonary collapse on contact with a pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome, for example) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).\n\nAtelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by ''a direct sign and indirect signs''.\n\n#Direct sign'': opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity has the following characteristics\n#*Systematised with sharp edges.

A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis.

Assessment is generally limited to the pain area, pain intensity (rest, effort), consumption of analgesics, and sometimes associated anxiety.\n\n- In the case of chronic pain (a \"multi-dimensional\" entity with sensory, emotional, cognitive and behavioural components), the objectives are symptomatic and aetiological treatment is rarely possible (HAS 1999 recommendations):\n\n- Assessment takes time and can be spread over several consultations''.\n\n- '''It involves an etiological assessment with an interview, a clinical examination and, if necessary, additional tests'''\n\n\n'''<u>Know the tools and scales for assessing pain in communicating and non-communicating adults</u>''''\n\n'''General principles '''\n\n- Always use the same scale for the same patient unless there are changes in cognitive ability.\n\n- If the patient has several painful sites, each pain must be assessed separately.\n\n\n'''Self-assessment scales for pain and its impact'''\n\n- Aimed at ''communicating'' patients, i.e. children over the age of 6 or adults able to communicate verbally (no major cognitive disorders or disorders of consciousness).\n\n- They mainly comprise \"pain intensity scales\" (Table 2) and \"multidimensional scales\".\n\n- Intensity scales can be used to assess the intensity of pain at the present time or over the last 24 hours, and if necessary to identify the 'emergency' to be treated, the level of painkillers to be used, the evolution of the pain and the patient's level of relief.\n\n- Multidimensional scales take into account different aspects of chronic pain and its repercussions. The most widely used is the McGill Pain Questionnaire, which explores the sensory and affective dimensions of pain. These scales should only be used in the management of chronic pain.\n\n- The assessment of chronic pain can be supplemented by scales for depression, anxiety, quality of life and sleep, which are not specific to pain. The most widely used scale is the Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), which assesses the anxiety and/or depression component in chronic pain patients.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Table 2: Pain intensity scales\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)''''\n\nIt generally takes the form of a 100 mm ruler, horizontal (adult) or vertical (child), with one end corresponding to \"no pain\" and the other to \"maximum imaginable pain\". On the side presented to the patient is a cursor that the patient can move to the point where he or she feels the most pain. On the other side are scales seen by the carer, enabling him to determine the precise intensity of the pain (in cm or mm).  \n\n\n<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:EVA adults.png|EVA adult\nFile:EVA child.png|Vertical EVA (child) (<nowiki>https://sparadrap.org</nowiki>)\n</gallery>\n                                                                             \n\n\n                                                                             \n\n'''The Numerical Scale (EN)'''\n\nProvides a numerical scoring system with or without visual support. Patients are asked to quantify the intensity of their pain from 0 to 10 at a given moment.

Each type of population (young children, post-operative young children, non-communicative elderly people, confused or sedated adult patients) has its own behavioural scales, validated in each typical population.\n\n- The areas of behavioural observation most frequently included in these scales are :\n\n- facial expression (mimicry, grimace) and crying ;\n\n- vocalization or verbalization of pain ;\n\n- Each hetero-evaluation scale has a threshold score which has been defined as being associated with pain of significant intensity.

The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumour pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, oesophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia).\n\n'''Identification of an abnormal mediastinal image'''\n\nReading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum), which involves analysing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density (Figure 1).<gallery widths=\"650\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediastpedia1.jpg|'''Figure 1.

The management of errors and complaints; the therapeutic hazard\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Knowing the definition of liability, penalties and compensation\n|Description=None\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Bastien Boussat\n|Order=1}}\n\nThe liability of a healthcare professional or institution may be sought for two purposes: either to penalise the professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare. The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance. In addition to providing compensation for victims, this insurance covers salaried doctors when the fault is detachable from the service or when the mission entrusted to them is exceeded.\n\nIn order to receive compensation for the harmful consequences of a medical act, a user must prove that the act caused the damage, that it gave rise to liability and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage.\n\nIn terms of the liability of healthcare professionals and establishments, damage can take several forms. It may be :\n\n- physical or mental injury;\n\n- loss of chance of survival or recovery;\n\n- a loss of opportunity to have escaped a risk that ultimately materialised (in the case of failure to provide information).\n\nThe damage must be present and certain. It may be future if it is certain (for example, the sterility of a child as a result of faulty irradiation).\n\nThe causal link between the event giving rise to liability (generally fault) and the damage must be certain. It need not be direct or exclusive.\n\nOf the three elements of liability, causation is usually the most difficult for patients to prove. It is often difficult to distinguish the consequences of the fault from those of the spontaneous evolution of the pathological state of health. The courts accept that compensation may be awarded for loss of chance of survival or recovery. In this case, compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability of survival or recovery lost as a result of the fault.\n\nThe same reasoning applies in the case of a failure to provide information. In this case, the patient has lost a chance to escape the risk that ultimately materialised. In other words, if they had been informed of the risk, they could have chosen to run it or to forego the medical procedure. Compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability that the patient would have had of foregoing the procedure if he had been informed of the risk. As a result, if the procedure was essential, the judge concludes that even if the patient had been informed of the risk, he would not have decided to undergo the procedure. The loss of chance is therefore zero.\n\nThe courts and the administrative courts also accept that a failure to provide information gives rise to a right to compensation for loss of preparation, as distinct from loss of opportunity. When the risk of which the patient was unaware actually materialises, this compensation compensates the patient for any inconvenience he or she may have suffered as a result of not being able to prepare for this eventuality, in particular by making certain personal arrangements.",

Old symptoms are very rarely of infectious origin '''even if bacteriuria is demonstrated'''\n*The most frequent symptoms of the lower urinary tract (forget the term \"urinary incontinence and micturition disorders in adults and the elderly|urinary functional signs 125]\") are those of the filling phase:\n**pollakiuria\n**urinary urgency\n**incontinence sometimes\n*Dysuria is sometimes noted, but this is related to pollakiuria (the patient \"forces an empty bladder\" because the need is felt).\n*The main symptom = urinary burning\n*Other frequent symptoms: discreet [[Haematuria|haematuria 260]], pyuria, bladder tenesmus with pelvic pain/weight at the end of micturition.\n*On the other hand, these symptoms are the only way of expressing a \"bladder disorder\". Many pathologies (idiopathic overactive bladder, bladder tumour, etc.) manifest themselves in the same way. It is often a careful history that helps to distinguish between a recent and an old event.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Remember that the evolution of simple cystitis is not pyelonephritis!</u>''''\n\n<br />\n\n*In the absence of any anatomical or functional abnormality, cystitis does not become pyelonephritis (hence the classification of cystitis at risk of complications). This rare complication accounts for less than 1% of cystitis cases. This explains why the clinical presentation of ANP is febrile back pain without any lower urinary tract symptoms.",

Patients without a precise diagnosis at the latest one year after the first specialist consultation are limited to those for whom the state of the scientific, medical and technical art does not allow a precise diagnosis to be made. These patients are then said to be at a diagnostic impasse. When faced with unusual clinical signs (e.g. symptoms at an earlier age than usual), and/or an incoherent set of symptoms, health professionals should make it a reflex to suggest a rare disease.\n\nThe national organisation is highly structured and is based on the following elements (https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/soins-et-maladies/prises-en-charge-specialisees/maladies-rares/):\n\n- '''Centres de référence maladies rares''' (CRMR): A CRMR is a \"network\" comprising a coordinating site, one or more constituent sites and, where appropriate, one or more centres of competence (CCMR) or resource and competence centres.

It involves examinations carried out on pregnant women to diagnose a disease (infectious, haematological, genetic, etc.) in the foetus.\n\nIf a risk has already been identified in the family, the couple can decide to\n\n- the absence of any particular action and the assumption of the stated risk;\n\n- adoption ;\n\n- a request for prenatal diagnosis ;\n\n- a request for pre-implantation diagnosis.\n\nAntenatal diagnosis can also be carried out following the identification of an anomaly during pregnancy monitoring (biological or ultrasound). The couple's proposal for an examination is discussed at the CPDPN (Multidisciplinary Centre for Prenatal Diagnosis). The couple is then offered genetic tests ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]) which require invasive sampling to collect foetal material (cells, DNA), most often by chorionic villus puncture or amniocentesis.\n\no Fetal karyotype if an abnormality in chromosome number is suspected;\n\no Chromosomal analysis on a DNA chip (ACPA or CGH array) in cases of suspected unbalanced chromosomal abnormality other than an abnormal number;\n\no Targeted sequencing/analysis in cases of suspected gene syndrome or genetic disease identified in the family;\n\no Some centres are beginning to offer exome testing in cases where there is a suspicion of a gene syndrome but no clear indication;\n\n\nIf a woman is diagnosed with a particularly serious illness that is incurable at the time of diagnosis, she may request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG) on medical grounds, regardless of the term. This request is discussed at a CPDPN and may be accepted if the illness meets the 2 criteria mentioned above:\n\n- Particular gravity ;\n\n- Incurable at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThe CPDPN can also suggest drug therapies and, in rare cases, surgery to treat the foetus, as in the case of diaphragmatic hernia.\n\n\n'''Prenatal screening for trisomy 21'''\n\nDoctors must inform patients of the possibility of [[Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 SD-307|prenatal screening for trisomy 21]], which is covered by the health insurance scheme. This screening must be preceded by information to the patient about trisomy 21 and the screening procedures, and requires her prior written consent. The screening process is not compulsory and the patient may withdraw from the process at any time.\n\nScreening enables a risk to be assessed, but does not provide a definitive diagnosis. In the event of positive screening, the definitive diagnosis will be made by carrying out a foetal karyotype.\n\nIn the event of a confirmed diagnosis of trisomy 21, it is essential to arrange a systematic consultation with a geneticist to provide information on the prognosis and genetic counselling, prior to any decision to terminate a pregnancy for medical reasons, even if the parents decide to do so in advance.",

It is characterised by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.\n\nHorton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) is the cause to be considered first, even though it is not the most common cause, due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered as an \"emergency\". A systematic search should therefore be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease; changes in the temporal arteries; suggestive ocular signs (episode(s) of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography, indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), temporal artery biopsy (this should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralisation and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids as a matter of urgency.\n\nArteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. One or more risk factors are generally present: smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.\n\n=== '''Papilledema''' ===\nThis is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.\n\nIn cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.\n\n=== '''Retro-bulbar optic neuritis (RBON)''' ===\nDamage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.\n\n\nOther causes of optic nerve damage include:\n\n- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: these neuropathies have in common that they are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead), metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).\n\n- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumours or tumours in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n== Damage to the optic chiasm ==\nCompression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as \"chiasmatic syndrome\" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e. a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibres which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.\n\n== Retrochiasmatic disease ==\nThis results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibres travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive haematoma), tumour and trauma.\n\nA sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumour etiology.",

After birth, skin-to-skin contact with the mother should be encouraged if the condition of the newborn and the mother allow it. Early initiation of breastfeeding (within the first hour) should be offered if breastfeeding is desired. Clinical examinations and care of the newborn are carried out in the presence of the parents.  Staying in hospital after giving birth is a good opportunity to support the parents and learn how to care for the newborn. This period also provides an opportunity to observe the family and identify any psycho-social difficulties.\n# Breastfeeding (Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding)  The WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. Breastfeeding has many advantages: - a nutritional model adapted to physiological needs; - reduced risk of infection; - prevention of atopy; - contribution to the mother-child bond; - economic advantage.  Breastfeeding should begin early (within the first hour of life). The mother should be given information on :  - correct positioning of the newborn; - correct latching of the baby; - nipple hygiene; - stopping smoking and alcohol consumption; - the frequency and duration of feeds (breastfeeding on demand, 8 to 12 feeds); - assessing the effectiveness of breastfeeding (stools several times a day, copious urination, weight gain 200-250g per week);  - administration of vitamin K at 1 month of age and daily administration of vitamin D (1000 to 1200 IU); - complications of breastfeeding (insufficient lactation, sore and cracked nipples, engorgement, lymphangitis); - start of dietary diversification between 4 and 6 months of age.  Contraindications to breastfeeding are rare (maternal HIV infection, maternal heart or kidney disease, galactosemia in children, certain drugs).\n# Regular medical check-ups (14 medical examinations during the first 3 years, including 1 in the first week, 1 in the second week and one a month until the child is 6 months old); - Preventive measures (unexpected infant death syndrome, transmission of infections, domestic accidents)'''(Prevention of [[Unexpected infant death syndrome : definitions 2C-345-DE-A01|unexplained death]] of infants, [[Prevention of domestic accidents SD-325|Prevention of domestic accidents]])'''; - Risks associated with passive smoking; - Prompt medical consultation in the event of fever before 3 months, eating difficulties, respiratory discomfort, diarrhoea, vomiting, unusual behaviour (''''[[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]]'''); - Vaccinations: check the parents' anti-pertussis vaccination and inform them of the child's vaccination schedule ('''[[Vaccinations for adults and children SD-322|Vaccinations]]] for adults and children)'''; - Sun protection; - Information on shaken baby syndrome ('''Suspicion [[Abuse and children at risk.

The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.\n\n=== '''Epidemiology''' ===\nThe main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex and a family history of AAA.\n\nAAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs).\n\nThe prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.\n\n=== '''Natural history''' ===\nThe diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be \"fast-growing\" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year.\n\nThe risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm.\n\nFor the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.\n\n=== '''Other aneurysmal locations''' ===\n\n==== Popliteal artery aneurysms ====\nAAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, but most often in the popliteal arteries.\n\nAneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases).\n\nA popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived) or during ultrasound exploration (for example during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia or, more rarely, stress ischaemia.\n\nThe main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high.\n\nRarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis.\n\nRupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.\n\n==== Aneurysms of the iliac or femoral arteries ====\nMore rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.\n\n==== Thoracic aortic aneurysms ====\nAAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.",

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation centre (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, \"15\", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.\n\n\n'''Emergency call management:''' The call is initially taken by a '''medical regulation assistant''' (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a \"medical regulator (MR)\" who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the \"need for care and commit the necessary resources\": this is \"act I\" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognised by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an \"advisory role\", advising a witness or the patient him/herself on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources: this assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest, for example. The rest of the intervention (\"act II\" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs in order to organise the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.\n\n'''Link to item 17''' Telemedicine, telehealth and telehealth services.\n\n\n'''Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de Réanimation (SMUR)''': The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to '''take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital'', of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu. SMURs may specialise in transporting children (SMUR Pédiatriques).\n\n\nStructures des urgences (SU)'' : A hospital service, the SU is responsible for ''dealing with unscheduled admissions'' to a public or private health establishment, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, of any unselected person presenting in an emergency situation, including psychiatric emergencies''. Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalised around the ''reception organising nurse'' (IOA). The ED is generally organised into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a paediatric care unit. There is usually also a \"short\" rapid care pathway and a \"long\" pathway (patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalisation).",

These contributions are for health, maternity, disability and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the \"contribution solidarité autonomie\" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.\n\nSocial security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favour of fiscal resources, on the one hand the CSG (general social contribution), and on the other hand exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include: transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme); taxes on products (taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance, etc.); taxes on wages and labour; taxes on income and wealth: this is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG, plus the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). State public contributions'' finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidise schemes.\n\nGraph 1: Origin of social protection resources (pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners).<gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig 1.png\n</gallery>Source: DREES.

This person may be placed under a legal protection measure, which consists of appointing another person to assist or represent them in their interests.\n\nThere are several forms of personal protection, the three main ones being legal protection, curatorship and guardianship [[Learn about the three main forms of protection OIC-009-11-A#sdfootnote1sym|<sup>1</sup>]].\n\n'''1) Safeguard of justice:'''\n\nSafeguard of justice is a temporary protective measure with limited effects, used to deal with an emergency situation where a person of legal age is at risk of taking action contrary to his or her interests.\n\nIt is taken pending either the person's recovery or the pronouncement of a curatorship or guardianship measure.\n\nIn its form, the safeguard of justice can be :\n\n- medical, resulting from a statement made by a doctor (either the doctor of the person to be protected or the doctor of the health establishment where the person is) to the public prosecutor.\n\n- judicial, i.e. requested by the guardianship judge, in particular if an application is made to the judge to place the person under guardianship or curatorship.\n\nThe person under court protection retains the capacity to perform all acts, but certain important acts (e.g. the sale of a property) may be specially entrusted to a proxy.\n\n'''2) Guardianship and curatorship:'''\n\nThe difference between guardianship and curatorship lies in the degree of constraint imposed by these measures. The consequences of establishing guardianship are greater than those of curatorship.\n\nA person placed under guardianship remains autonomous in everyday life, but must be accompanied by a guardian for important acts. The guardianship judge defines the actions that the person may or may not take on their own, depending on their condition.\n\nGuardianship is a more protective measure. A guardian represents the adult to be protected in everyday life. The guardianship judge determines which acts the protected person may or may not perform alone.\n\nThere are three types of acts defined by law: acts that the protected person can carry out themselves (e.g. shopping); acts that require the guardian's authorisation (e.g. renewing an identity card); acts that require the guardianship judge's authorisation (e.g. changing residence).\n\nThe duration of the protective measure is determined by the guardianship judge. If the protected person's condition does not seem likely to improve, the guardianship judge may decide to renew the guardianship.\n\n'''3) Protection of minors:''''\n\nGuardianship of a minor is a legal protection measure whereby another person helps to protect the minor's interests when the holders of parental authority can no longer exercise them. In this case, the judge appoints a family council, which appoints a guardian and a subrogated guardian (a person appointed by the family council to represent the protected person when the latter's interests conflict with those of the guardian. This person has an obligation to monitor the management of the guardian).\n\n'''To find out about the main implications of these protective measures, particularly as regards the rights of protected patients of full age, please refer to the previous knowledge objective (OIC-009-10-B Principles and purposes of personal protection measures)'''.\n\n[Knowing the three main protection measures OIC-009-11-A#sdfootnote1anc|1]] This text borrows from several documents published by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Solidarity, Autonomy and the Disabled and the Ministry of Health and Prevention, and from consultations on justice.fr, solidarités-santé.gouv.fr, service-public.fr.",

It is an a posteriori approach to risk. A risk has occurred resulting in harm to a patient. This harm may be real or perceived by the patient.\n\nAn in-depth analysis of errors and the reasons for complaints will enable us to identify ways of preventing further errors by implementing improvement measures.\n\n'''Basics of in-depth analysis of error causes'''\n\n'''Reason's model'''\n\nReason's model (or the Swiss cheese model) is the model most often presented. It has the advantage of drawing attention to the latent causes of an accident, distinguishing between active and latent errors.\n\nThis helps us to understand that human error is most often only a consequence of deeper organisational flaws. This model proposes an analysis of undesirable events in successive sequences in which the different levels of defence existing at each stage have been overcome. This concept of successive barriers has now been replaced by a systemic model, which is too complex to be detailed here.\n\n'''Safety barriers'''\n\nBarriers are in-depth defences (protections) against the risk of error. There are three types of safety barriers:\n\n- prevention barriers ;\n\n- recovery barriers ;\n\n- mitigation barriers.\n\nAn effective safety system must have all three. Neither recovery nor mitigation barriers should be neglected.\n\nThese three types of barriers can be :\n\n- intangible: laws and regulations, instructions, good safety practice, recommendations, procedures and protocols, training programmes, work organisation, etc. ;\n\n- material: physical coding (e.g. special design of medical gas and vacuum connection rings to prevent inappropriate connections of different colours).\n\n'''Prevention barriers'''\n\nThey are designed to prevent errors and accidents from occurring: for example, the surgical checklist, an intangible barrier that breaks down into three stages (Box 5.4), or computerised prescribing in a system that provides alerts based on dangerous doses, the patient's clinical and biological condition, drug interactions, etc.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Inset: Operating theatre checklist adapted from the HAS checklist grid, 2011 version''''\n|-\n|'''''Before anaesthetic induction'''''\n\n'''''Pause time before induction'''''\n\n- Verification of :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. procedure and surgical site (patient, records)\n\n. availability of clinical and paraclinical documentation\n\n. knowledge of the installation method, consistent with the site/intervention, not dangerous for the patient\n\n. skin preparation of the patient being operated on, documented in the department/operating theatre liaison sheet\n\n. equipment/materials required for the operation, with no malfunctions\n\n- Cross-check by the risk team :\n\n. allergic\n\n. inhalation\n\n. intubation difficulties\n\n. ventilation\n\n. bleeding\n\n'''Before surgery'''\n\n'''Pause time before incision'''\n\n- Ultimate\" cross-check within the team, in the presence of the surgeon(s), anaesthetist(s)/IADE, IBODE/IDE :\n\n. patient identity\n\n. planned intervention\n\n. surgical site\n\n. correct installation\n\n. availability of the necessary documents\n\n- Sharing information orally within the team on the elements at risk/critical stages of the intervention (time out) in terms of :\n\n. surgical\n\n. anaesthetic\n\n- In accordance with current protocols:\n\n. administration of antibiotic prophylaxis\n\n. preparation of the operating field\n\n'''After surgery'''\n\n'''Break before leaving the operating theatre'''\n\n- Oral confirmation by staff to the team:\n\n. of the recorded intervention\n\n. the correct final count of compresses, needles, instruments, etc.\n\n. labelling of samples, operating theatres, etc.\n\n. if any undesirable events or medical risks have occurred: report/notification\n\n- Prescriptions for immediate post-operative care are made jointly by the surgical and anaesthetic teams.\n\n\nN.B: IADE: state-qualified nurse anaesthetist; IBODE: state-qualified operating theatre nurse; IDE: state-qualified nurse.\n|}\n'''Recovery barriers''''\n\nThe mistake has been made but recovered before it has any consequences. For example, the patient is allergic to penicillin, which is the antibiotic prophylaxis prescribed before surgery, but the nurse reads about it in the medical record and alerts the prescriber, who changes the prescription.\n\n'''Mitigation barriers'''\n\nThe error has been made and has not been recovered. The aim is to limit the consequences for the patient. For example, a patient suffers cardiac arrest as a result of an error in the route of administration made by a nurse. She notifies the senior doctor as soon as she realises the error. The medical team is on site and starts cardiac massage while the SOS cardiac arrest team called in immediately arrives. The electric shock restored cardiac function, and the patient was transferred to intensive care for stabilisation and monitoring. He was discharged the next day.\n\nRoot cause analysis\n\nThe root causes of a medical error should be sought in the overall context surrounding the undesirable event.\n\nThe analysis methods are structured to avoid oversights. The most commonly used methods are the ALARM method and the Orion® method. Root cause analysis methods generally include the following six steps for proper application:\n\n1/ Data collection: semi-structured interviews with all the people present at the time of the event, files, any other documents needed to understand the events;\n\n2/ reconstructing the chronology of the event;\n\n3/ Identifying deviations from recommended practices, without judging against an existing benchmark;\n\n4/ identification of contributing factors: immediate and deep or root causes (boxes 5.5)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Box: Typology of contributing factors or root causes (according to the ALARM method)''''\n|-\n|'''''Factors may be linked:'''''\n\n- the patient: state of health, seriousness of associated illnesses, communication difficulties (language, conflict with carers, etc.), vulnerability of certain patient populations (the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, children, adolescents, people with disabilities, the underprivileged, etc.);\n\n- the tasks to be carried out ;\n\n- to the team: communication within the team and with the patient in the therapeutic relationship, traceability of information in the patient file, supervision of junior staff undergoing training;\n\n- the working environment: physical (premises, equipment, supplies, etc.) or organisational (availability of qualified human resources, work organisation, working hours, etc.);\n\n- organisation and management: policies for replacing absent staff (no replacement, temporary staff, travel), continuous training, equipment management, etc;\n\n- the institutional context: national and regional public health policies, adverse event reporting systems, etc.\n|}\n5/ Proposed actions to be implemented (accompanied by an action plan) ;\n\n6/ drafting the analysis report.",

It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It affects one in every 4,700 births.  One subject in 35 is a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in France is F508del.  Life expectancy at birth is over 40 years.\n\nSituations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis\n\n- Ultrasound monitoring\n\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be raised during ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy when a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign which may reveal a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in around 5% of cases. This risk is increased if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by an absence of visualization of the gallbladder. A study of the CFTR gene is then carried out in the couple.

The selection criteria are based on :\n\n*L'''' authorisation de mise sur le marché'' (AMM) of the medicinal product in a ''precise indication''. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and carried out under strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.\n*The \"level of evidence\" of the drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should always be guided by the ''highest level of evidence'', and where the level of evidence is equal, preference should be given to the medicinal product with the greatest experience of use.\n*The patient's ''pre-therapeutic assessment'', the ''therapeutic objective'' defined and the individual benefit-risk ratio previously established for this patient.\n\n==Treatment evaluation\nOnce the prescription has been made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers :\n\n*The ''efficacy of the treatment'', which must be consistent with the therapeutic objective defined above.\n*Assessment of the drug's ''safety profile'', which will focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.\n*Drug monitoring, based on clinical data (e.g. blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g. blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment) and pharmacovigilance data, pharmacological therapeutic monitoring OIC-321-02-A|pharmacological therapeutic monitoring]]'' (measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation, for example).\n\nThese elements of treatment evaluation enable the \"benefit-risk ratio\" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period, and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.",

DCs are usually very effective in the short term against AD flare-ups. Long-term efficacy studies are very rare. DCs are classified according to their potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak activity) and their galenic form (cream, ointment, lotion and gel).\n\n\n'''The choice of a DC depends on four criteria: age, location of lesions, extent to be treated and oozing nature of lesions.'''\n\n\n<u>choice of galenical</u>:\n\n-ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas\n\n-cream for oozing areas, folds and large skin surfaces\n\n-lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children)\n\n- scalp gel (rarely used in children)\n\n<u>The choice of activity level</u>\n\n-Very strong DCs are contraindicated on infants and young children, and on the face, folds and seat.\n\nHigh-activity CDs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated in children on lichenified lesions, on the extremities and on lesions resistant to moderate-activity CDs.      \n\nModerate-activity CDs are used on the face and body of infants and children.\n\nlow-activity CDs are of no interest because they have little or no efficacy.\n\nnumber of applications per day\n\nA single application per day is just as effective as several applications, and makes it easier to adhere to treatment.  \n\n<u>quantity to be applied</u>\n\nThere is no maximum quantity recommended during the initial treatment.\n\nThe amount required to maintain remission during maintenance treatment should not normally exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity CD for children and 60 g/month of high-activity CD for adults.\n\nDuring the maintenance period, it has been shown in children and adults that the systematic use of a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on the skin areas usually affected for 4 months reduced the number of flare-ups without side-effects. This method of using DCs (pro-active treatment) is particularly suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups that recur rapidly when DCs are stopped.\n<br />\n\n=== 3) Emollients ===\nEmollients improve the functional signs of skin dryness and some of them temporarily restore the skin's barrier function.\n\nThe use of emollients is recommended by professional agreement from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as a maintenance treatment throughout the duration of AD, regardless of its severity.\n\nprecautions for use:\n\ninterruption for a few days during a highly inflammatory flare-up (frequently poor tolerance)\n\n-Galenics to be adapted to the patient's preferences\n\nFragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitisation. ATTENTION: emollients are not reimbursed by the health insurance scheme, with the exception of atopiclair®, generics of dexeryl© (reimbursable at 15%) and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.\n<br />\n\n=== 4) Therapeutic education ===\nThe aim of therapeutic education is to teach patients how to live optimally with a chronic disease. It is a process integrated into care, adapted to the patient's needs, which includes a range of information and learning techniques provided by one or more carers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, .....) during programmes involving consultation(s) and/or meetings in small groups. The aim is to help patients and/or their families become more independent, to encourage them to adhere to treatment and to combat corticophobia, which is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\nOther treatments :\n\noral antihistamines (anti-H1): no proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase apart from an old study / interest in hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during the flare-up period in young children with sleep disorders\n\n\n-Topical immunomodulator: tacrolimus (in France) - indicated for flare-ups of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (facial lesions++).\n\n\n-Systemic treatments: treatment of severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors.
