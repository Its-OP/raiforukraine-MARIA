To summarise :\n\nThe bone marrow failure syndrome may give rise to complications linked to the depth of anaemia (myocardial damage), thrombocytopenia (haemorrhagic shock, cerebral bleeding), neutropenia (septic shock); the tumour syndrome may be complicated by hyperleukocytosis (leukostasis), compressive forms (superior cava syndrome), neurological damage (meningeal damage), lysis syndrome (acute renal failure, hyperkalaemia); AML, and particularly AML3, frequently leads to haemostasis disorders (DIC with risk of multivisceral dysfunction syndrome due to microthrombotic damage and risk of haemorrhage).\n\n<br />",
