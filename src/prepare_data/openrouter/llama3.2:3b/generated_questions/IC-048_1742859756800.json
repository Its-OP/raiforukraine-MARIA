It should be started for all children between 4 and 6 months of age.\n\nIts nutritional value is marginal, as almost all the nutritional needs of infants up to the age of 12 months are met by their mother's milk or infant formula.\n\nThe role of diversification is mainly to introduce :\n\n- new food proteins to help them acquire tolerance,\n\n- new flavours for optimal taste development,\n\n- pieces to encourage the development of chewing,\n\n- fibre to help the intestinal microbiota adapt to a diet that is not exclusively milk-based.",
