Glomerular nephropathy 261 (to be considered if the haematuria is associated with: glomerular proteinuria, +/- hypertension and\n\u00b1 renal failure) confirmed by renal biopsy:\nAcquired recurrent macroscopic haematuria syndrome: suggestive of primary IgA nephropathy (mostly in young men: macroscopic haematuria 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection) or congenital: Alport syndrome (family background, deafness, ophthalmological involvement).\n- in children, persistent microscopic haematuria should prompt a search for a glomerular cause:\n- Alport syndrome: microscopic or macroscopic haematuria;\n- acute nephritic syndrome: acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis.\n\nAcute nephritic syndrome: most often post-infectious GN (10-15 days after streptococcal ENT infection),\nhypocomplementemia\nRapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): rapid deterioration in renal function with glomerular syndrome (proteinuria + haematuria)\n+/- extra-renal signs revealing systemic disease / vasculitis\n\n\nB. Acute interstitial nephropathy 262: most often immuno-allergic (often drug-induced), it may combine\nhaematuria with leucocyturia and renal failure +/- signs of the allergic series (skin rash, cytolysis, etc.).\ncytolysis, etc.).\n \n\nC. Nephrological causes with urological clinical presentation (haematuria due to invasion of the urinary tree, responsible for\nlumbar pain) :\nPapillary necrosis: migration of papillary fragments into the ureter, mimicking nephritic colic, on a favourable\n(diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, use of NSAIDs, etc.).\nRenal infarction: haematuria with sudden lumbar pain, requiring emergency treatment if it involves the\nthe main trunk of the renal artery. Thromboembolic or vascular disease, sickle cell disease or post\ntrauma.\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 266: development of renal cysts in which the vessels in the wall may rupture.\nvessels may rupture in the excretory tract, causing haematuria. Haematuria can also reveal\nstones or cyst infection. Progression to chronic renal failure",
