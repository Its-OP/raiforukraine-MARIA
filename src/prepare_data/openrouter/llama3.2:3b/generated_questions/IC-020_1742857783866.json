Example: general cancer register in Gironde.\n*** Compulsory declaration'': at national level, around thirty diseases (mainly infectious) must be declared to the regional health agencies (centralised by Sant\u00e9 Publique France) by the health professionals who diagnose them. Examples of notifiable diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, HIV.\n*** Sentinelles Network: primary care research and monitoring network (based on a network of volunteer doctors in general practice and paediatrics) in mainland France, providing continuous monitoring of 10 health indicators (under the supervision of INSERM and Sorbonne University, in collaboration with Sant\u00e9 Publique France). Examples of health indicators: influenza syndromes, chickenpox, whooping cough, acute diarrhoea, suicidal acts.\n*** Vital statistics'': at national level, information relating to the death of individuals is collected from death certificates (exhaustive and permanent collection). Medical data on causes of death are analysed by the Centre d'Epid\u00e9miologie sur les causes m\u00e9dicales de d\u00e9c\u00e8s (C\u00e9piDC), with the production of annual statistics (in collaboration with INSEE, based on civil status records from town halls).\n** Medico-administrative databases, for example in France:\n*** '''Syst\u00e8me National des Donn\u00e9es de Sant\u00e9 (SNDS)''': grouping together in a system of continuously and exhaustively recorded data from the Assurance Maladie (SNIIRAM base with consumption of care, drugs, ALDs, etc.), hospitals (PMSI base with diagnoses and reasons for hospitalisation, procedures carried out in hospital, etc.), the C\u00e9picDC (medical causes of death), the Caisse Nationale de Solidarit\u00e9 pour l'Autonomie (CNSA, data relating to disability), etc.\n*** ''Entrep\u00f4ts hospitaliers de donn\u00e9es de sant\u00e9 (EDS)'': integrating the administrative and medical data (medical records, radiological and biological examinations, etc.) of patients who are hospitalised or come for consultation",
