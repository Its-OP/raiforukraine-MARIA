The trisomy 21 screening policy proposed in France has led some to think of it as a eugenic policy. However, this screening is proposed rather than imposed, and at each stage of the process the patient is given information so that, on the one hand, she can decide not to continue with the screening procedure and, on the other, once the diagnosis has been made, she can choose to welcome a child with trisomy 21. The principle of patient autonomy is therefore preserved. In France, for a variety of reasons ranging from the material difficulties encountered by families (identification or accessibility of support adapted to the needs of the child and then the adult carrying trisomy 21) to societal pressure, around 90% of couples choose to request a medical termination of pregnancy.",
