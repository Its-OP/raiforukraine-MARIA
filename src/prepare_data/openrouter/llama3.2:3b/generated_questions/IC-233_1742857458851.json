In severe AI: holodiastolic murmur, diastolic Flint roll, gallop, pistol-shot, etc.\n* Peripheral signs: peripheral hyperpulsatility and increase in differential BP due to a fall in diastolic pressure (< 50 mmHg = severe AI).\n* Left heart failure'' (late)\n\nMitral stenosis: asymptomatic for a long time, may be revealed by pregnancy or transition to AF\n\n* Functional signs: dyspnoea, asthenia, palpitations.\n* Auscultation: mitral focus diastolic rolling, B1 burst if valve is flexible, B2 splitting if PAH (Durozier 3-step rhythm)\n* Left and right heart failure, AF, signs of pulmonary hypertension, haemoptysis.\n\n<br />",
