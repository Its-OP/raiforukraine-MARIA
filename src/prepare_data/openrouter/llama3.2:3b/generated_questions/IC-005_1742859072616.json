They are also known as healthcare-associated infections. This means that these infections were not present when the patient was admitted to the establishment. However, if the patient's infectious state on admission is unknown, the infection is generally considered to be nosocomial if it appears after 48 hours of hospitalisation. If it appears before this time, it is generally considered to have been incubating when the patient was admitted to the hospital.",
