It is based on a full clinical examination looking for :\n\n- Clinical cardiological signs (dyspnoea, chest pain, palpitation, syncope)\n\n- The presence of an unknown murmur or a change in a previous murmur\n\n- Any signs of infection (fever, AEG, sweating)\n\n- Regular monitoring of INR if necessary\n\n- Prevention of infective endocarditis by monitoring compliance with dental and ENT care\n\nIn the event of any abnormality, a cardiologist should be consulted as a matter of course.\n\n\nCardiological monitoring is carried out once a year, starting in the first year.\n<br />\n\n==== '''''Paraclinical follow-up''''' ====\nRadiological follow-up is not systematic. Chest X-rays are generally indicated in cases of abnormal clinical examination (signs of overload, increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette).\n\nECG monitoring is carried out by the cardiologist and at least once a year by the attending physician.\n\nPatients undergoing anticoagulation with VKAs have their INR monitored on a monthly basis. A biological check-up, including a blood count and ionogram, is carried out annually by the attending physician.\n\nEchocardiographic monitoring is carried out annually by the cardiologist (TTE and possibly TEE in the event of atypia or doubt).",
