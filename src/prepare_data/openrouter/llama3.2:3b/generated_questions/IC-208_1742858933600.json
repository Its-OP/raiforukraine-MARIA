Close gas monitoring should assess the impact of oxygen therapy on PaCO2.\n\nIn the event of significant alveolar hypoventilation, nocturnal non-invasive ventilation may be initiated in addition to oxygen therapy. The clinical and gasometric criteria for initiating long-term NIV vary according to the underlying pathologies.",
