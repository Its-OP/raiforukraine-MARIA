This register will be automatically consulted before any removal procedure.\n\nSince 1 January 2017, all deceased persons diagnosed as brain dead have been considered as donors by default''''''''' If a person is opposed to the removal of blood during their lifetime, they must register on the national refusal register or provide their next of kin with oral or written testimony. Relatives may testify to the refusal, but they must sign an official document certifying the deceased's refusal.\n\nTable 3 summarises the main laws governing organ transplantation in France.\n\nTable 3: Important laws governing transplantation activities\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Text\n|Content\n|-\n|Circular Jeanneney (1968)\n|Definition of brain death criteria\n|-\n|Caillavet Law (1976)\n|Presumed consent for the deceased donor\n\nChoice freely and expressly consented to by the living donor\n|-\n|Bioethics law (1994)\n|Living donors of full age and related (father/mother, son/daughter, brother/sister)\n\nDeceased donors not on the national refusal register (implied consent, testimony requested from the family)\n\nCreation of the \u00c9tablissement fran\u00e7ais des Greffes (EfG).\n|-\n|1st revision of the bioethics law (2004)\n|Expansion of the circle of living donors: father, mother, spouse, brother or sister, son or daughter, grandparent, uncle or aunt, first cousin, spouse of father or mother, any person providing proof that they have lived together with the recipient for at least 2 years.\n\nPre-transplant living donor committees\n\nAnnual follow-up of living donors after transplantation\n|-\n|2nd revision of the French Bioethics Act (2011)\n|Widening the circle of living donors:\n\nany person providing proof of a close and stable affective relationship with the recipient for at least 2 years;\n\ncross-donation of kidneys limited to two donor-recipient pairs.\n\nsocial protection for living donors\n|}",
