These contributions are for health, maternity, disability and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the \"contribution solidarit\u00e9 autonomie\" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.\n\nSocial security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favour of fiscal resources, on the one hand the CSG (general social contribution), and on the other hand exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include: transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme); taxes on products (taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance, etc.); taxes on wages and labour; taxes on income and wealth: this is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG, plus the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). State public contributions'' finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidise schemes.\n\nGraph 1: Origin of social protection resources (pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners).<gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig 1.png\n</gallery>Source: DREES.

There is a decline in the share of social contributions due to the drop in professional activity during 2020 (confinements). This illustrates the importance of economic activity in generating financial resources for social protection.<gallery>\nFile:19 G2 resources.png\n</gallery>",
