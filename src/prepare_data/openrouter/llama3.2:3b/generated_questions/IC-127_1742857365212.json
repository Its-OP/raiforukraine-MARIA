The key parameters in its interpretation are the maximum flow rate and the shape of the curve.\n**A urine volume >150mL provides a more reliable assessment.\n**A maximum flow rate < 15ml/s is considered pathological.\n**A normal curve is bell-shaped, whereas a flat curve indicates an emptying disorder.\n\n<br />[[File:Item 127.jpg|vignette|611x611px|alt=|neant]]\n\n*Post-micturition residue: the presence of a significant quantity of urine (more than 100ml) in the bladder after micturition. It is assessed using ultrasound or a device such as Bladder Scan\u00a9.\n\nA post-micturition residue is not in itself an indication for surgery, especially as a residue may be linked to subvesical obstruction or bladder hypoactivity.\n\n\n\n<br />",
