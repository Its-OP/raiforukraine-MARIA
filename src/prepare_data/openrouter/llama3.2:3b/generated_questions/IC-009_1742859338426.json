The application is made using a form that is easily accessible on Service-public.fr\n\n'''The issue of a detailed medical certificate:'''\n\nAny request to the guardianship judge to open a protection measure must be accompanied by a medical certificate describing any impairment of the person's faculties and the foreseeable evolution, and specifying the consequences of this impairment on the need for assistance or representation.\n\nThe certificate must be drawn up by a doctor chosen from a list drawn up by the public prosecutor. Recently, the doctor drawing up the certificate has been able to request the opinion of the person's GP.\n\n'''Investigation of the request:'''\n\nIt is the guardianship judge who decides whether an adult should benefit from a protective measure. To do this, the judge will hold a hearing with the person to be protected, who may be assisted by a lawyer or accompanied, subject to the judge's agreement, by any person of his or her choice. The hearing may also be attended by the protected person's GP.\n\nThe judge will automatically hear the person who filed the application for protection.\n\n'''Appointment of curator or guardian:'''\n\nThe judge appoints one or more tutors or curators.\n\nThe tutor or curator is chosen first and foremost from among the relatives of the person to be protected. If this is not possible, the judge will appoint a professional, known as a legal representative for the protection of adults.\n\nBoth guardianship and curatorship can be divided between a guardian (or curator) responsible for the protection of the person (for example, in the event of marriage) and a guardian (curator) responsible for the management of assets (for example, to make tax returns).\n\n'''The different types of curatorship:'''\n\nThere are three types of guardianship (simple, strengthened and adjusted), which restrict to a greater or lesser extent the acts that the person to be protected can carry out, in order to meet the needs of the person to be protected as closely as possible.\n\n'''L'habilitation familiale et le mandat de protection future :'''\n\nFamily authorisation allows a close relative (parent, child, grandparent, brother, sister, spouse, cohabitee, PACS partner) to represent a person. This authorisation is given by the judge when the person is unable to express his or her wishes on a day-to-day basis, or to perform or understand acts of daily life. It may be general or limited to certain acts. Entitlement enables the person representing the person to act on their behalf. The empowered person carries out his or her duties free of charge.\n\nThe future protection mandate allows any adult to designate in advance one or more persons (called a mandatary) to represent him or her on the day when he or she is no longer able to manage his or her interests.\n\n'''Conditions for the termination of guardianship, curatorship or safeguard of justice measures:'''\n\nA protective measure is terminated either by the death of the protected person or by a court decision to terminate the measure, noting that the causes that gave rise to the measure no longer exist.\n\nThe person concerned is released if their state of health improves.\n\nThe judge may decide to terminate the protection ex officio, and the persons who may apply for termination are the same as those who may apply for protection.\n\nAs with the application for protection, the judge's decision is based on a detailed, up-to-date medical certificate, which may be issued by the attending physician or another physician, and after hearing the person concerned and their guardian or curator.\n\nThe improvement or deterioration of the protected adult's situation always makes it possible to modify the protection regime''',''' in the sense of a reduction, a reinforcement (curatorship can be transformed into guardianship) or a change in its mode of exercise.\n\n\n\n[This text is based on several documents published by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Solidarity, Autonomy and the Disabled and the Ministry of Health and Prevention, as well as consultations on justice.fr, solidarit\u00e9s-sant\u00e9.gouv.fr and service-public.fr.",
