A reference laboratory should also be called in to repeat all the maternal samples in order to assess how far the infection has progressed and when it occurred.\n\n2) If seroconversion is confirmed during pregnancy, the patient should be referred to a Centre Pluridisciplinaire de Diagnostic Pr\u00e9natal (CPDPN) for further treatment. Anti-parasitic treatment will be initiated as soon as seroconversion is diagnosed. Treatment may be modified if the amniotic fluid PCR is positive.\n\n<br />",
