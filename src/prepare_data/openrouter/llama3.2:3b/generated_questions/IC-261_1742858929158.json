Relapse after discontinuation of treatment in 50% of cases, necessitating resumption of corticosteroid therapy.\n* Corticodependence: relapse after corticosensitivity occurring when corticosteroid therapy is reduced or rapidly after it is stopped. Often requires the addition of an immunosuppressant or immunomodulator.\n* Corticoresistance: non-response (10% of cases), risk (50%) of end-stage chronic renal failure within 5 years.\n\n<br />",
