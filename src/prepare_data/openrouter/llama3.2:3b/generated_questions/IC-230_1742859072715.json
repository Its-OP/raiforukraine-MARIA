They are associated with a myocardial territory (V1-V4: anteroseptoapical; DII, DIII, aVF: inferior; DI, aVL: high lateral and V5, V6: low lateral; V3R, V4R: right ventricle; V7 to V9: posterior). Classically, a distinction is made between two types\n\n*For '''acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation:''''\n**ST elevation \u2265 2 mm in precordial and \u2265 1 mm in inferior and high lateral),\n**in at least 2 contiguous leads of the same coronary territory.\n**Usually associated mirror sub-shift.\n**A new left bundle branch block is considered equivalent to ST+ if associated with a suggestive acute presentation.\n\n[[File:Image1.jpg|thumbnail|586x586px|SCA ST+ lower and lower lateral|alt=|centered]]<br />\n\n*For acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation (i.e. without persistent ST-segment elevation of more than 20 minutes):\n**may show ST-segment sub-shift (more reliable if horizontal or descending, see ECG 2),\n**negative T waves (see ECG 3)\n**or a normal ECG, particularly when post-critical.\n\n[[File:Image2.jpg|thumbnail|512x512px|SCA ST- |alt=|centered]]\n\n\n[[File:Image3.jpg|thumbnail|508x508px|SCA ST-|alt=|centered]]\n\n*for aortic dissection: ECG generally normal but may be ST+ if dissection extends to a coronary artery\n\n*For pulmonary embolism: (see ECG 4):\n**sinus tachycardia (>100/min),\n**S1Q3 appearance (S wave in DI and Q in DIII),\n**right bundle branch block,\n**negativation of T waves from V1 to V3 or even V4.\n**NB = ECG abnormalities may be absent.\n\n \n\n\n\u00a0\n[[File:Image4.jpg|vignette|513x513px|Pulmonary embolism: sinus tachycardia, SI QIII |alt=|centric]]\n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n* for pericarditis with tamponade\n** diffuse ST segment elevation (not systematised to a coronary territory) and concave upward ST segment elevation, without mirror, without Q wave,\n** sub-shift of the PQ then progression to diffuse negativation of the T waves\n** and finally normalisation of the ECG over several weeks.\n** other anomalies suggestive of tamponade: microvoltage, electrical alternation (variation in the amplitude of the QRS, generally 1 in 2).\n\n[[File:Pericarditis.jpg|thumbnail|672x672px|Pericarditis|alt=|centered]]\n\n\n       \n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",
