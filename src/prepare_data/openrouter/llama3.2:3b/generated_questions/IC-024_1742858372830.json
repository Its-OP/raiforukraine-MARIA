If the P/C ratio is less than 30, there is no significant proteinuria.\n\n'''On the foetal level'''\n\n- Obstetrical ultrasound + Doppler'' :\n\n- fetal biometrics with estimation of fetal weight\n\n- assesses growth with comparison to previous ultrasound scans where appropriate\n\n- in the case of IUGR: umbilical artery Doppler analysis (placental resistances) and biometric curves.\n\nFetuses with IUGR and no umbilical Doppler are at high risk of \"in utero\" foetal death and acidosis.\n\nRCF: Of limited interest in moderate and isolated hypertension, it is essential for monitoring severe forms and/or IUGR with pathological umbilical Doppler.",
