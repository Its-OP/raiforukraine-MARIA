The higher the number of CAG triplets, the earlier and more severe the onset of the disease.\n\nClinical signs include abnormal movements, psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.\n\nThe abnormal movements are primarily chorea, which spreads progressively and can affect the hands, feet, face and trunk. As the disease progresses, dystonic abnormal movements and a parkinsonian syndrome may be encountered.\n\nPsychiatric disorders often involving mood (sad mood, moral pain) and/or behaviour initially correspond to a change in personality, disinhibition, depression, [[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]], sometimes a suicide attempt or psychosis ([[Delusional ideas SD-124|delusional ideas]], rare [[Hallucinations SD-122|hallucinations]]).\n\nAssociated with this is a subcortical-frontal [[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|cognitive decline]] with a dysexecutive syndrome progressing to dementia. [Apathy SD-117|Apathy]] (lack of interest and motivation) and anosognosia are frequent.\n\nThere is usually a family history. There are sporadic forms, which can be misleading in cases of early death of one of the parents (censorship), false paternity or anticipation.\n\nThis condition involves the [[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]] and the [[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]]. The patient inevitably dies, with progressive [[Loss of autonomy SD-031|loss of autonomy]], a [[Situation of disability SD-345|situation of disability]], grabatisation, dementia with speech and swallowing disorders.
