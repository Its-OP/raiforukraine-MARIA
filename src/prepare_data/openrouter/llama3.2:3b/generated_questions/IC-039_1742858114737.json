It can be carried out with sperm from a spouse ('''IAC'') or from a donor ('''IAD'').\n\nInsemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to obtain maturation of one to three follicles, or induction of ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders ([[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|Menstrual Cycle Disorders]]: anovulation or dysovulation).  \n\nPelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation. This is known as ovulation monitoring.\n\nOvulation is triggered by injection of recombinant hCG to synchronise ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition.\n\nThe day after the induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory, under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected (similar to the migration-survival test, see LISA sheet for item 38). The sperm preparation is inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.            \n\n*In Vitro Fertilisation''''' conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.\n\n<u>Ovarian stimulation</u> under supervision (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) by administration of high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked at the same time by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n\nThese protocols require ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH and progesterone levels). The aim of this monitoring is to :\n\n*check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing),\n*choose the optimum day for ovulation induction,\n*identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g. insufficient ovarian response).\n\nOvulation is triggered when several follicles have reached a size greater than 16 mm by injection of either an hCG analogue (recombinant hCG) or a GnRH agonist.\n\n<u>Follicular puncture</u> (of the follicular fluid) is performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anaesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory where it is examined for cumulo-ovocyte complexes.\n\n<u>Sperm preparation</u> is carried out in the majority of cases using a '''sperm sample taken by masturbation'' on the day of the follicular puncture. However, it is also possible to use frozen sperm from a spouse or a third-party donor. It is also possible to use sperm taken surgically (either from testicular tissue (testicular biopsy) or from the liquid in the epididymis (epididymal puncture)) in cases of azoospermia (sperm which will then be used fresh or after freezing). Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinised urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). The spermatozoa recovered are prepared according to the \"in vitro\" fertilisation technique envisaged.\n\n<u>Fertilisation</u> is either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).\n\n<u>Culture and embryo transfer</u>: after fertilisation of the oocytes by sperm, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on a number of factors.\n\nA pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.\n\n<u>Embryo freezing</u>: non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and then kept in storage tanks containing liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are first thawed and then transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.\n\n\nThe MPA can be :\n\n*intra-marital'' (using the gametes, oocytes and spermatozoa of both members of the couple)\n*or with the intervention of a ''third party donor'' (sperm donor, oocyte donor or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure and for which the couple no longer have any parental plans).\n\nDouble gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible (French Bioethics Act 2021).\n\nPGM can be carried out in the context of \"viral risk\" (HIV, hepatitis B and/or C) in centres approved for this activity. Finally, one of the techniques used in MAP is \"pre-implantation diagnosis\" (PGD), the aim of which is to diagnose genetic anomalies (genes, chromosomes) in embryonic cells. Only a few AMP centres are authorised to carry out PGD in France.\n\n<br />",
