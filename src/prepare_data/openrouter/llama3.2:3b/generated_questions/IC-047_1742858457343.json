AEO may miss hearing loss due to auditory neuropathy (false negative).\n* Outside the neonatal period (subjective tests except tympanometry): child calm and quiet, reassurance.\n** Calibrated sound sources (Moatti box, sensory baby test): behavioural reaction to sound stimulation, acutropic reflex (from 6 months, turns head towards object) or investigative orientation. The younger the child, the greater the intensity of sound required to obtain a response. Clear responses at 70 dB = no bilateral deafness in infants.\n** Voice test: response to first name (after 6 months), familiar words, picture book (after 2 years), voice audiometry (after 4 years).\n** Headphone tonal audiometry if the child cooperates and understands (after 4 years).\n** Tympanometry: tubal obstruction or serous otitis.\n\n\nTo illustrate: video made by Surdi Iifo service with practical examples of tests on children: https://www.surdi.info/galerie-videos/detail/fiche/6-questions-surlexamen-de-laudition-chez-lenfant/",
