In children, this structure also plays a mechanical role, enveloping the bone. During fractures, its early activity leads to the rapid formation of a \"periosteal\" callus, which ensures early fracture stability and completes the consolidation of the fracture haematoma by the callus. Over time, after initial consolidation, it helps to remodel the callus and correct certain vicious calluses or secondary displacements.",
