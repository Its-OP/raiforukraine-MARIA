Progress depends in part on the therapeutic strategy. The risk of suicide is high, and the number of completed suicides is higher than in younger patients.\n\nFrequent association with non-psychiatric pathologies, either by increasing the risk of developing a depressive episode characterised by certain pathologies (dementia, cardiovascular pathologies, sensory impairment, cancer) or by the fact that a depressive episode increases the risk of occurrence or aggravation of certain non-psychiatric pathologies (cognitive impairment, or even progression to Alzheimer's disease or related illnesses, diabetes, coronary artery disease).\n\nSerotonergic antidepressants are the first-line treatment. For bipolar disorder, thymoregulators are the mainstay of treatment.\n\nFor psychotic disorders, second-generation antipsychotics should be used as first-line treatment. Treatment is identical to that for adults.\n\nFor BPSD, management must be comprehensive, with priority given to non-drug approaches. A non-psychiatric, iatrogenic or psychiatric cause must be ruled out. Drug strategies are reserved for severe BPSD. The benefit/risk ratio should be assessed regularly.",
