Their value therefore reflects the average pressure regime in the heart chambers.\n\n- normal values of BNP (<100 pg/ml) or NT-proBNP (<300 pg/ml) very unlikely diagnosis in the presence of acute dyspnoea Figure 2\n\n- BNP > 300 pg/ml or NT-proBNP with age-dependent threshold values:\n\no > 450 pg/ml in subjects under 50,\n\no > 900 pg/ml between the ages of 50 and 75,\n\no > 1800 pg/ml > 75 years of age).\n[[File:Interpretation of natriuretic peptides in the context of acute dyspnoea.png|vignette|369x369px|Interpretation of natriuretic peptides in the context of acute dyspnoea]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know to interpret the rates\n\n- Increases with age in women\n\n- Decreases with obesity\n\n- Increased in cases of renal insufficiency or atrial fibrillation\n\n- Treatment with ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor), represented by the combination of Sacubitril and Valsartan (Entresto\u00ae), leads to an increase in BNP concentrations which cannot be interpreted. However, NT-proBNP is not a neprilysin substrate, so its concentration remains independent of drug intake.",

    "question": "What happens to the levels of BNP or NT-proBNP in the body with increasing age?",
    "option_a": "They decrease significantly",
    "option_b": "They increase with age, especially in women",
    "option_c": "They remain stable and unaffected by age",
    "option_d": "They decrease with obesity, but increase with age in women"
