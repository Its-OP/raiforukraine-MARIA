Diagnostic features of encephalic death are based on:===\n\n*clinical criteria:\n**Total absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity;\n**Abolition of all brainstem reflexes;\n**Total absence of spontaneous ventilation verified by a hypercapnia test.\n*and paraclinical criteria:\n**2 null and reactive electroencephalograms for 30 minutes performed 4 hours apart;\n**or cerebral angiography showing cessation of encephalic circulation.\n\n<br />\n\n===B.    The donor with a stopped heart===\nFrench law authorises donation \"from a deceased person in persistent cardiac and respiratory arrest\". These are known as deceased donors after circulatory arrest (DDAC).\n\nA distinction is made between :\n\n*donors who have suffered an \"uncontrolled\" out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;\n*donors who have suffered circulatory arrest in intensive care following a decision to stop active treatment.\n\n\nOnce proof of death has been obtained by recording an electrocardiogram lasting 5 minutes without QRS complexes or with agonic complexes < 5 per minute, a death report is drawn up, enabling the National Refusal Register (RNR) to be queried immediately, which is compulsory before any organ retrieval procedure can begin.",
