It is also used to assess the benefit-risk balance of MAP treatment for the individuals concerned.\n\nIt includes, as a minimum, the following examinations, following a medical history to look for specific risk factors:\n\n*clinical examination of both members of the couple if necessary\n*examination of the cycle and ovarian status\n*uterine and/or uterotubal examination as appropriate\n*spermogram, spermocytogram, sperm culture and sperm survival migration test if appropriate\n*testicular ultrasound and even sperm excretory tract ultrasound if necessary, in the event of alterations in sperm parameters\n*health safety tests on both members of the couple or on the unmarried woman\n\nFor a detailed exploration of infertility, refer to the LISA sheet for item 38 (Couple's infertility, what to do at the first consultation).\n\nHealth security tests\" include HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis serologies for both members of the couple or the unmarried woman. For people vaccinated against hepatitis B, a serological check is not necessary if immunity is known and documented.\n\nThe ''sperm survival migration test'' is indicated prior to MPA, in order to choose the most appropriate MPA technique. This test selects the most mobile spermatozoa and induces sperm capacitation. The result is an estimated number of progressively mobile spermatozoa \"usable\" for MPA.\n\nA ''psycho-social assessment'', involving an interview with a psychologist, may be offered to all couples undergoing MAP. An interview with a psychiatrist or a psychologist attached to the team is recommended (and systematically offered) for couples or unmarried women having recourse to gamete or embryo donation.\n\nA ''pre-conceptional exploration'' to ensure that there are no major risk factors for pregnancy-related pathologies or obstetric contraindications must be carried out before any MPA technique is performed, such as rubella and toxoplasmosis serologies, a metabolic exploration if necessary, and a TSH assay.\n\n<br />",
