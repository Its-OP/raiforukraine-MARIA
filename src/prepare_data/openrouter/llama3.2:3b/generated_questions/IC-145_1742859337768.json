R<sub>0</sub> is the expected average number of new cases of a communicable disease directly generated by a contagious person in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection (without immunity).\n\n''Example: an R<sub>0</sub>>1 for COVID-19 indicates that the number of secondary cases is increasing. For influenza, R<sub>0</sub> \u2248 2, for measles, R<sub>0</sub> \u2248 16.''\n\n'''''Mortality''':''' ratio between the number of deaths in a given period (generally one year) and the total population (generally reported per 100,000 people).\n\n'''''Lethality:''''' ratio between the number of deaths in a given period and the population affected by the condition in question.\n\n''Example: over the last 10 years, there have been 50 to 60 deaths each year linked to invasive meningococcal infections in France, for a number of cases \u2248 500/year, giving a mortality rate of 0.1/100,000 (overall population) and a case-fatality rate of 10-12% (among cases)''.",
