It is the history, the circumstances of the onset, the sudden onset or otherwise of the symptoms, the cardiac examination and the comparative examination of the lower limbs that enable the mechanism of the obstruction to be suspected as a matter of urgency. There are usually 2 main types of obstruction, although they may be interrelated:\n\n*embolism: very abrupt onset, rapidly sensory-motor ischaemia and contralateral peripheral pulses present, no known arterial disease, cardiac arrhythmia discovered;\n*thrombosis: more gradual onset, less severe ischaemia, history of lower limb arterial disease, sinus rhythm.\n[File:Arterio.jpg|vignette]]\nIn the event of embolism, it is important to look for involvement of another arterial territory (particularly mesenteric). In all cases, the patient must be treated in a specialist hospital.",
