In situ\" cancers (ductal or lobular) are therefore characterised by their lack of metastatic potential.\n* When the carcinoma becomes invasive (= crosses the basement membrane), the cells can spread either by lymphatic or haematogenous route or by contiguity.\n* Lymphatic drainage of the breast takes place at three main sites: the lymph nodes of the axillary fossa (the most important), the supra- and sub-clavicular nodes and the nodes of the internal mammary chain. These different areas can therefore be affected by the disease.",
