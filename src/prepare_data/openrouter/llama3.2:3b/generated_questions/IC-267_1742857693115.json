It is essential to assess the degree of severity in order to decide on symptomatic treatment. If there are conduction problems or neuromuscular signs, treatment must be given as a matter of extreme urgency.\n*Severe hyperkalaemia (kalaemia > 7 mmol/L) or an electrocardiographic threat is an absolute emergency:\n**Hyperkalaemic drugs must be stopped.\n**Membrane antagonist limiting hypoexcitability induced by hyperkalaemia:\n***IV calcium salts (10 to 30 ml), except if digitalis is present (in which case use a magnesium salt).\n**Transfer of K to the intracellular compartment:\n***insulin-glucose (e.g. 500 ml G10% + 10-15 U rapid insulin over 30 minutes)",
