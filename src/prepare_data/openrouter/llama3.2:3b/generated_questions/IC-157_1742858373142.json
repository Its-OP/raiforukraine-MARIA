EXCEPT if endocarditis is suspected = spread over the first 24 hours.\n\n*In children, if venipuncture is difficult (this is often the case in infants), it is preferable to fill a single blood culture bottle with a large quantity of blood rather than multiplying the bottles with a small quantity of blood.\n*Samples should be taken before any antibiotic therapy, except in cases of purpura fulminans.\n\n\n'''<u>Analysis of blood cultures in the laboratory</u>:'''\n\n*After transfer to the microbiology laboratory, the vials are introduced into the automated system for monitoring (detection of bacterial/fungal growth).\n*''If''' culture positive (within 24-48 hours for most bacteria) = direct examination (Gram stain) '''AND''' Clinician informed\n*Then carry out the antibiotic susceptibility test (requires a further 24 hours)\n*Inform the microbiologist of suspected endocarditis: incubation period 10 to 14 days\n*Inform the microbiologist/mycologist of immunosuppressive factors requiring cryptococcosis testing (incubation period 3 to 4 weeks).\n*Fungal blood cultures: positive in 1 to 5 days (confirmation of the presence of yeasts or filaments by MGG or Giemsa staining). Immediate communication to the clinician to start probabilistic antifungal treatment.\n*Fungal subcultures for identification and antifungal gram: minimum delay 3 days.\n*Techniques for more rapid identification of the microorganism exist (PCR, mass spectrometry) but are not available in all laboratories.\n\n'''<u>Interpretation of a positive fungal blood culture</u>''''\n\n* Any flask positive for \"Candida\" spp or \"Cryptococcus neoformans\" should be taken into consideration and treated.\n* The detection of rare yeasts should be discussed with the mycologist.\n* Malassezia yeasts are responsible for fungemia in neonatology.\n\n'''<u>[[Positive blood culture SD-190|Interpretation of blood cultures]]</u> : Contamination during puncture or \"true\" bacteremia?''''\n\n'''Take into account the number of positive vials and the microbial species'''\n\n*Infectious agents that are ''always pathogenic'' (= always a ''true'' bacteremia): Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pyogenic streptococci, Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria, Brucella, Pasteurella and Candida.\n*Are possible ''contaminants'' (because they belong to the skin flora):\n**coagulase-negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp.\n**In order to conclude that bacteremia has been caused by these bacteria, the following is required:\n***A compatible context (catheter or endovascular equipment in place)\n***+ At least 2 positive blood culture bottles from 2 different pairs with the same bacterial species presenting the same antibiotic sensitivity phenotype (same antibiogram).",
