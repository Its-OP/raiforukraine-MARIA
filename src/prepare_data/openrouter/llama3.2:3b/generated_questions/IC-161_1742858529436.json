The introduction of such treatment should prompt the patient to seek the advice of a referral centre''.\n*Treatment is largely guided by questioning, which often enables risk factors specific to each patient to be identified.\n\n==Hygienic and dietary measures should be proposed, but:==\n\n*Only increasing oral hydration has been formally proven to be effective.\n*Post-coital micturition and micturition not retained seem interesting; but it is above all the \"micturition catalogue\" which will provide information on the \"errors\" made by the patient.\n*Constipation in children and adults|regularisation of transit 283]], wearing cotton underwear, wiping from front to back... are all measures, sometimes restrictive for some patients, which have not yet been proven to be effective in the scientific literature.\n\n==The risk factors identified in the literature are:==\n\n*Frequency of intercourse (OR = 5.8)\n*1<sup>first</sup> cystitis under the age of 15 (OR=3.9)\n*new partner (OR=1.9)\n*spermicide (OR=1.8); the only truly modifiable factor\n\n==Non-antibiotic treatments that have been shown to be effective are:==\n\n*cranberry, but low level of evidence. Only oral supplements with a minimum dose of 36 mg/day of type A proanthocyanidin appear to be effective (no benefit from cranberry juice or derivatives).\n*Immunoactive prophylaxis = vaccine (not available in France), which has been shown to be effective in studies with a high level of evidence.\n*Local oestrogen therapy has also been shown to be effective, but in more specific populations, particularly post-menopausal women.\n\n==If these measures fail and there is more than 1 episode per month, long-term antibiotic prophylaxis may be offered as follows:==\n\n*Continuous trimethoprim\n*or Fosfomycin-tetamol, one sachet per week\n*or taken only in the pericoital period when sexual intercourse is the triggering factor (without exceeding the usual doses = not taken with each act of intercourse if there is a lot of sexual activity).\n*The need for long-term antibiotic prophylaxis should be regularly reassessed.\n\n<br />",
