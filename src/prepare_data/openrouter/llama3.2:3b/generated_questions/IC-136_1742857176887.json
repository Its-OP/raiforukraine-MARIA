In order to ensure the safety of this care, the selection criteria used to validate outpatient care must be assessed prior to surgery (\"''[[Information and monitoring of a patient undergoing outpatient surgery SD-356|information and monitoring of a patient undergoing outpatient surgery]'').\n\nAmbulatory surgery is part of the more global concept of early rehabilitation after surgery (RAC), which is a comprehensive approach to patient care that ''promotes early recovery of the patient's abilities after surgery''. The key points of an EPR are :\n\n* informing patients and training them in the process\n* anticipate the organisation of care and the patient's discharge\n* reduce the consequences of surgical stress\n* controlling pain in all situations\n* encouraging and stimulating patient autonomy",
