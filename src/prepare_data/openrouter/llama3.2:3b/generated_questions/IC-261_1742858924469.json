Elementary glomerular lesions\n\n* Three techniques are used to study the glomerulus:\n** light microscopy using PAS, trichrome and silver staining ;\n** immunofluorescence examination using antibodies directed against IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, light chains of kappa and lambda immunoglobulins, and fibrin;\n** electron microscopy.\n\n* 4 elementary glomerular lesions are usually described.\n** Cell proliferation: table 3.\n** Sclerosis (or fibrosis): fibrous scarring replacing the whole of the destroyed glomerulus (sclerotic glomerulus) or part of the destroyed glomerulus (segmental sclerosis).\n** Deposits of immunoglobulin chains (IgG, IgM, IgA, Kappa, Lambda) or complement. Table 4 summarises the different locations.\n** Other deposits\n*** hyaline deposits (segmental and focal hyalinosis) ;\n*** amyloid deposits (Ig chains: AL amyloidosis, SAA: AA amyloidosis);\n*** deposits of glycosylated proteins and extracellular matrix (diabetes).\n\n\nTable 3: Cell proliferation\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Name\n|Cell type\n|Clinical translation\n|-\n|Mesangial proliferation\n|Mesangial cells\n|Inconsistent severity, observed in many pathologies\n|-\n|Endocapillary proliferation\n|Endothelial cells and infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes\n|Severity during acute inflammatory attacks (e.g. GNA) with inconstant renal failure.\n|-\n|Extracapillary proliferation\n|Parietal epithelial cells\n|High severity, acute renal failure, e.g. in rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis.\n|}\n\n\nTable 4: Glomerular locations of deposits\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Name\n|Location of deposits\n|-\n|Mesangial\n|Within the mesangium\n|-\n|Edomembranous\n|Subendothelial space (inner side of MBG)\n|-\n|Intramembranous\n|In the MBG\n|-\n|Extramembranous\n|In contact with the podocytes (outer side of the MBG)\n|}\nMBG: glomerular basement membrane\n<br />",
