Retrospective analysis of files is a time-consuming and labour-intensive system unless a computer search using a predefined programme searching for key words is organised.\n\nSerious adverse events are analysed either with :\n\n- a neutral external viewpoint, provided by the risk management unit ;\n- A positive error culture is part of the patient safety culture. It is based on not blaming the person who made the mistake. The natural tendency is to consider that the person responsible is the last in the chain of people involved in a care process. However, most of the time, the causes are multiple and often latent, undetectable at first glance.\n\nA non-blaming attitude, which must be shared by the head of the clinical department and hospital management, encourages the reporting of errors, their analysis and the implementation of improvement measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors. The opposite attitude means that errors are hidden. Failure to analyse them in depth creates second victims. A second victim can be defined as: \"a carer who is involved in and traumatised by an unforeseen and unfavourable event for a patient and/or a medical error for which he or she often feels personally responsible, leading to a feeling of failure and calling into question his or her clinical experience and fundamental skills\". The consequences can be serious, even leading to suicide when the carer, the last link in the chain, is personally implicated.\n\nDrawing up and complying with operating rules is one of the conditions for confidence in the healthcare risk management system. These rules can be set out in a charter, which specifies that reporting an error will not be penalised. Important elements of this charter include the following details:\n\n- objectivity is the rule. Reporting is based on facts that are not interpreted;\n\n- anonymity and confidentiality will be respected in the analysis that follows the reporting of the error or adverse event;\n\n- To be effective, reporting must be exhaustive, identifying all the risks associated with hospital activity and preventing them from recurring.\n\nSerious adverse events occurring in hospitals are usually identified using passive systems based on :\n\n- voluntary reporting by doctors and other healthcare professionals, even though the 2009 \"Hospital, Patient, Health and Territory\" law makes it compulsory;\n\n- the desire of patients, their families or close friends to explain the problems they have encountered or to obtain compensation for the harm they feel they have suffered.\n\nThis information is sent to a risk management unit and to the healthcare risk management coordinator, a compulsory function in every health establishment.\n\nThe third major class of error detection involves active systems based on the analysis of files or electronic traces.
