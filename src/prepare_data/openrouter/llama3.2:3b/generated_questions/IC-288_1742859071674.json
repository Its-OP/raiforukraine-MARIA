This highlights the need for a detailed semiological approach and a good clinical examination.\n\nIn order to avoid being confused by a different symptomatology, the following summary table provides points of orientation in the event of acute pain.\n\n'''Table 1: etiological orientation according to anal pain'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|What type?\n|What rhythm?\n|How long does it last?\n|But also ....\n|So I mention\n|-\n|Cooking\n|The saddle\n|One to two days\n|Prostatic edema and bleeding\n|Haemorrhoidal crisis\n|-\n|Intense pain\n|Touching/support\n|A few hours to a few days\n|Painful anal tumefaction, well-limited\n|External haemorrhoidal thrombosis\n|-\n|Burning\n|Bowel movement and long afterwards (hours)\n|Periods of several weeks\n|Bleeding\n|Anal fissure\n|-\n|Tension\n|Touch/support\n|Several hours and continuous, inflammatory\n|Painful swelling, poorly limited; dysuria\n|Abscess\n|-\n|Fingerprints\n|Before bowel movements\n|Several days\n|Seizures\n|Fecalome/\n\ncancer\n|}\n<br />",
