It is useful to carry out a biological work-up in patients presenting with IBS. The aim is to rule out an organic pathology. A CBC will rule out anaemia, and a CRP will look for an inflammatory syndrome.  In diarrhoea-predominant IBS, it is also advisable to measure TSH to rule out hyperthyroidism and IgA-type anti-transglutaminase antibodies to look for coeliac disease. A parasitological examination of the stools is recommended in the diarrhoeal subtype to rule out lambliasis. Radiological examinations have no place in typical forms of IBS.\n\n<br />",
