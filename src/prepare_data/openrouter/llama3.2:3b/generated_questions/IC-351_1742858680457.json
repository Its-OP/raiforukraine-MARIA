Onset is generally abrupt and the course fluctuates. Main aetiologies: non-psychiatric pathologies, intoxication or withdrawal of a psychoactive substance, iatrogeny.\n* Severe dehydration (hydro-electrolytic disorders)\n* Sepsis: cardiovascular shock, acute respiratory distress, cyanosis.\n\n=== Non-psychiatric signs ===\n\n* Neurological examination: miosis, mydriasis, meningeal syndrome, focal signs, tongue biting, etc.\n* General examination to look for a metabolic, hydro-electrolytic or endocrine aetiology: dehydration, tachycardia, urinary globe, etc.\n* General examination to look for an infectious aetiology: hyperthermia, meningeal syndrome, dyspnoea, cyanosis, sweating, etc.\n\n=== Psychiatric signs ===\n\n* Depressive and manic symptoms\n* Psychotic symptoms\n* Anxiety symptoms\n\n== Paraclinical examinations\nA minimum blood test is systematically carried out; it will be combined with additional tests depending on the anamnesis and the points raised during questioning and clinical examination (see corresponding knowledge objective).\n<br />",
