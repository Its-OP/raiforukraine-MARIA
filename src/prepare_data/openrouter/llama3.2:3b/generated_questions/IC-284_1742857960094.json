The prevalence varies from country to country and according to the diagnostic criteria used. It is more prevalent in women than in men, and is more common in young people. The impact on quality of life can be very significant. The impact of the disease on productivity at work has also been widely demonstrated. It is still a poorly recognised public health problem.",
