The term \"complex spinal pain\" is preferred.\n\nThe aetiologies of complex spinal pain are considered to be :\n\n- both causes and consequences of chronic low back pain, which can sometimes run up yellow flags,\n\n- which we try to prevent with appropriate, early treatment of low back pain,\n\n- which is what makes it so serious.\n\n\n\nETIOLOGIES OF COMPLEX SPINAL PAIN :\n\n\n1.     SOCIAL\n\n- Restrictions on professional participation: prolonged or repeated work stoppages, unfitness for the job, invalidity, job insecurity, burnout\n\n- Restrictions on social, family, cultural and sporting participation\n\n\n2.     PSYCHOLOGICAL\n\n- Anxiety, depression\n\n- Attitudes of fear and avoidance, kinesiophobia (fear of movement)\n\n- Misuse of analgesics\n\n\n3.     OVERALL PHYSICS\n\n- Deconditioning during exercise, weight gain\n\n- Sedentary lifestyle, physical inactivity\n\n- Sleep disorders\n\n- Side effects of analgesics or NSAIDs (e.g. drowsiness)\n\n\n4.     RACHIDIENNES\n\n- Intense and/or persistent pain, analgesic attitude\n\n- Segmental and/or global stiffening of the spine\n\n- Loss of endurance and strength in the abdominal and spinal muscles\n\n- Persistent functional disability\n<br />",
