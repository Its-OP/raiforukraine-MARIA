Right pleural fluid effusion of great abundance on a radiograph taken in bed in the supine position.\n</gallery>\n\n\nPleural ultrasound :\n\n*Hypoechoic, sloping line separating the lung wall.\n*Anechoic fluid may be an exudate or transudate.\n*An echogenic or partitioned fluid is an exudate.\n \nChest scan\n\n*Crescent-shaped image, concave towards the lung and therefore posterior (Figure 6).\n*Haemothorax'': on a CT scan without injection, the density of the blood (around 60 HU) is greater than that of the pleural fluid (0-20 HU) (Figure 7).\n*Empyema'': pleural effusion containing purulent fluid. The two layers of the pleura are thickened to form a biconvex pleural collection, the walls of which are enhanced after injection, sometimes with air bubbles or partitions within the collection (Figure 8).\n*Hydropneumothorax'': mixed pleural effusion, liquid and air. It is seen on X-ray and CT scan by the presence of a hydro-aerosic level within the pleural cavity (Figure 9).\n*Empyema can progress to \"pachypleuritis\" (or fibrothorax) in the form of pleural thickening, often calcified pleural layers, which can cause restrictive respiratory failure (Figure 10).\n*'''A malignant tumour pleura''' will most often manifest as pleural thickening of more than one centimetre, with a frequently circumferential and/or nodular involvement (Figure 11)\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Plevre6.JPG|'''Figure 6.'''
