The examiner must be able to assess :\n\nLocomotion :\n\n- Lower limb movements, step size and speed\n\n- Upper limb movements (e.g. symmetrical swing)\n\n- Posture of the trunk, general gait when walking\n\n- Occurrence of problems in particular circumstances (transfers, turning around, going up and down stairs, walking in tandem or with eyes closed).\n\nPosture:\n\nIt can be normal or inclined forwards, backwards or sideways.\n\nBalance:\n\nIt is tested with the eyes open and then closed, in bipodal support with the feet together or apart, in monopodal support, during manoeuvres of resistance to retro- or antepulsion.\n\nNeurological examination\n\nIt must include a search for a motor deficit, including a study of the osteotendinous and plantar cutaneous reflexes, a search for amyotrophy, a search for a sensory deficit, a cerebellar syndrome, a peripheral or central vestibular syndrome, a Parkinsonian syndrome or movement disorders, vesico-sphincter disorders and cognitive disorders.\n\n'''- The general examination'''\n\nDermatological examination: looking for scars from trauma or osteoarticular, neurosurgical or vascular surgery, looking for skin trophic disorders.\n\nOsteoarticular examination: looking for pain, mobility limitations\u0301 or joint deformities.\n\nCardiovascular examination: looking for orthostatic arterial hypotension, cardiac rhythm or conduction disorders, arterial disease.\n\nOphthalmological examination: looking for a drop in visual acuity\u0301.",
