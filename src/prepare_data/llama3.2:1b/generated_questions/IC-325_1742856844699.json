In the case of ''no-fault'' liability, the victim will be compensated by the Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents M\u00e9dicaux, des Affections Iatrog\u00e8nes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) on the basis of ''national solidarity''.\n\nThe ONIAM's mission is therefore to organise a system of \"out-of-court\", rapid and free compensation for victims of medical accidents, whether at fault (in the event of insurance failure) or not, \"without going to court\".",
