It modifies the radial folds of the anus and is often fairly localised. The swelling is indurated on palpation and is often very tender. It does not require anoscopy for diagnosis (this examination is often painful in the acute phase of thrombosis and should be avoided). Haemorrhoidal attacks are associated, to varying degrees, with a sensation of cooking, tension or sharp pain in the anus, and late and infrequent bleeding.",
