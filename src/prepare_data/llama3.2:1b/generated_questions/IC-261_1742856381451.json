Relapse after discontinuation of treatment in 50% of cases, necessitating resumption of corticosteroid therapy.\n* Corticodependence: relapse after corticosensitivity occurring when corticosteroid therapy is reduced or rapidly after it is stopped. Often requires the addition of an immunosuppressant or immunomodulator.\n* Corticoresistance: non-response (10% of cases), risk (50%) of end-stage chronic renal failure within 5 years.\n\n<br />",

    "question": "What is the main difference between corticosteroid-sensitive, corticosteroid-resistant, and corticosteroid-dependent NS?",
    "option_a": "Corticosteroid-sensitive NS is characterized by the presence of proteinuria and the need for corticosteroid therapy to control proteinuria.",
    "option_b": "Corticosteroid-resistant NS is characterized by the absence of proteinuria and the need for corticosteroid therapy to control proteinuria.",
    "option_c": "Corticosteroid-dependent NS is characterized by the presence of proteinuria and the need for corticosteroid therapy to control proteinuria, but with a higher risk of end-stage chronic renal failure.",
    "option_d": "Corticosteroid-sensitive NS is characterized by the absence of proteinuria and the need for corticosteroid therapy to control proteinuria, but with a lower risk of end-stage chronic renal failure.",
