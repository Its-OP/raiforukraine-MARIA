In France today, ''10% of children are asthmatic''. This risk increases when one of the two parents is asthmatic (25% of asthmatic children in this case), and to more than 50% if both parents are asthmatic.\n\n\nThe ''main triggers'' in childhood asthma are primarily\n\n- viral infections\n\n- allergy to pneumallergens (the same as in adults)\n\n\nThere are other ''clearly identified factors'' that trigger asthma in children:\n\n- exposure to tobacco from conception\n\n- indoor air pollution and atmospheric pollution\n\n\nAlterations to the microbiota of newborn babies could increase the risk of developing allergic pathologies.",
