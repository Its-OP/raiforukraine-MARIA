The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders and cognitive disorders.\n\n'''The different origins of gait disorders:'''\n\n- Walking disorders of ''painful'' origin. The disorder observed is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific (exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease: muscular glycogenosis).\n\n- Walking disorders of ''ataxic'' origin. (i) cerebellar ataxia (static, kinetic and locomotor cerebellar syndrome), (ii) vestibular ataxia (vertigo, gait deviation, manoeuvres), (iii) proprioceptive ataxia (heeling gait, hypopallesthesia).\n\n- Gait disorders of \"central\" origin. Central motor deficit disorder: sequelae of a cerebrovascular accident, essentially in the form of hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.\n\n- Peripheral gait disorders. Motor disorders of peripheral origin: often predominant in the extremities (steppage), or muscular disorders whose deficient topography is often symmetrical and predominantly proximal, giving a waddling gait.\n\n- Gait disorder with ''gait with small steps''. Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.\n\n'''Other walking disorders:''''\n\n- Dystonia: (hyperkinetic motor disorder) pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, \"heron\" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, \"dromedary gait\" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.\n\n- Chorea: (hyperkinetic motor disorder)\n\n- Tremor (primary orthostatic tremor)\n\n- Trendelenburg lameness (instability with lowering of the pelvis on the non-weight-bearing side)",
