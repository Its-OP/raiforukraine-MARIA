In fact, all these elements can be a source of leucocyturia outside of any infectious process:\n**Recent urinary tract manipulation\n**Presence of endo-urinary material\n**Presence of a foreign body (stone, tumour)\n\n*The accepted threshold for significant leucocyturia is \u2265 10<sup>4</sup> /mL.\n*The threshold for significant bacteriuria in men is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL\n*The threshold for significant bacteriuria in women is set at 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL except for E. coli and S. saprophyticus, for which the threshold is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL.\n\n*Whatever the case, the clinical situation always takes precedence over these different thresholds and the diagnosis of UTI should not be ruled out<s>e</s> if the clinical situation is obvious.\n*Genuine UTIs have negative leucocyturia (immunodepression, etc).\n\n*On the other hand, bacteriuria with leucocyturia in the absence of symptoms should not lead to treatment because it is a case of urinary colonisation.\n*Finally, remember that the ECBU is not an infallible test and that in 10 to 15% of cases, it proves negative even though the infection is clinically proven (bacteria \"decapitated\" by antibiotic therapy, ECBU performed incorrectly, etc.).",
