It is generally pain induced by care (such as the re-dressing of dressings, sutures, vascular punctures, mobilisation in intensive care, etc.) or by a diagnostic examination (such as a biopsy), sometimes referred to as procedural pain. Procedural pain must be anticipated and prevented by appropriate means, which often requires a multimodal approach (systemic medication, local or loco-regional anaesthesia, anxiety management, complementary techniques such as hypnosis, neurostimulation, etc.).",
