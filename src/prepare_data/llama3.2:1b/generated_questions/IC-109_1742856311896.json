A third party's opinion is sometimes necessary, as some complaints are better perceived by those around the patient than by the patient (slowing down, loss of arm swing).\n\n- The severity of the disorder must be assessed in everyday life: ''falls or near-falls'', their consequences in terms of morbidity'' (trauma, fractures, hospitalisation) or in terms of independence (unaccompanied outings from home with or without using public transport, accompanied outings, no outings from home).\n\n- Subjects' ability to climb (strength) or descend stairs (balance), their walking perimeter, their independence for activities (housework, cooking) and daily activities (dressing and grooming in particular), the use of a cane, wheelchair or walker, the need for human assistance, etc.\n\n- The full list of medications taken, which should also be known (''the leading risk factor for falls in the elderly'').\n\n- '''Cognitive abilities''' of the subject",
