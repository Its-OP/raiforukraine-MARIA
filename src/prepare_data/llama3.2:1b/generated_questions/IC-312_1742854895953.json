The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.\n*HBOC accounts for around 20% of familial breast cancers, but less than 5% of all breast cancers. When questioned, it is important to look for a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and, if necessary, to draw up a family tree.\n*The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for proteins that play major roles in DNA repair and act as tumour suppressors. If these proteins are defective, DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired and contribute to carcinogenesis.\n*A patient with a \"BRCA1/2\" mutation should undergo either specific annual surveillance, including breast MRI, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Prophylactic bilateral adnexectomy is systematically recommended (between the ages of 40 and 45).\n\n<br />\n\n*Several cases of cancer in the same person or in the family may point to another genetic predisposition syndrome: \"PALB2\" mutation, Li Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene coding for the p53 protein).\n\n<br />",
