This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e. it tends to bias the results of the study in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference.\n* or ''differential'', i.e. the risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference, or in favour of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.  \n\n'''Selection bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomisation prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimise these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.  \n\n'''Classification bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the classification error on the judgement criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgement criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words bring the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgement criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgement criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls. Generally speaking, these biases can be limited by using data collection procedures that are as standardised and objective as possible, and that are similar for all subjects included in the study.",
