Atelectasis can also be passive (pulmonary collapse on contact with a pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome, for example) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).\n\nAtelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by ''a direct sign and indirect signs''.\n\n#Direct sign'': opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity has the following characteristics\n#*Systematised with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.\n#*No aeriform bronchogram.\n#Indirect signs: corresponding to the consequences of the reduction in volume of the affected area.\n#*Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma\n#*Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart and hilum\n#*Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome\n#*Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories\n\nChest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to \"specify the site of the obstruction\" (endoluminal, wall or extrinsic) \"and its nature\" (foreign body, tumour, etc.).\n\n\n'''Example of parenchymal atelectasis on chest X-ray (Figures 1-3):'''\n\n(NB: TDM images are provided for illustrative purposes)<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Atel1.JPG|'''Figure 1'''.

Systematised homogeneous opacity of the right upper lobe with displacement of the small scissure, ascending. The scissure has a concave edge towards the healthy lung in its lateral portion (black arrow), and a more convex edge above the right lobe (white arrow). This is atelectasis of the right upper lobe, secondary to the presence of a suprahelical mass. The suprahilar mass is responsible for the convex medial contour of the atelectasis. B. Illustration on the same radiograph of both the concave and convex appearance of the scissure, a consequence of the presence of a tumour mass (in blue): this is Golden's \"S\" sign (in black).\n</gallery>",
