Minimal glomerular nephrotic syndrome (MGNS)\n\n'''Diagnosis:'''\n\n* the main signs are :\n** sudden onset,\n** usually pure nephrotic syndrome\n** frequent abdominal pain in children,\n** complications of nephrotic syndrome: thrombosis, infections.\n\n* However, in children, renal biopsy is not performed if :\n** pure nephrotic syndrome,\n** age between 1 and 10 years,\n** corticosensitive nephrotic syndrome,\n** no family history of nephropathy,\n** no extrarenal signs,\n** normal serum complement.\n\n* Renal biopsy shows optically normal glomeruli, with no deposits'''''''''''. Electron microscopy shows fusion of the feet of the podocytes.\n* A cause should be sought (secondary SNLGM): NSAIDs, interferon treatment, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n* In the absence of a cause, SNLGM (like primary segmental and focal hyalinosis) belongs to an entity known as idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.",
