It usually develops in winter flare-ups, but can develop continuously (severe form). Improvement or even \"cure\" occurs in childhood, but 3 to 5% of children progress to an adult form, particularly those with a severe form.\n[File:Fig 1 l\u00e9sions v\u00e9siculeuses.jpg|vignette|DA aigue]]\nIt should be noted that a late onset in adulthood is possible but rare. It is a diagnosis of elimination which should lead to a search for other pathologies, in particular: scabies, contact eczema, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, etc.",
