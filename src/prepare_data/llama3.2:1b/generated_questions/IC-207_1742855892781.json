On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard x-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures (Figure 1). Any displaced rib fracture should be scanned for pneumothorax, haemothorax or laceration of the lung parenchyma.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:3.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. A. Chest X-ray in a polytrauma patient showing several displaced right rib fractures (arrows) that are difficult to see. B. CT scan section in the same patient showing a minimally displaced anterior arch fracture of the 4<sup>th</sup> right rib (white arrows) and a displaced posterior arch fracture of the 5<sup>th</sup> right side (black arrow). Note the homolateral posterior haemothorax and anterior pneumothorax.\n</gallery>A costal flap is defined by the presence of two fracture sites involving at least three successive ribs (Figure 2). On clinical examination, a paradoxical movement of the hemithorax is observed. A rib flap is a serious injury often requiring intensive care and sometimes surgical treatment.\n\nDamage to the first three ribs is a marker of high-energy trauma, and may be associated with vascular or nerve damage (brachial plexus). Involvement of the 8th to 11th costal arches should prompt a search for an upper abdominal injury (hepatic or splenic).<gallery widths=\"900\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:4.jpg|'''Figure 2'''.
