It is expressed as a unitless percentage.\n\n'''Prevalence''': proportion of the number of cases of a disease (however old it may be) in a population at a given time, or rather generally over a given period (e.g. over the course of a year).\n\n'''Incidence rate''': number of new cases during a given period, within a population, divided by the sum of person-time (follow-up time for each individual in the population likely to fall ill during the period observed, with follow-up being counted until the onset of the disease, the end of the observation period, death or loss of sight).\n\nEstimates of these parameters from a sample must be accompanied by their ''confidence interval''.",
