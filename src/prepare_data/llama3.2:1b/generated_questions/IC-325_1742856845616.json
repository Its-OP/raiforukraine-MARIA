The same definition was extended to counterfeit HEALTH PRODUCTS by the International Medicines Products AntiCounterfeitingTask force (IMPACT) in 2008.\n\nNot to be confused with :\n\n    - patent infringement or patent litigation\n\n    - Unregistered products: medical products (generics or specialities) that are not authorised for sale in a given country but are authorised for sale elsewhere.\n\n    - Unintentionally inferior products: batches that do not meet standards, quality defects or failure to comply with good manufacturing or distribution practices.\n\nFake medicines\" have a broader definition to extend the scope of the WHO's fight against counterfeit medicines:\n\n- counterfeit medicines: the concept of intellectual property protection varies greatly from country to country\n\n- patent infringement: requires chemical analysis of the product\n\n- trademark infringement: e.g. imitation packaging\n\nThe term \"counterfeiting\", which is ambiguous, is therefore being abandoned.\n\nSeveral texts have been adopted to strengthen this fight, including the Council of Europe Convention on counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes threatening public health (known as Medicrime).",
