It can be discrete (e.g. gender) or continuous (e.g. blood glucose level).\n\nThe ''probability law'' describes the probability associated with each value of a discrete random variable, or the probability associated with any interval of values of a continuous random variable.\n\nBy observing the outcomes of a random variable over sufficiently large series (for example, a large number of individuals), it is possible to determine their frequencies and then estimate the probability law governing the variable.\n\n<br />",
