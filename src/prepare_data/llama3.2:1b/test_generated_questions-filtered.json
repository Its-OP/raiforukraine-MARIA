For a long time, death was recognised through the inanimate or cold corpse. Then came the notion of death due to cardiac arrest and then encephalic death.\n\nIn 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined this new definition of death as encephalic death, but it was not officially recognised until 1968 in the circular legalising the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the so-called Jeanneney circular).\n\nIt can therefore be said that today there are two ways of being dead, as stated in \"Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes and amending the Public Health Code\".)\n\n# Patient in cardiac arrest (clinical criteria) :\n#* Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation;\n#* Abolition of all brain stem reflexes;\n#* Absence of spontaneous ventilation;\n#* In this case samples must be taken rapidly.\n# Patient in a state of encephalic death:\n#* No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test;\n#* Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation;\n#* In these cases, sampling may be deferred and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state in order to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.\n\nIn this context, it is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:\n\n* people in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I);\n* people in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II);\n* people for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment because of the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III);\n* people who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).\n\nEncephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. In addition, the general public fears that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. So we need to be very clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. We need to listen, explain and support them. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels on this subject: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.\n\n\n'''A special case: organ donation and the medico-legal obstacle'''\n\n* If there is a \"medico-legal obstacle\" at the time of death... this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.\n* BUT :\n** Agreement of the Public Prosecutor+++ (role of the forensic pathologist+++) / The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.\n** The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.\n** The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",

In this case, it reflects a failure to resorb the liquid secreted by the vagina (known as a non-communicating hydrocele).

In this situation, the differential diagnosis of strangulated hernia or torsion of the spermatic cord may be raised.\n*In adults, it is common and is due to a defect in the resorption of fluid secreted by the vagina (non-communicating).\n*The clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a non-painful swelling suspended above and independent of the testicle.\n*Hydrocele or cord cyst are not emergencies.\n\n<br />",

On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard x-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures (Figure 1).

DCs are classified according to their potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak activity) and their galenic form (cream, ointment, lotion and gel).\n\n\n'''The choice of a DC depends on four criteria: age, location of lesions, extent to be treated and oozing nature of lesions.'''\n\n\n<u>choice of galenical</u>:\n\n-ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas\n\n-cream for oozing areas, folds and large skin surfaces\n\n-lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children)\n\n- scalp gel (rarely used in children)\n\n<u>The choice of activity level</u>\n\n-Very strong DCs are contraindicated on infants and young children, and on the face, folds and seat.\n\nHigh-activity CDs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated in children on lichenified lesions, on the extremities and on lesions resistant to moderate-activity CDs.      \n\nModerate-activity CDs are used on the face and body of infants and children.\n\nlow-activity CDs are of no interest because they have little or no efficacy.\n\nnumber of applications per day\n\nA single application per day is just as effective as several applications, and makes it easier to adhere to treatment.  \n\n<u>quantity to be applied</u>\n\nThere is no maximum quantity recommended during the initial treatment.\n\nThe amount required to maintain remission during maintenance treatment should not normally exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity CD for children and 60 g/month of high-activity CD for adults.\n\nDuring the maintenance period, it has been shown in children and adults that the systematic use of a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on the skin areas usually affected for 4 months reduced the number of flare-ups without side-effects. This method of using DCs (pro-active treatment) is particularly suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups that recur rapidly when DCs are stopped.\n<br />\n\n=== 3) Emollients ===\nEmollients improve the functional signs of skin dryness and some of them temporarily restore the skin's barrier function.\n\nThe use of emollients is recommended by professional agreement from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as a maintenance treatment throughout the duration of AD, regardless of its severity.\n\nprecautions for use:\n\ninterruption for a few days during a highly inflammatory flare-up (frequently poor tolerance)\n\n-Galenics to be adapted to the patient's preferences\n\nFragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitisation. ATTENTION: emollients are not reimbursed by the health insurance scheme, with the exception of atopiclair®, generics of dexeryl© (reimbursable at 15%) and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.\n<br />\n\n=== 4) Therapeutic education ===\nThe aim of therapeutic education is to teach patients how to live optimally with a chronic disease. It is a process integrated into care, adapted to the patient's needs, which includes a range of information and learning techniques provided by one or more carers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, .....) during programmes involving consultation(s) and/or meetings in small groups. The aim is to help patients and/or their families become more independent, to encourage them to adhere to treatment and to combat corticophobia, which is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\nOther treatments :\n\noral antihistamines (anti-H1): no proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase apart from an old study / interest in hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during the flare-up period in young children with sleep disorders\n\n\n-Topical immunomodulator: tacrolimus (in France) - indicated for flare-ups of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (facial lesions++).\n\n\n-Systemic treatments: treatment of severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated (risk of rebound on discontinuation).  ",

The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:\n\n*embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.\n*thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n*coagulation disorders.\n\nAetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, ''as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit''. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.\n\nThe \"treatment\" is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:\n\n*In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.\n*Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox®, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.\n*long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g. atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).\n\n== Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) ==\nCRVO is characterised by the following:\n[[File:OVCR.jpg|vignette]]\n\n*Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.\n*On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.\n*Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form;\n*Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.\n\nIn patients aged over 50, the ''etiological work-up'' is therefore usually as simple as possible:\n\n*to look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia;\n*as well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.\n\nIn cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).\n\nNon-ischaemic forms\" in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:\n\n*either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases);\n*the persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.\n\nIschaemic forms'', either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.\n\nThe development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to \"neovascular glaucoma\" (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).\n\nThe aim of ''treating'' a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.\n\nNo medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.\n\nTreatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox®) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.\n\n<br />",

It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.\n\nThe aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:1.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray. A-B. Solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura. C-D. Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes. E-F. Aneurysm of the aortic arch. G-H. Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos.\n</gallery><br />Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths=\"800\" heights=\"600\">\nFile:2.jpg|'''Figure 2''. A-B.

Examination of ocular motility in different gaze positions'': this examination is used to observe the six oculomotor muscles of each eye separately (ductions) and in combination (versions).\n\n'''3. Cover-test:''' this test consists of asking the subject to stare at a point situated straight ahead in the distance. One eye is masked by a cover and then the cover is moved to the opposite eye. In subjects with normal oculomotor parallelism, no movement is observed. In the case of paralytic strabismus, a restitution movement is observed.\n\n'''4. Red lens examination:''' this examination consists of placing a red lens in front of one eye (conventionally in front of the right eye) while the subject stares, with his uncovered left eye, at a white spot of light in front of him. Normally, the two images are confused in all gaze positions and the patient sees only one point of light. In the case of an oculomotor imbalance, the two points are separated: the patient sees a red point and a white point, and the shift can be analysed to identify the muscle in deficit.\n\n'''5. Hess-Lancaster or Lancaster test'': this test is used to diagnose oculomotor paralysis, to determine the side of the paralysis and to identify the paralysed muscle or muscles. It is also an examination that allows the evolution of the paralysis to be followed by successive readings. A different coloured glass is placed in front of each of the patient's eyes, a red glass in one eye and a green glass in the other. The patient is asked to move a luminous arrow, seen in red, on a screen and superimpose it on a luminous arrow, seen in green, moved by the examiner. The result is a graphical record of oculomotricity in the different gaze positions.\n\n'''6. Investigation of intrinsic motricity:''' inspection should look for pupillary inequality (= anisocoria).

The examination of the visual field (or perimetry) studies the sensitivity to light within this space by assessing the subject's perception of light tests of varying intensity and size. There are two main methods of examining the visual field: kinetic perimetry and static perimetry. Kinetic perimetry is particularly suitable for exploring peripheral deficits, particularly hemianopsia and quadranopsia. It is the examination method of choice in neuro-ophthalmology. Static perimetry is mainly indicated for optic nerve pathology, and in particular for diagnosing and monitoring chronic glaucoma. In fact, the first alterations to the visual field are very localised and central.\n\n'''B- Colour vision:''' it is useful to carry out a colour vision assessment to look for dyschromatopsia in two circumstances: 1- to detect a congenital anomaly, such as daltonism. coloured charts are used (pseudo-isochromatic charts, the best known of which is the lshihara chart). 2- in the presence of an acquired ocular condition. The Farnsworth test is usually used, in which the patient is asked to classify coloured tablets. The study of colour vision thus helps in the diagnosis of certain retinal disorders and optic neuropathies. It is also an essential element in monitoring treatments likely to cause retinopathy (synthetic anti-malarials) or optic neuropathy caused by drugs (mainly anti-tuberculosis drugs: ethambutol and isoniazid).\n\n'''C- Fundus angiography:'''' This involves taking images of the fundus after intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye which, depending on the indications, is either fluorescein or indocyanine green. Fluorescein angiography thus provides a dynamic study of retinal vascularisation. Injection of indocyanine green is mainly used to visualise pathological choroidal vessels (vascularisation of a choroidal angioma, choroidal neovessels during age-related macular degeneration).\n\n'''D-''' '''Electrophysiological investigations:'''''\n\n'''1. electroretinogram (ERG):''' The ERG is the recording of the retinal action potential secondary to light stimulation of the retina using a corneal electrode. The ERG reflects a global response of the retina and is only altered in the case of ''extensive retinal lesions'', for example certain hereditary retinal dystrophies.\n\n'''2. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs):''' they represent action potentials arising in the occipital cortex following light stimulation of the retina: they therefore explore the optic pathways in their entirety, from the ganglion cell to the occipital cortex. They can be used to diagnose optic neuropathies, and are particularly useful in multiple sclerosis, where they can be altered in the absence of any clinically detectable optic neuropathy.\n\n'''3. The electro-oculogram (EOG):''' it measures the activity of the pigment epithelium.\n\n'''E-''' '''Ultrasound:''''' The main purpose of A-mode ultrasound is to assess the length of the eyeball; the main purpose of B-mode ultrasound is to detect any retinal detachment in the case of ocular media disorders, to search for and locate an intraocular foreign body or to help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.\n\n'''F-Optical coherence tomography (OCT):''' it is used to obtain high-precision slices of the retina. Its main application is the study of macular disorders: premacular membrane, macular hole, macular oedema (diabetes, AMD), visualisation and localisation of choroidal neovessels (AMD). This method is also used to screen for and monitor chronic glaucoma, as it can reveal the loss of optic fibres, the first sign of glaucoma.\n\n'''E- Complementary examinations of the anterior segment:''''\n\n*Corneal topography: This is used to gather information about the curvature or relief (elevation) of the cornea, by projecting and analysing the reflection of a light pattern illuminating or scanning the cornea. The images collected are analysed in the form of colour maps. It is prescribed for analysing astigmatism, particularly in the search for keratoconus.\n*Biometry: this is a combined measurement of the curvature of the cornea (or keratometry) and the anterior-posterior (axial) length of the eye. The measurement is carried out using an optical device. It is used to calculate implant power in cataract surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />",

The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumour pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, oesophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia).\n\n'''Identification of an abnormal mediastinal image'''\n\nReading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum), which involves analysing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density (Figure 1).<gallery widths=\"650\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediastpedia1.jpg|'''Figure 1.

The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, the infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy, or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or in the family.\n\nThe risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately :\n\n- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labour ;\n\n- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding the work ;\n\n- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions ;\n\n- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes.\n\nThe risk is therefore minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes, but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of cases of neonatal herpes are ultimately observed in this situation. This is because :\n\n- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes;\n\n- but 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently: genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognised.\n\nVHB\n\nOne per cent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:\n\n- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test);( if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended.\n\n- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies[VFC(2] .\n\n- In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated.\n\nTransmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.     \n\nSero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended and the neonatologist should be informed.\n\n'''HIV'''\n\nMother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.\n\nVertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:\n\n- pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the foetus via the placenta.\n\n- intrapartum (infection during childbirth)\n\n- post-partum (via breast-feeding). 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth.\n\nTransmission can be influenced by several factors:\n\n- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load and low CD4 lymphocyte levels;\n\n- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery and intra-uterine infection (chorioamniotitis);\n\n- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries ;\n\n- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection.\n\n'''VZV'''\n\nTransmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes you to the risk of\n\n- ''Embryofetopathy'': the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation: amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy.\n\n- Shingles'' in the 1<sup>rst</sup> year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and > 3 weeks of childbirth)\n\n- '''Varicella neonatorum''': for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. '''93. [[Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) SD-093|Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal)]]'''''\n\n- In the case of maternal varicella, there is still a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether or not the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated: stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium (loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule). PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol (an active metabolite of vitamin D) increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.\n*Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone.\n*Hypocalcaemia therefore results :\n**either an increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation),\n**or a reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption).",

It is cosmopolitan, but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebosis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebosis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues (by vegetative forms of \"Entamoeba histolytica histolytica\").\n\n'''<u>Cryptosporidiosis</u>''''\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhoea, and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.\n\n'''<u>Giardiasis</u>''''\n\nGiardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhoea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.\n\n'''<u>Toxoplasmosis</u>''''\n\nToxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat faeces, and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases, and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",

During the first phase of labour, uterine contractions lead to the cervix collapsing and dilating, and the visceral pain impulse is carried by non-myelinated C fibres.

The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders and cognitive disorders.\n\n'''The different origins of gait disorders:'''\n\n- Walking disorders of ''painful'' origin. The disorder observed is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific (exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease: muscular glycogenosis).\n\n- Walking disorders of ''ataxic'' origin. (i) cerebellar ataxia (static, kinetic and locomotor cerebellar syndrome), (ii) vestibular ataxia (vertigo, gait deviation, manoeuvres), (iii) proprioceptive ataxia (heeling gait, hypopallesthesia).\n\n- Gait disorders of \"central\" origin. Central motor deficit disorder: sequelae of a cerebrovascular accident, essentially in the form of hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.\n\n- Peripheral gait disorders. Motor disorders of peripheral origin: often predominant in the extremities (steppage), or muscular disorders whose deficient topography is often symmetrical and predominantly proximal, giving a waddling gait.\n\n- Gait disorder with ''gait with small steps''. Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.\n\n'''Other walking disorders:''''\n\n- Dystonia: (hyperkinetic motor disorder) pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, \"heron\" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, \"dromedary gait\" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.\n\n- Chorea: (hyperkinetic motor disorder)\n\n- Tremor (primary orthostatic tremor)\n\n- Trendelenburg lameness (instability with lowering of the pelvis on the non-weight-bearing side)",

The management of errors and complaints; the therapeutic hazard\n|Rank=A\n|Title=Knowing the definition of disciplinary liability\n|Description=None\n|Rubric=Definition\n|Contributors=Bastien Boussat\n|Order=5}}\n\nDisciplinary liability is that incurred before the bodies of the Ordre des Médecins. Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor (civil or criminal).\n\n'''Misconduct and disciplinary sanctions'''\n\nDisciplinary offences\n\nAny breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des Médecins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.\n\nThis Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des médecins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.\n\nDisciplinary sanctions\n\nThe penalties incurred are a warning, a reprimand, a temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities, a temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years) or removal from the roll of the Ordre.\n\nTemporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.\n\n'''Implementation of disciplinary liability'''\n\n'''Jurisdictions'''\n\nThe competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.\n\n'''Referral'''\n\nReferrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by a departmental council of the Ordre, the national council of the Ordre, a doctor, a doctors' union, the director of the regional health agency, the prefect, the public prosecutor and the minister responsible for health.\n\nFor doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to the Conseil départemental de l'Ordre, the Conseil national de l'Ordre, the Director of the Regional Health Agency, the Prefect, the Public Prosecutor and the Minister for Health.\n\nA patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil départemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation.\n\nIf this fails, the Conseil départemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil régional de l'Ordre.\n\n'''Procedure'''\n\nThe patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague. Proceedings before the Order's courts are adversarial; the hearing is public.",

This means that people with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection. The incidence of prosthesis-related IE is estimated at around 5% at 5 years.\n\nEarly AEs (<1 year after implantation) result from peri-operative contamination (catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation, etc.). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).\n\nLate IEs (>1 year after implantation) originate from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are therefore those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).\n\n\nClinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. In addition, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.\n\nThe diagnostic strategy for ARs on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves (see item 152).\n\nAntibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.\n\nThe indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following being particularly favourable: the presence of clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, an uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, the presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by \"Staphylococcus Aureus\".\n\nThe prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends above all on clear information being given to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.\n\nTherapeutic education is essential, particularly with regard to signs that should prompt consultation (prolonged fever, AEG). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.\n\nDental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.\n\nThe antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure. In the event of allergy, Clindamycin is used (600mg in adults, 20mg/kg in children).",

Active on the liver, reduces hepatic glucose production, in particular hepatic gluconeogenesis (uncertain effect on the intestine). Frequent digestive side effects. Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and <u>formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min</u>. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n* Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (sulphonylureas): Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc). They are associated with '''glinides''' (<u>repaglinide</u>) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: <u>hypoglycaemia</u> and weight gain [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics variable depending on the molecule and <u>therefore variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides</u>. <u>No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.</u>\n\n* '''Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (colloquially DPP4, family: \"gliptins\").''' Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). <u>Posology to be adjusted to renal function.</u> Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.\n\n* '''GLP1 receptor agonists (colloquially GLP1 agonists).''' Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. <Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia.</u> Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.\n\n* '''Intestinal alphaglucosidase inhibitor,''' only representative: <u>acarbose</u>. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.\n\n* '''SGLT2 inhibitors.''' Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. <u>Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects [[Adult heart failure]] [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]</u>. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation. Can be prescribed up to a GFR of 25 ml/min.",

Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).\n\n'''Attention'''\n\n- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''', '''[[Mental Confusion/Disorientation SD-119|mental Confusion/Disorientation]]''' (which result from severe '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''') and '''[[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and Consciousness Disorder]]'''''\n\n- Attention is necessary for all the major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.\n\n- Tests by repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.\n\n'''Perceptual integration functions'''\n\n- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects and the body schema.\n\n- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe), and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.\n\n- '''Temporal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Aphasia''' ('''[[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]]''') by impairment of comprehension, '''visual agnosia''' (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects (colours or shapes) or more complex ones (faces, manufactured or living objects)\n\no Tests understanding of simple commands (\"close your eyes\"), naming of objects or faces.\n\n- '''Parietal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Apraxia''' (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), '''visual neglect''' '''unilateral''', i.e. inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), '''disturbance of the representation of the body schema'' (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc).\n\no Tested by copying a geometric figure (MMSE image), drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (\"military salute\", \"nose-thumbing\") and gestures involving the use of objects (\"brushing teeth\", \"combing hair\", \"playing the violin\", \"hammering a nail\").\n\n'''Memory'''\n\n- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.) but in the tests, ''episodic memory'' is mainly assessed.\n\n- '''Episodic memory''' :\n\no the ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e. the place, the moment, the emotional state)\n\no the critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or \"consolidation\")\n\no depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the ''hippocampi'' and adjacent cortices.\n\no Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to \"progressive forgetting\" (\"What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?\").\n\n- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.\n\no 1. read five words (\"Museum\", \"Lemonade\", \"Colander\", \"Grasshopper\" and \"Truck\") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (\"What is the drink?\"...).\n\no 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).\n\no 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g. a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.\n\n'''Executive functions'''\n\n- Mental operations enabling the individual to '''understand the context'' of the action, to d''''inhibit automatic or reflexive behaviour'' and to '''generate voluntary behaviour'' directed towards a goal.\n\n- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.\n\n- '''Dysexecutive syndrome''' leads to a lack of contextualisation (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgement and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviours (repetitive and stereotyped ''[<nowiki/>[[Obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour SDD-136|obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour]]]''') and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food ''[<nowiki/>[[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SDD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]]''', disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).\n\n- Tested using the ''rapid frontal efficiency battery'' (BREF)",

Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries. The \"social assistance logic\" allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (for example, in the context of what are known as minimum social benefits, such as the revenu de solidarité active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicapé [AAH] or the fonds de solidarité vieillesse [FSV]). '''The logic of universal protection''' covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits). The ''individual protection logic'' is based on savings (e.g. the decision to buy dental implants) and private insurance, while ''collective protection'' is based on the pooling of risks.",

CCHD is the result of an abnormality in the antenatal development of the hip, leading to instability of the joint or even dislocation at birth.  The risk factors for LCH are :  - family history of 1st degree CHL; - breech presentation whatever the mode of delivery; - limitation of unilateral or bilateral hip abduction; - congenital asymmetric pelvis;\n\n- associated postural abnormalities ('genu recurvatum', torticollis).\n\nScreening consists of a clinical examination at birth and then at each consultation until walking age and looks for :\n\n- asymmetry of the folds and lengths of the lower limbs;\n\n- abduction limitation <60°;\n\n- instability of the hip using the Barlow manoeuvre, which reveals a protrusion in the case of a \"dislocatable hip\" or \"reducible dislocated hip\". In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry.\n\nIf there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for LCH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed. After 4 months, the reference examination is a pelvic X-ray.\n\n# '''Hearing screening (Hearing loss/deafness)''' 5% of children under the age of 6 have a hearing defect. Congenital CMV infection is the leading cause of congenital deafness Risk factors for congenital deafness are :  - family history; - birth before 32 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <1800g; - perinatal asphyxia; - hyperbilirubinaemia >350 µmol/L; - neurological disorders; - malformation of the face and neck; - foetopathy (CMV, rubella, herpes, toxoplasmosis); - ototoxic treatment Screening is carried out systematically in maternity wards using induced acoustic emission tests (EAPT). If the examination is abnormal on two occasions, the newborn is referred to an ENT specialist for a check-up. If abnormalities are confirmed on examination, an audiogram and auditory evoked potentials will be carried out in a specialist centre.\n# '''Visual screening''' The risk factors for visual problems are :  - prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation; - neurological disorders; - deafness; - chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, etc.); - craniostenosis, craniofacial dysostoses; - embryo-fetopathies (toxoplasmosis); - in utero exposure to cocaine, alcohol; - family history of hereditary ophthalmological disease (congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, etc.).  Screening is based on clinical examination: - eyelids: ptosis, epicanthus, angioma; - eyeballs: microphthalmia, buphthalmia; - conjunctivae: redness, tearing; - corneas: symmetry of corneal reflections, corneal opacity; - pupils: leukocoria (retinoblastoma, cataract), aniscoria (neuroblastoma); - iris.  The examination assesses ocular pursuit with a target and looks for the presence of nystagmus.\n\nIntermittent and alternating strabismus may indicate delayed acquisition of oculomotricity up to the age of 3 months. Permanent or divergent strabismus, whatever the age, or present after the age of 3 months, should be considered pathological ('''[[Child Strabismus SD-157|Strabismus]]'')''.",

Atopy is considered to be a risk factor for developing immediate hypersensitivity symptoms (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic urticaria).\n\n'''Awareness'''\n\nA term classically used in atopy, defined by the presence of an immediate positive skin test to an allergen, without prejudging any clinical reaction of an allergic type. This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitised without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.\n\n'''Allergy'''\n\nHypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes). Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitisation and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).\n\n\n'''Allergens''' = antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n- Pneumallergens = airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.\n\n- Trophallergens = food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.\n\n- Occupational allergens = allergens present in the workplace\n\n'''Physiopathology of allergic hypersensitivities'''\n\nAll allergic hypersensitivities have two phases\n\n- A phase of ''central sensitisation'' ''in the lymph nodes'', ''asymptomatic'', which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3, see below), or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4, see below).\n\n- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.\n\n\nThere are 4 types of hypersensitivity\n\n\n1- Type 1 hypersensitivity or immediate hypersensitivity\n\no This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).\n\no It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens,\n\no After their synthesis (sensitisation phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.\n\no During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to :\n\n§ the ''release of stored mediators'' (histamine, proteases);\n\n§ the ''synthesis of other inflammatory mediators'' from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes);\n\n§ the production of ''chemokines'', which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and ''cytokines'', which perpetuate inflammation.\n\no These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation and oedema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis (''cf Lisa item 338'').\n\no Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.\n\n\nDiagram of IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity\n\n\nType 2 hypersensitivity or antibody-related cytotoxicity reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise an \"allergen carried by a target cell\".\n\n- Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.\n\n- Example: drug-induced cytopenia\n\n\nType 3 hypersensitivity or immune complex reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise a \"circulating allergen\".\n\n- Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or \"circulating immune complexes\")\n\n- which are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells;\n\n- Example: hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.\n\n\nType 4 hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity\n\n- Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitisation phase. The memory T cells recognise the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.\n\n\nFor example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema (cf Lisa item 187) and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g. pulmonary granulomatosis).",

It is arbitrarily divided into three compartments, which are often defined as such on a profile X-ray (Figure 1):\n\n*The ''anterior mediastinum'', which contains fatty tissue, the thymus and ganglion chains.\n*The middle mediastinum, which contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.\n*The '''posterior mediastinum''', which contains the descending thoracic aorta, oesophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, lymph node chains\n<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"400\">\nFile:Mediast1.jpg|'''Figure 1.''' Segmentation of the mediastinum illustrated on profile chest radiograph. In blue: anterior mediastinum; in green: middle mediastinum; in yellow: posterior mediastinum.\n</gallery>\n\n\nMediastinal abnormalities may correspond to :\n\n*The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Example: mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumour, paraspinal abscess, bronchogenic cyst, etc.\n*''An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure.'' Example: aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, cardiomegaly.\n*''An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure'' in the mediastinum. Example: intra-thoracic thyroid goitre, hiatal hernia.\n\n\nThe main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are summarised in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Anterior mediastinum\n|Middle mediastinum\n|Posterior mediastinum'''\n|-\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|-\n|Thymic tumours\n|Bronchogenic cysts\n|Neurogenic tumours\n|-\n|Germ Cell Tumours\n|Vascular dilations\n|Oesophageal tumours\n|-\n|Thyroid gland\n|\n|Hiatal hernia\n|-\n|Pleuropericardial cyst\n|\n|\n|}\n\n\nOn a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality ''is characterised by an opacity''.\n\n*A clear external boundary convex towards the lung\n*Gently sloping into the mediastinum\n*Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements\n*Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum\n\n[[File:Bords mediastinaux.jpg|vignette|'''Figure 2.''' Mediastinal borders. BC: brachiocephalic. In blue: upper arches, in green: middle arches, in yellow: lower arches]]\n\nThe ''mediastinal contours'' (Figure 2) are therefore often distorted. On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava. On the left, the superior arch corresponds to the left subclavian artery, the middle arch to the aortic button and pulmonary artery, and the inferior arch to the left ventricle.<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"550\">\n</gallery>\n\n\nThe left pulmonary hilum is always slightly higher than the right. Normal pulmonary hili are never convex.\n\nA frequently encountered mediastinal anomaly is cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly is defined on a chest X-ray taken in the standing position only, by a '''cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5'' (Figure 3).<gallery widths=\"500\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediast3.JPG|'''Figure 3'''. Cardiothoracic index. The dotted line passes through the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae. The index is calculated by the ratio (c+c')/t\n</gallery>\n\n\nWhile chest X-rays can detect mediastinal abnormalities, thoracic CT is the examination of choice for ''pinpointing the location of the abnormality and characterising the lesion''. Mediastinal MRI may also be indicated in certain special cases.\n\nExample of mediastinal abnormalities on chest radiograph (with CT images provided for illustration) : Figures 4-7<gallery widths=\"475\" heights=\"275\">\nFile:Mediast4.JPG|'''Figure 4''' A.

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196°C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",

The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. There are many other causes: intra-alveolar haemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organised pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.\n\nThe definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:\n\n*pulmonary opacity (denser or \"whiter\" than normal parenchyma)\n*containing images of aerated bronchi (= aerated bronchogram)\n\nThe term \"systemic\" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe (Figure 1). The silhouette sign can help to localise the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term \"retractile\" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, we speak of ''''''athelectasis''.\n\nCT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray, and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary oedema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.<gallery widths=\"700\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Alv1.JPG|'''Figure 1.''' Front chest X-ray showing a systematised opacity of the right upper lobe with a clear stop at the contact of the small scissure (blue arrows).

Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.\n\nWhen the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.\n\nThe classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:\n\n- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)\n\n- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)\n\n- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)\n\n- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in \"looking for associated lesions\": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",

Three types of CI are classically distinguished:\n\nØ ''Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%)'' caused by failure of myocardial contraction.\n\nØ ''Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%'' generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.\n\nØ '''Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction LVEF ≥50%.''' This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).\n\n\nThis definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%).\n\n\n[[File:Figure 1.png|centred|thumb|600x600px|LVEF calculation : Top: LVEF formula and the 3 limits used for the types of CI.

These have redefined the way in which we see and conceive of illnesses, but also the way in which we apprehend our bodies. As an artefact between carer and patient, between observer and observed, they redefine the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body, and transform the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images and data that can be reductionist.\n\nThe resulting observation is accompanied by its own terminology, which can also lead to distancing and create a gap between what is experienced by the patient (their subjective experience) and the way in which medicine objectifies their body.\n\nWhen it comes to the human body, the human sciences most often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The first is simply a body among bodies, impersonal, governed by natural laws, devoid of specifically human characteristics, an object of action or contemplation. The second, the subject-body, designates both the subjective body, as the psychophysiological substratum of the individual experience of the body, and the subject's body, as the dimension of corporeity on which the action of the human subject is exercised. In the world of healthcare, this distinction makes it possible to relativise and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without falling into the easy reductionism that would consist of directing the carer's attention to a single aspect of physicality.

The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.\n*The quantity of H<sup>+</sup> entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> ⇔ H2CO3 ⇔ CO2 + H2O\n*This buffer system is said to be \"open\" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.\n*Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH<sub>blood</sub> = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/[H2CO3]) = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/0.03 PC02)\n*The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO2 and HCO3<sup>-</sup> is modified, i.e. :\n**when there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO3<sup>-</sup> ions. This is known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis,\n**or when there is a primary change in PCO2. This is known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.\n\nB.    The main sources of acid\n\n*There are two main sources of acid:\n**Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O2, water and CO2 (oxidative metabolism). The CO2 generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO2 leads to respiratory acidosis.\n**Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H2SO4 for sulphur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H2P04 for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.\n\nC.    Role of the lung in acid-base balance\n\n*By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO2 of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO2 through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO2 by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.\n*Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO2 and pCO2, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.\n\nD.    Role of the kidney in acid-base balance\n\n*Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.\n*Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",

It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   \n\nThe Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It \"aims to control social and health spending\". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.\n\nIt should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.\n\nThe LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.\n\nSince 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.\n\nExamples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.gouvernement.fr/presentation-du-projet-de-loi-de-financement-de-la-securite-sociale-2022</nowiki>",

Ethics and prenatal diagnosis (PND) ==\nPrenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all \"medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero\". This activity is carried out under the supervision of the Agence de biomédecine, a public body created by the law of 6 August 2004.\n\nIts main tools are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis or cordocentesis). Faced with the fear that these techniques could be used to satisfy the desire for \"perfect\" children, ethical considerations led the legislator to introduce a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The text of the law as it stood on 6 August 2004 specified the purpose of PND: \"to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child\".\n\nThe application of advances in foetal imaging and human genetics to foetal medicine is highly questionable. Medical genetics initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, with the discovery in 1956 of the existence of a trisomy of chromosome 21 in the cells of patients suffering from the disease then known as \"mongolism\". Gradually, it became possible to harvest foetal cells from pregnant women using the amniocentesis technique. This marked the birth of prenatal diagnosis, first for trisomy 21 and then rapidly for a dozen other chromosomal anomalies. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis then expanded considerably, due in particular to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring of pregnancies, the appearance of biological techniques for analysing serum markers to assess the risk of trisomy 21 and molecular biology techniques.\n\nHowever, as progress in PND is much more rapid than that in therapy, recognising a disease often means realising that there is no treatment available to cure it, leading some couples to request termination of the pregnancy because of a disease that their future child will (perhaps) develop early, but also, in some cases, late after 30, 40 or 50 years.\n\nIt is then up to the CPDPN to interpret the meaning given in practice to \"a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis\" (Public Health Code).\n\nFrance is one of the few countries to authorise IMG \"at any time during pregnancy\" and the legislator, supported by the National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), has never wished to draw up a list of diseases giving access to IMG, in particular to avoid automatic decision-making (which would not take account of individual situations) and the stigmatisation of a group of people. Indeed, when faced with a request for an IMG, a CPDPN cannot exclude considering the context (the history, culture, representations and convictions of each of the parents), which may lead to different decisions from one couple to another, from one CPDPN to another, for the same pathology. The law therefore leaves a great deal to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and the expression \"particular seriousness\" may be interpreted in different ways by different families and teams. This freedom means that the experience, sensitivity and background of each couple can be taken into account in their decision.\n\nToday, the CPDPNs are faced with certain requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases for which prevention and/or treatment may or may not exist. One example is the case of foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene (which increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer) in families marked by numerous early deaths linked to these diseases. In these situations, requests for IMG have been deemed justified by the family history, which then becomes a criterion of \"particular seriousness\". However, some people question the legitimacy of certain requests.\n\nThe question underlying this whole debate is that of the criteria legitimising a medical decision to terminate a pregnancy. In the case of medical reasons relating to the preservation of the mother's life, there is little debate on this issue, as medicine gives priority to the person \"present\", in this case the mother. On the other hand, in the case of foetal impairment, the underlying issue is a serious one, and ties in with that of the acceptance of disability in our society. Some people, including medical practitioners, although not opposed to abortion, fear that society could slide into a situation where, because there are not enough facilities for the care of disabled children, parents would be encouraged, in an unspoken way, to resort more systematically to abortion. Another question, which is too often avoided by both medical and parental authorities, is: what quality of life can be guaranteed to people whose level of awareness and capacity for autonomy are sometimes difficult to assess?\n\nThe very terms of the law must therefore be questioned in the ethical process of deciding whether or not to terminate a pregnancy:\n\n   - High probability\": you don't have to be 100% sure that a child carrying the mutation will develop a serious disease. Some couples say they don't want to take the slightest risk. But isn't having a child already taking a risk? Others consider that a 25% risk, for example, is acceptable because it means that there is a 75% chance that their baby will be fine. So how we assess the notion of probability depends on each person and their history;\n\n   - incurability\": there may be diseases that are curable but \"disabling\", but behind this handicap, some people put variable notions ranging from \"acceptable\" to \"unbearable\". This involves an assessment of comfort and quality of life. Here again, incurability is a fairly subjective concept whose interpretation can vary from one individual to another;\n\n   - Particular seriousness\": the concept of seriousness also varies greatly from one person to another. What is a serious illness, and for whom? Who decides? Is it serious for the child, for his or her parents, for the doctor, for society? This question arises particularly in the case of diseases that cause intellectual impairment: systematic screening for trisomy 21 is a perfect illustration. When is an illness serious? At birth, in childhood, in adulthood or after the age of 50? How serious is a disease? When it affects a finger, a hand, the whole body, motor functions, cognitive functions? These questions illustrate the density and complexity of the discussions held within the CPDPN. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is necessary, as it is not only their perception of the seriousness of the disease that is at stake, but also their philosophy of life. This dialogue requires a great deal of time and energy on the part of multidisciplinary teams (doctor, geneticist, genetic counsellor, obstetrician, psychologist) whose main role is to support the couple as they work towards a decision.\n\n== B. The specific case of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) ==\nSince 2013, a new screening test for trisomy 21 has gradually come onto the market in France. This is the non-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT), which uses research and analysis of foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood. By simply taking a blood sample from the pregnant woman, this test makes it possible to detect trisomy 21 at a much earlier stage (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea - SA) and with a higher level of performance. The discovery of foetal DNA circulating freely in maternal plasma was described in 1997. Analysis of foetal DNA in maternal blood has already been used for many years in certain antenatal diagnostic indications, such as determining foetal sex in X-linked recessive diseases and genotyping foetal Rhesus D in Rhesus D-negative women. Until 2011, the quality of these techniques meant that they could not be reliably applied to the search for trisomy 21. Today, thanks to advances in new high-throughput sequencing techniques, the screening test for trisomy 21 based on analysis of free foetal DNA in maternal blood has a sensitivity of close to 99.9% and a specificity of 99.8% in high-risk populations.\n\nThis progress is revolutionising the practice of PND insofar as, in addition to trisomy 21, the technique is making it possible to study other characteristics of the foetal genome, with new indications and requests for prescriptions. Current debates are therefore focusing on the conditions of access to this test, not only for trisomy 21, but also for the search for other anomalies (search for risk markers potentially predictive of diseases such as cancers or other pathologies) or access to sex diagnosis.\n\nIt has been proposed that the implementation of the study of foetal DNA in maternal blood should be the subject of applied research, in the field of clinical practice, in order to gain a better understanding of the issues and perceptions of professionals and patients. The preferences of patients and professionals may differ, and the latter may be 'subjected' to the pressure of women's demands.\n\nWill the rules for prescribing these new tests be consensual? Won't the globalisation of access to healthcare and access to e-health via the Internet mean that women will carry out tests on their own, then come back to their doctors with the results and requests for treatment? It will therefore be necessary to assess these attitudes and changes and the nature of the requests, and probably to devise new frameworks and new rules. This will undoubtedly be one of the issues at stake in the forthcoming review of the bioethics laws.\n\nThere is also the question of the impact of this development of the DPNI on requests for terminations of pregnancy. The possibility of carrying out the DPNI test before the end of the first trimester raises a fundamental question: as this test can be carried out at an early stage, even before the first trimester ultrasound, the result can also be given to the patient very quickly, i.e. before the legal term for voluntary termination of pregnancy of 16 SA (weeks of amenorrhoea), potentially allowing direct access to an abortion based, in fact, on this biological result. This development may therefore call into question the spirit of French law, which historically sought to make a clear distinction between two situations: the first, abortion (within a time limit of 16 weeks' gestation) where the woman did not wish to have a child or was unable to welcome one at that point in her life (a situation then described as maternal distress, i.e. with a psycho-social component), and the second, IMG (termination for maternal and/or foetal medical reasons), with no time limit, but currently subject to prior agreement following expertise by a CPDPN reference centre. If the results of the DPNI are communicated to the woman before 16 weeks' gestation and she requests an abortion, the ethical framework of the decision changes completely. Some couples may be tempted to have an abortion, even when the risk of illness has been judged to be low by the doctors or the potential \"anomaly\" to be of little seriousness.\n\nAs far as healthcare professionals are concerned, the future status of the DPNI will undoubtedly need to be clarified so that women are aware of the place it will have in the pregnancy monitoring strategy. To date, some studies show that the number of professionals who do not wish to prescribe this new test at all is low, but that there is a real debate on the legitimate indications and questions associated with its use.\n\n== Key points\n   - PND (prenatal diagnosis) is the set of medical practices designed to detect a serious condition (genetic anomaly, chromosomal abnormality or malformation) in the embryo or foetus in utero, in order to give the future parents the choice of whether or not to terminate the pregnancy and to allow better medical management of the pathology if the pregnancy is continued.\n\n   - When a foetal anomaly is detected, it is up to the CPDPN (multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre) to certify that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition that is incurable at the time of diagnosis. If the pregnant woman so decides, this certificate enables her to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds.\n\nThe technique of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) would allow selection of foetal sex or access to genetic screening for markers of pathology or risk at an early stage in pregnancy. It is easy to understand why, while supporting the emergence of NIPT, it may be necessary to target the indications carefully and possibly discuss the timing of the return of results before or after the time limit for voluntary termination of pregnancy.",

Ageing alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain remains ''under-estimated and under-treated'' and treatment must be ''individualised and adapted'' according to the patient's state of health (''co-morbidities and chronic treatments, state of emunctory functions).\n\n- Acute pain: certain acute pathologies that are usually painful in adults (myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, fractures) can be \"silent\" in the elderly, who often present late at the emergency department, consult and report their pain later than younger adults, with more complications that can be serious or even fatal.\n\n- Chronic pain: the prevalence is \"high\", affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions, with a variety of aetiologies (osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, iatrogenic, etc.).\n\n- Pain management is based on '''4 pillars:''' '''R'''epérage,''''E'''appraisal,''''T'''raitement and always Re-'''E'''appraisal of pain in order to judge the effectiveness of the approach adopted. It includes the care teams and/or the family.\n\n\n'''<u>Know the particularities of pain management in the elderly</u>''''\n\n\n'''Spotting'''\n\n- Some types of pain are predictable (pain during care, pressure sores, etc.), even if this is not specific to the elderly (see \"Prevalence and epidemiology\" section), while others are more difficult to anticipate (paroxysmal attacks of pain) or to identify.\n\n- You need to look for \"warning signs\" and have a pain reflex, especially if the behaviour is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming.\n\n- Any elderly person who expresses pain or behaviour suggestive of pain is indeed in pain. We need to apply the \"precautionary principle\" and fight against preconceived ideas, beliefs, fears and representations held by patients and those around them, such as \"It's normal to be in pain when you're old\".\n\n\n'''Evaluation'''\n\n- The patient will be correctly seated (environment, wearing of glasses, hearing aids and dental prostheses), with an empathetic and patient approach, a climate of trust and taking into account any cognitive or expressive difficulties.\n\n- A \"geriatric assessment\" (including depression and behaviour) is carried out in addition to identifying the components of the pain.\n\n- Self-assessment is carried out using a simple numerical or verbal scale rather than the VAS. In the event of failure, an observation of behaviours using a ''hetero-evaluation'' scale (Algoplus®, Doloplus®, ECPA®) is used, preferably in a team, and this evaluation is repeated regularly.\n\n\n'''Treatment'''\n\n- Ageing ''modifies the pharmacology'' (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy) of drugs, including analgesics. The analgesics and coantalgesics used are the same as those used by younger adults, but the adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous because of \"co-morbidities and polymedication\". The contribution of clinical pharmacists can be useful in screening for drug-related iatrogenia and in drug conciliation.\n\n- Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexists in the elderly.\n\n- Before any analgesic is prescribed, the patient's state of health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation and compliance must be ascertained. Dosage adjustments are recommended, dosages increased slowly (\"start low and go slow\"), and renal function monitored.\n\n- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.\n\n- It is recommended that analgesics be combined with non-pharmacological techniques, which are perfectly feasible with a few adaptations to the sensory deficits caused by ageing (sight, hearing, mobility).\n\n\n'''Revaluation'''\n\n- Always reassess to ''adapt and prioritise'' treatments in order to reduce multi-medication and optimise the benefit-risk balance.\n\n- An elderly patient who does not complain can be painful.",

By improving patients' physical condition and developing their social interactions, sporting activities help to prevent the onset of these chronic pathologies, increase overall life expectancy and improve the quality of life of patients of all ages ([Connaitre les principaux effets de l'activité physique et de la condition physique sur la santé en prévention primaire 2C-248-ET-A01|item 248]]).\n\n\nIn children, daily physical activity is necessary for the development and improvement of motor and physical skills.\n\nPractising sport has beneficial effects on mental health (increased self-esteem, reduced anxiety) and physical health (prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome). What's more, an individual who takes part in sporting activities as a child is more likely to do so as an adult. Physical activity in childhood therefore partly determines the health of future adults.\n\nInvolving children in competitions allows them to develop their social interactions and to test themselves against others, and is a vehicle for motivation and progress.\n\n\nAt any age, the risks of practising sport are :\n\n- Mainly cardiovascular.\n\nWhile regular physical activity has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, the fact remains that cardiovascular risk is transiently increased during intense physical exercise (increased cardiac output and arterial pressure during exercise), compared with the situation at rest.\n\nThis is why the [[Knowing the main causes of contraindications to practising sport 2C-256-DE-A01|main contraindications to practising sport]] are cardiovascular, and why [[Knowing how to conduct a medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport in adults 2C-256-PC-B01|the medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport]] focuses on the cardiovascular system.\n\n- Traumatic, depending on the type of sporting activity.",

In this situation, it can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided that it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and must demonstrate that it has identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator. This is demonstrated in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may, however, contain excipients that are different from those of the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, colour and taste of a generic drug may also be different from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.\n\n==Authorisation of generic medicinal products ==\nGeneric medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. In practice, marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine on the basis of the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. The latter type of study must be randomised, cross-over and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin (medicines for which a small variation in concentration will modify the effect of the medicine), the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.\n\n==''Substitution of a generic drug'''==\nGeneric drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.\n\nAs prescriptions must be in INN, the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine are authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic.\n\nThe prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must take account of the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:\n\n*In particular, if the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.\n*If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed.\n\n==Refusal to substitute ==\nUnder very specific conditions, requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, he/she must write \"non-substitutable\" on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in 3 situations:\n\n*Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.\n*Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product in the event that this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.\n*Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.\n\nPharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled \"non-substitutable\" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.\n\n==''Biosimilar medicinal product'''==\nA biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, the complexity of the molecule and the difficulty involved in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.\n\n==Authorisation of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBiosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.\n\nIf a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g. marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n==Interchangeability of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBy definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment, but requires: informing the patient and obtaining his or her consent; recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file; and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",

This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e. it tends to bias the results of the study in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference.\n* or ''differential'', i.e. the risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favour of the null hypothesis of no difference, or in favour of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.  \n\n'''Selection bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomisation prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimise these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.  \n\n'''Classification bias'''\n\n* <u>nondifferential</u>: occurs when the classification error on the judgement criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgement criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words bring the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.\n* <u>differential</u>: occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgement criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgement criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls. Generally speaking, these biases can be limited by using data collection procedures that are as standardised and objective as possible, and that are similar for all subjects included in the study.",

It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).\n\nThere are two pathophysiological phases:\n\n#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to naïve LTCD8+. The naïve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.\n#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification.jpg|vignette|Figure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification]]\n\n\nFigure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity according to the Gel and Coombs classification.\n\nModel of allergic contact eczema.\n\nAsymptomatic sensitisation phase (production of allergen-specific T lymphocytes on first contact)\n\nReveal phase on new contact (clinical eczema)",

It is characterised by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.\n\nHorton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) is the cause to be considered first, even though it is not the most common cause, due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered as an \"emergency\". A systematic search should therefore be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease; changes in the temporal arteries; suggestive ocular signs (episode(s) of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography, indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), temporal artery biopsy (this should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralisation and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids as a matter of urgency.\n\nArteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. One or more risk factors are generally present: smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.\n\n=== '''Papilledema''' ===\nThis is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.\n\nIn cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.\n\n=== '''Retro-bulbar optic neuritis (RBON)''' ===\nDamage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.\n\n\nOther causes of optic nerve damage include:\n\n- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: these neuropathies have in common that they are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead), metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).\n\n- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumours or tumours in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n== Damage to the optic chiasm ==\nCompression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as \"chiasmatic syndrome\" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e. a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibres which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.\n\n== Retrochiasmatic disease ==\nThis results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibres travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive haematoma), tumour and trauma.\n\nA sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumour etiology.",

These contributions are for health, maternity, disability and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the \"contribution solidarité autonomie\" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.\n\nSocial security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favour of fiscal resources, on the one hand the CSG (general social contribution), and on the other hand exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include: transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme); taxes on products (taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance, etc.); taxes on wages and labour; taxes on income and wealth: this is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG, plus the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). State public contributions'' finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidise schemes.\n\nGraph 1: Origin of social protection resources (pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners).<gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig 1.png\n</gallery>Source: DREES.

There is a decline in the share of social contributions due to the drop in professional activity during 2020 (confinements). This illustrates the importance of economic activity in generating financial resources for social protection.<gallery>\nFile:19 G2 resources.png\n</gallery>",

Do not confuse ''thermal medicine'' with ''hydrotherapy'' (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or ''thalassotherapy'' (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognised nor reimbursed by the Health Insurance) or ''Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine''.\n\n==Waters used in Thermal Medicine ==\nThey are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The \"thermality\" separates \"cold\" waters (8 to 15°C, mainly for diuresis cures), \"mesothermal\" waters (25 to 34°C, for prolonged baths) and \"hyperthermal\" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The \"mineralisation\" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as :\n\n#SULPHUR: H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the \"Pyrenean\" type or calcic;\n#SULPHATE: urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium;\n#SODIQUE CHLORIDES: rich in sodium\n#GAS BARBONATES: sodium or calcium;\n#WITH A RARE ELEMENT: arsenic, iron, copper, selenium;\n#LOW MINERAL content: (trace metals).\n\nNB: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (\"griffon\") and to carry out the treatment on site.\n\nOther thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S) and mud (peloids).\n\n=='''Thermal techniques with 3 main types of cures <small>([[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explain a treatment to the patient]])</small>'''==\n\n#Internal hydrotherapy based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 litres per day) are used for digestive, urinary or metabolic disorders.\n#Contact\" cures: application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.\n#''External hydrotherapy'' uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional or general, of varying temperature, pressure and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.\n\nThe other thermal techniques are ''functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine'' (physiotherapy, postural drainage and respiratory re-education) and also health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place. '''([[Prescription of a rehabilitation SDD-247|Prescription of a rehabilitation]])''''\n\n== '''Spa resorts in France'''==\n'''Around a hundred spa resorts in France:''' firstly in Occitanie (200,000 spa visitors/year), then in Nouvelle Aquitaine (150,000 spa visitors/year) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (130,000 spa visitors/year). The 3 main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL) and Gréoux (RH, VR).\n\n==Indications for spa treatment ==\nChronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialisation in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters). There are 12 therapeutic orientations for spas recognised by the French social security system, and spas may have 2 (exceptionally 3) therapeutic orientations.\n\n#RH : Rheumatology and sequelae of osteo-articular trauma ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]])''''\n#Respiratory tract diseases (ENT or pneumology)\n#MCA : Cardio-Arterial Diseases\n#AU : Diseases of the Urinary System and Metabolic Diseases\n#AD: Diseases of the Digestive System and Metabolic Diseases\n#PHL: Phlebology\n#GYN: Gynaecology\n#DER: Dermatology\n#AMB: Oral and lingual mucosal diseases\n#NEU : Neurology\n#PSY: Psychosomatic disorders\n#''TDE : Troubles du Développement de l'Enfant'' [[Anomalie du développement psychomoteur SD-115|'''(Anomaly of psychomotor development)''']]\n\nNB: obsolete information is shown in italics.\n\nSince the early 2000s, under the aegis of the AFRETH (Association Française de REcherche THermale - French Association for Thermal Research), several high-quality clinical trials have been carried out, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of thermal medicine in its main indications. The most validated indications are rheumatology (osteoarthritis, chronic lumbago, inflammatory rheumatism outside flare-ups), followed by arteritis and psychiatry (generalised anxiety disorders).\n\n==Undesirable effects of spa treatments ==\nVery rare and often \"non-serious\": asthenia after a few days of treatment (\"spa crisis\"), complications of treatment techniques, etc. \n\n==Contraindications to spa treatments ==\nObvious non-indications such as infections, cancers, relapsing illnesses, recent cardiovascular diseases, immunodepression, etc.\n\n=='''How to prescribe a spa treatment?'''==\n'''([[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|Drafting a prescription/medical letter]])''''\n\nThe cure is prescribed by the attending physician on a special form to be sent to the Caisse d'AM with its 2 sections: prise en charge (completed by the prescribing physician) and déclaration de ressources (completed by the insured person).

It can be carried out with sperm from a spouse ('''IAC'') or from a donor ('''IAD'').\n\nInsemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to obtain maturation of one to three follicles, or induction of ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders ([[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|Menstrual Cycle Disorders]]: anovulation or dysovulation).  \n\nPelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation. This is known as ovulation monitoring.\n\nOvulation is triggered by injection of recombinant hCG to synchronise ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition.\n\nThe day after the induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory, under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected (similar to the migration-survival test, see LISA sheet for item 38). The sperm preparation is inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.            \n\n*In Vitro Fertilisation''''' conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.\n\n<u>Ovarian stimulation</u> under supervision (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) by administration of high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked at the same time by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n\nThese protocols require ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH and progesterone levels). The aim of this monitoring is to :\n\n*check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing),\n*choose the optimum day for ovulation induction,\n*identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g. insufficient ovarian response).\n\nOvulation is triggered when several follicles have reached a size greater than 16 mm by injection of either an hCG analogue (recombinant hCG) or a GnRH agonist.\n\n<u>Follicular puncture</u> (of the follicular fluid) is performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anaesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory where it is examined for cumulo-ovocyte complexes.\n\n<u>Sperm preparation</u> is carried out in the majority of cases using a '''sperm sample taken by masturbation'' on the day of the follicular puncture. However, it is also possible to use frozen sperm from a spouse or a third-party donor. It is also possible to use sperm taken surgically (either from testicular tissue (testicular biopsy) or from the liquid in the epididymis (epididymal puncture)) in cases of azoospermia (sperm which will then be used fresh or after freezing). Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinised urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). The spermatozoa recovered are prepared according to the \"in vitro\" fertilisation technique envisaged.\n\n<u>Fertilisation</u> is either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).\n\n<u>Culture and embryo transfer</u>: after fertilisation of the oocytes by sperm, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on a number of factors.\n\nA pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.\n\n<u>Embryo freezing</u>: non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and then kept in storage tanks containing liquid nitrogen (-196°C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are first thawed and then transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.\n\n\nThe MPA can be :\n\n*intra-marital'' (using the gametes, oocytes and spermatozoa of both members of the couple)\n*or with the intervention of a ''third party donor'' (sperm donor, oocyte donor or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure and for which the couple no longer have any parental plans).\n\nDouble gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible (French Bioethics Act 2021).\n\nPGM can be carried out in the context of \"viral risk\" (HIV, hepatitis B and/or C) in centres approved for this activity. Finally, one of the techniques used in MAP is \"pre-implantation diagnosis\" (PGD), the aim of which is to diagnose genetic anomalies (genes, chromosomes) in embryonic cells. Only a few AMP centres are authorised to carry out PGD in France.\n\n<br />",

Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.\n\n- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics\n\n- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal and cardiac complications.\n<br />\n\n=== '''Indications''' ===\n- Fever: low dose\n\n- Pain:\n\no ''Acute pain'': dental pain, ''postoperative pain'', ''post-traumatic pain'', ''headaches'' or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.\n\no Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.\n\n- inflammation: higher dosage\n\nacute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, ''spinal pain'' and ''radicular pain'' and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.\n\n- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.\n\n\n=== '''Contraindications''' ===\n- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.\n\n- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).\n\n- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).\n\n- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.\n\n- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.\n\n- Haemorrhagic diseases.\n\n- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===\nVirtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's \"terrain\" and any associated medications.\n\n==== 1. Digestive side effects ====\n- frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)\n\n- gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.\n\n- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).\n\nRisk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs\n\n- '''Elderly subject''': age > 65.\n\n- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage or Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\n- Severe co-morbidities.\n\n- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.\n\n- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n- active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis\n<br />\n\n==== 2.    Renal complications ====\n- Acute functional renal failure: especially in elderly patients or those suffering from hypovolaemia.\n\nThe risk factors are :\n\n- treatment with diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists;\n\n- dehydration ;\n\n- dehydrated diet ;\n\n- heart failure.\n\n- High blood pressure due to fluid retention\n\n- Chronic renal failure (chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy)\n<br />\n\n==== 3.    Cardiovascular complications ====\n- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.\n\n- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.\n\n- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n<br />\n\n==== 4.    Allergic complications ====\n- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)\n\n- Bronchospasm\n<br />\n\n==== 5.    Gynaecological and obstetric complications ====\n- Tocolytic activity\n\n- Foetus: premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal failure from the sixth month of pregnancy.\n\n- Reduced fertility\n<br />\n\n==== 6.    Other undesirable effects ====\n- Neurosensory disorders (headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, etc.).\n\n- Cytopenias\n\n- Hepatitis\n\n\n=== '''Precautions for use''' ===\n1.    Personalised assessment of the benefit/risk ratio (taking into account the indication, the patient's condition, co-morbidities and current medication).\n\n2.    Lowest possible dosage (dose-dependent adverse effects) and principles of multimodal analgesia for dose reduction\n\n3.    Prescription as short as possible.\n\n4.    Consider alternatives (paracetamol, corticosteroids), especially in elderly patients or those at risk.\n\n5.    In adolescents, NSAIDs intended for adults can be used from the age of 15.\n\nIn children > 3 to 4 years: ibuprofen and tiaprofenic acid, dose adapted to weight.\n\nIn infants: aspirin, dose to be adapted to weight, avoid if viral infection (flu, chickenpox).\n\n6.    If digestive risk factor: co-prescription of a half-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI).\n\n7.    If ''cardiovascular history'' or cardiovascular risk factors :\n\n- if you have a history of ischaemic heart disease, arterial disease of the lower limbs, a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or congestive heart failure:\n\n- contraindication to coxibs and diclofenac,\n\n- and non-selective NSAIDs not recommended;\n\n- if cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking): NSAIDs prescribed cautiously, only if necessary, with monitoring;\n\n- for patients on antiplatelet therapy :\n\n- the prescription of an NSAID should be avoided,\n\n- if necessary, should not lead to discontinuation of the antiaggregant.\n\n8.    The prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of ''renal insufficiency'', including with topical cutaneous forms.\n\n9.    Avoid NSAIDs in the acute phase of a viral or bacterial infection.\n\n10.

Reasoning when faced with a headache=\n- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.\n\n- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)\n\n- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?\n\n- '''Other features:'''\n\n- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)\n\n- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days\n\n- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)\n\n- Triggering and aggravating factors\n\n- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)\n\n- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated\n\n- '''Context of occurrence:'''\n\n- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors\n\n- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?\n\n- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)\n\n- '''Associated signs:'''\n\n- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]\n\n- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia\n\n- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]\n\n- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles\n\n- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]\n\n- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses\n\n- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month\n\n=4.

The higher the number of CAG triplets, the earlier and more severe the onset of the disease.\n\nClinical signs include abnormal movements, psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment.\n\nThe abnormal movements are primarily chorea, which spreads progressively and can affect the hands, feet, face and trunk. As the disease progresses, dystonic abnormal movements and a parkinsonian syndrome may be encountered.\n\nPsychiatric disorders often involving mood (sad mood, moral pain) and/or behaviour initially correspond to a change in personality, disinhibition, depression, [[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]], sometimes a suicide attempt or psychosis ([[Delusional ideas SD-124|delusional ideas]], rare [[Hallucinations SD-122|hallucinations]]).\n\nAssociated with this is a subcortical-frontal [[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|cognitive decline]] with a dysexecutive syndrome progressing to dementia. [Apathy SD-117|Apathy]] (lack of interest and motivation) and anosognosia are frequent.\n\nThere is usually a family history. There are sporadic forms, which can be misleading in cases of early death of one of the parents (censorship), false paternity or anticipation.\n\nThis condition involves the [[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]] and the [[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]]. The patient inevitably dies, with progressive [[Loss of autonomy SD-031|loss of autonomy]], a [[Situation of disability SD-345|situation of disability]], grabatisation, dementia with speech and swallowing disorders.
