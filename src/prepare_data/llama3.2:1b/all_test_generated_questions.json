Reasoning when faced with a headache=\n- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.\n\n- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.\n\n- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).\n\n=3.      Interrogation=\n- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:\n\n- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?\n\n- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?\n\n- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)\n\n- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?\n\n- '''Other features:'''\n\n- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)\n\n- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days\n\n- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)\n\n- Triggering and aggravating factors\n\n- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)\n\n- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated\n\n- '''Context of occurrence:'''\n\n- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors\n\n- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?\n\n- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)\n\n- '''Associated signs:'''\n\n- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]\n\n- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia\n\n- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]\n\n- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles\n\n- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]\n\n- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses\n\n- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month\n\n=4.      Physical examination=\n- To look for abnormalities that could guide further investigations.\n\n- Normal in primary headaches (except dysautonomic signs of a facial vascular attack)\n\n- General: blood pressure, temperature (beware of taking antipyretics, which can mask a fever), heart auscultation and skin examination (purpura).\n\n- '''Neurological:''' consciousness, meningeal syndrome (stiff neck), focal deficit, particularly cerebellar syndrome (ataxia may go unnoticed in a patient lying down and vomiting).\n\n- '''Neuro-ophthalmological''': visual field (homonymous lateral hemianopia), oculomotor paralysis (III or VI?), pupillary asymmetry (myosis/mydriasis), [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], (\u00b1 papilledema on fundus).\n\n- Local: inspection/palpation of skull, temporal arteries (if > 50 years old), eyeballs, ears, scalp (shingles), temporomandibular joints, neck.\n\n- ''Postural character'': assess the intensity of the headache in the standing position and then in the lying position.\n\n- Infant: fontanel (bulging?), cranial perimeter (increased?).\n\n=5.      Determination of acute or chronic nature=\n([[Chronic pain SD-035|chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]]; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]])\n\n- '''Any acute headache (in the sense of recent and unusual)''' is '''secondary''' until proven otherwise and requires urgent investigations.

This infection is rapidly associated with an intra-uterine infection (chorioamniotitis).\n\nIt is estimated that this pathogen is responsible for around 1% of bacterial meningitis in newborns and less than 0.15% of perinatal mortality. After E. coli K1 and SGB, L. monocytogenes remains the 3rd most common cause of neonatal meningitis. The seriousness of listeriosis is therefore due to the bacterium's tropism for the placenta and the central nervous system.\n\nThe infection manifests itself from birth with cyanosis, apnoea, respiratory distress and consciousness disorders. In these severe forms, which progress over several days, the mortality rate is high (50-75%). In almost 95% of cases, the disease is purulent meningitis with acute fever in children and adults, insomnia, irritability and disturbed consciousness.",

The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, the infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy, or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or in the family.\n\nThe risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately :\n\n- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labour ;\n\n- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding the work ;\n\n- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions ;\n\n- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes.\n\nThe risk is therefore minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes, but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of cases of neonatal herpes are ultimately observed in this situation. This is because :\n\n- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes;\n\n- but 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently: genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognised.\n\nVHB\n\nOne per cent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:\n\n- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test);( if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended.\n\n- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies[VFC(2] .\n\n- In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated.\n\nTransmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.     \n\nSero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended and the neonatologist should be informed.\n\n'''HIV'''\n\nMother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.\n\nVertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:\n\n- pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the foetus via the placenta.\n\n- intrapartum (infection during childbirth)\n\n- post-partum (via breast-feeding). 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth.\n\nTransmission can be influenced by several factors:\n\n- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load and low CD4 lymphocyte levels;\n\n- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery and intra-uterine infection (chorioamniotitis);\n\n- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries ;\n\n- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection.\n\n'''VZV'''\n\nTransmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes you to the risk of\n\n- ''Embryofetopathy'': the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation: amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy.\n\n- Shingles'' in the 1<sup>rst</sup> year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and > 3 weeks of childbirth)\n\n- '''Varicella neonatorum''': for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. '''93. [[Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) SD-093|Vesicles, vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal)]]'''''\n\n- In the case of maternal varicella, there is still a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

There are risks for the foetus and/or newborn baby if it has the corresponding antigen. This is the leading cause of foetal anaemia.\n\n\nThe patient may become immune during pregnancy as a result of foetomaternal haemorrhage (passage of \"incompatible\" foetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation).\n\n\nThe most frequent and serious alloimmunisations with foetal and neonatal consequences are anti-D (Rh1), c (Rh4) or Kell. Other blood group antigens may be involved much more rarely and with a lower risk (anti-E).\n\n\nThis situation can lead to foetal anaemia in cases of foetal-maternal blood incompatibility. If the foetus has the erythrocyte antigen corresponding to the maternal antibody, the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta may be responsible for haemolysis and therefore foetal anaemia. In the case of severe anaemia, this can lead to hydrops (effusion of foetal serosa) and foetal death.\n\n'''312. [[Prevention of foetal risks SD-312|Prevention of foetal risks]]''''",

Three types of CI are classically distinguished:\n\n\u00d8 ''Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF \u226440%)'' caused by failure of myocardial contraction.\n\n\u00d8 ''Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%'' generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.\n\n\u00d8 '''Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction LVEF \u226550%.'''

There is no treatment to shorten auras ([[Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249|prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]; [[Prescribe analgesics SD-250|prescribe analgesics]]).\n\no ''Mild onset seizure'': paracetamol.\n\no ''Mild attacks (if paracetamol fails) and moderate to severe attacks'': an NSAID and a triptan (specific migraine medication) on the same prescription, with advice not to exceed ''2 days a week'' or 8 days a month.\n\no Effectiveness to be assessed after 3 attacks\n\n- ''Background treatment'': to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures in eligible patients. These treatments will not eliminate the attacks. The objectives are to reduce the number of headache days per month by 50% in the case of episodic migraine and by 30% in the case of chronic migraine.\n\no Non-specific treatments (beta-blockers, tricyclics, anti-epileptic migraine drugs)\n\no Slow onset of treatment and assessment of efficacy after 3 months\n\no If effective, continue for 6 to 12 months, then reduce slowly and gradually to stop\n\no Specific treatments for severe migraines (8 or more attack days/month) after failure of at least 2 oral treatments: antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway (not reimbursed)\n\n- '''If chronic migraine with drug abuse:'''\n\no Prescribe background medication\n\no Advise the patient to wean off the over-used medication on an outpatient basis.\n\no Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, with advice to aim for 8 days of treatment per month.\n\n- '''For all migraines affecting quality of life:''' non-medicinal treatments (combined or not with medicinal treatments): physical exercise, physiotherapy and/or psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioural therapy, relaxation) are proposed as a complement to medicinal treatment.\n\n\n'''<u>2. General principles of the treatment of tension-type headache</u>''''\n\n- '''Information''': explain to the patient that a state of psychological tension can lead to a headache through excessive muscular tension.\n\n- '''Crisis treatment''': paracetamol, aspirin or NSAID, '''not to exceed 2 days per week'' or 8 days per month. Opiates should be avoided at all costs.\n\n- Background treatment'': indicated in cases of frequent or chronic tension-type headache, this is essentially based on amitriptyline, to be increased very gradually up to the maximum tolerated (10 to 50 mg). Other molecules are also used (venlafaxine, gabapentin, duloxetine).\n\n- '''Withdrawal''' in the event of abuse of analgesics or NSAIDs.\n\n- '''Non-medicinal treatment''': healthy lifestyle, sedentary lifestyle, physiotherapy, relaxation and cognitive and behavioural therapies for stress management.\n\n'''<u>3.

ENT, dental and ophthalmological examinations are unnecessary for typical attacks;\n\n- Assess the socio-professional and psychological impact.\n\n- '''General measures''': Alcohol consumption should be avoided. Sleep schedules should be regular, avoiding naps. Smoking cessation is encouraged (but does not lead to recovery).\n\n- There are two types of treatment.\n\n- Crisis treatments\" are taken during each crisis to relieve the headache. They do not prevent a new attack from occurring. Two crisis treatments are effective:\n\no Subcutaneous sumatriptan injection (sumatriptan Sun\u00ae, 6 mg/mL) relieves pain in 3 to 15 minutes. The maximum dose is 2 injections per day. Patients can take it every day. Sumatriptan spray is sometimes effective.\n\no \"Oxygen therapy\" (12 to 15 L/min for 15 to 20 minutes) using a high-flow face mask is effective and reimbursed. It can only be prescribed by a neurologist, ENT specialist or in an algology centre.\n\n- Background treatments'' are useful in some patients to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. These treatments will not make the attacks disappear for good.\n\no ''Verapamil'': first line (120 mg, twice a day) after an ECG to check there are no contraindications. Higher doses are sometimes used.\n\n- '''Other: corticosteroid therapy (if very frequent attacks),''' lithium carbonate (reserved for chronic forms) and '''surgical treatments''' (reserved for drug-resistant chronic forms).\n\n'''<u>4. General principles of the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia</u>''''\n\n- '''Drug treatment''' :\n\no carbamazepine (400 to 1,600 mg/d), gradually increased, taken 2 or 3 times a day, 1/2 hour before meals. Side effects are frequent in elderly patients (drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia).\n\no In the event of intolerance, oxcarbamazepine may be used. Baclofen may be used alone or in combination with carbamazepine. Other drugs are sometimes used (lamotrigine, gabapentin).\n\no This drug treatment is the same whether the neuralgia is classic, secondary (e.g. to MS) or idiopathic (with electrical discharges).\n\n- '''Surgical treatments:''' Surgical treatment is offered in cases where drug therapy has failed.\n\no Destruction of the trigeminal tract by various techniques: gamma-knife radiosurgery on the emergence of the trigeminal ganglion; thermocoagulation or balloon compression of Gasser's ganglion.\n\no Surgery to decompress a vascular-nervous impingement: this requires demonstration of a vascular-nervous impingement (strict MRI criteria).\n\n- '''Painful trigeminal neuropathy (including postherpetic pain)''' It is treated in the same way as other focal neuropathic pain, combining local and general treatment (see specific item).

(</nowiki>[[Prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249|prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]; [[Prescribing analgesics SD-250|prescribing analgesics]])\n\n- Paracetamol, often used as a self-medication, is only effective for mild to moderate attacks.\n\n- NSAIDs: Ibuprofen and ketoprofen have marketing authorisation for the treatment of migraine attacks. Naproxen, diclofenac and indometacin have also been shown to be effective.\n\n- Triptans: Specific anti-migraine drugs. These serotonin 5HT1B/1D receptor agonists are vasoconstrictors and are contraindicated in patients with a history of vascular disease. The dosage is one unit at the start of an attack, to be repeated in the event of a recurrence (maximum 2 per day).\n\n- '''Metoclopramide''': relieves digestive problems in cases of nausea/vomiting.\n\n- Do not prescribe opiates because of the risk of drug abuse, addiction and increased digestive problems. Avoid combined analgesics (caffeine) as they increase the risk of drug abuse.  \n\n'''Recommended treatments for migraine attacks.'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|'''Undesirable effects'''\n|'''Main'''\n\n'''contraindications'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | '''Aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs'''\n|-\n|<nowiki>- Aspirin 1000 mg</nowiki>\n\n- Acetylsalicylic acid 900 mg + metoclopramide 10 mg (Migpriv\u00ae)\n\n- Ibuprofen 400 mg\n\n- Ketoprofen 75-150 mg (max 200 mg/d)\n<br />\n|Digestive disorders, haemorrhage\n\nAllergy or asthma triggered by aspirin or NSAIDs\n|Peptic ulcer disease in progress\n\nPregnancy > 24 SA\n\nMetoclopramide: <12 years, history of neuroleptic dyskinesia\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |'''Triptans: maximum 2 units/d''''\n|-\n|Almotriptan (12.5 mg cp)\n\nEletriptan (cp 20 or 40 mg)\n\nFrovatriptan (cp 2.5 mg)\n\nNaratriptan (cp 2.5mg)\n\nRizatriptan (cp 5 or 10 mg; orodispersible 10 mg)\n\nSumatriptan (cp 50 mg, nasal spray 20 and 10 mg, SC injection [not reimbursed])\n\nZolmitriptan (2.5 mg tablet; orodispersible tablet)\n|Nausea, dizziness, drowsiness\n\nHeaviness, pain or pressure in the chest, neck or limbs\n\nPalpitations, tachycardia\n\n\nCoronary spasm (exceptional)\n|Coronary artery disease, ischaemic arterial disease, uncontrolled hypertension\n\nStroke or TIA\n<br />\n|}\n\n- '''Prescription and advice''' [[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|(writing a prescription/medical letter]]; [[Explaining a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explaining a treatment to the patient]])\n\no Advise taking it \"early\", within one hour of the onset of the mild to moderate headache, for no more than 8 days a month (to prevent drug abuse).\n\no ''If paracetamol fails, prescribe a triptan and an NSAID on the same prescription'', depending on the drugs already tried and the patient's preferences, and explain the ''strategy''.\n\n\u00a7 Mild crisis'': take the NSAID then the triplan if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.\n\n\u00a7 '''Moderate crisis''' '''or severe crisis''': take triptan then NSAID if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.\n\n\u00a7 Seizure with aura: take the NSAID as soon as the aura starts and the triptan as soon as the headache starts.\n\no Prescribe a combination of paracetamol and metoclopramide to patients with a contraindication to or intolerance of NSAIDs, aspirin and triptans.\n\no Prescribe metoclopramide (oral, rectal or injectable) for digestive disorders\n\n- '''Follow-up and optimisation of crisis treatment (after at least 3 crises)''' '''<u>2.  Background treatment of migraine</u>'''\n\n- '''Traditional oral treatments:''' several have proven efficacy in episodic migraine, with a high level of evidence (amitriptyline, flunarizine, metoprolol, pizotifen, propranolol, topiramate and sodium valproate) or a lower level of evidence (lisinopril, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, timolol, oxetorone, venlafaxine). Only topiramate has proven efficacy in the prevention of chronic migraine.\n\n- Antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway'': three anti-CGRP antibodies injected SC have marketing authorisation in France for the prophylaxis of migraine with at least 8 migraine days per month and failure of at least 2 prior disease-modifying treatments. They can only be prescribed by a neurologist. In 2021, these costly treatments were not yet reimbursed.\n\n- Botulinum toxin: proven effective in chronic migraine, but not episodic migraine. Approved after failure of at least two disease-modifying treatments, as an alternative to anti-CGRP antibodies. It will be administered in hospital only.\n\n\n- '''Indication for background treatment:''' Determined on the basis of patient preferences, the diary, any criteria for severe migraine and chronic migraine, and the impact assessed using the HIT-6 and HAD scales. It is ''recommended to initiate a background treatment'' in patients with frequent and/or disabling attacks, and in all patients.\n\no Using seizure medication 8 days or more per month for > 3 months\n\no Having severe migraine according to French definition criteria\n\no Having chronic migraine according to ICHD-3 criteria\n\no With a HIT-6 score of 60 or more\n\no Having disabling migraine attacks despite optimised crisis treatment\n\n\n- '''Objectives of background treatment to be explained to the patient'''\n\no The aim is to reduce monthly headache days by 50% in episodic migraine and 30% in chronic migraine.\n\no Efficacy is assessed during the 3rd month of treatment.\n\no Failure of disease-modifying therapy may be due to ineffectiveness and/or intolerance.\n\n\n- '''Prescription of the first background treatment:''' Start at a low dose and gradually increase to reach the optimal daily dose, taking into account the side-effects.\n\no Explain that compliance is vital and encourage once-daily dosing if possible.\n\no ''Episodic migraine'': ''propranolol'' or ''metoprolol'' as first-line treatment and where beta-blockers, amitriptyline, candesartan or topiramate are contraindicated.\n\no ''Chronic migraine: topiramate'' as first-line treatment, specialist advice is recommended.\n\no ''Chronic migraine'' with a ''drug-induced headache''.\n\n\u00a7 Prescribe a first-line background treatment\n\n\u00a7 Advise the patient to wean off the over-used medication on an outpatient basis.\n\n\u00a7 Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, with advice to aim for 8 days of treatment per month.\n\n- '''Assessment and monitoring of background treatment:'''\n\no Seizure diary and HIT-6 scale to assess the effectiveness of background treatment, which must be taken regularly for 3 months before being evaluated.\n\no If effective, it is continued for 6 to 18 months.\n\no If this fails, a new treatment should be tried. The choice of drug depends on the patient's condition, co-morbidity and the severity of the migraine, taking into account the benefit/risk balance.\n\no ''After failure of two disease-modifying treatments'', specialist advice is recommended (neurologist).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"4\" |'''Basic first-line migraine treatments'''\n|-\n|'''Molecule'''\n\n'''(therapeutic class)'''\n|'''Daily dose'''\n\n'''Minimal-Maximal'''\n\n'''(Average)'''\n|'''Main adverse reactions'''\n|'''Main contraindications'''\n|-\n|'''Amitriptyline'''\n\n'''(anti'''\n\n'''tricyclic depressant)'''\n|10-100 mg (25 mg)\n\nOne at dinner\n|Dry mouth, drowsiness, weight gain\n|Absent: glaucoma, prostate adenoma\n\nRelative: obesity\n|-\n|Propranolol\n\n'''(beta-blocker)''''\n|20-240 mg (80 mg)\n\nTaken twice a day or once in the morning (LP form).\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Frequent: asthenia, exercise intolerance\n\nRare: depression\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Absolute: asthma, heart failure, atrioventricular block, bradycardia\n\nPrecaution: depression\n|-\n|Metoprolol\n\n'''(beta-blocker)''''\n|50-200 mg (100 mg)\n\nOne dose in the morning (LP form)\n|-\n|Candesartan\n\n'''(angiotensin II receptor antagonist)''''\n<br />\n|8-32 mg (16 mg)\n\nOne or two intakes/day\n|Hypotension\n|Absolute: heart failure, renal artery stenosis, renal insufficiency, pregnancy\n\nRelative: hypotension\n|-\n|Topiramate\n\n'''(antiepilep-''''\n\n'''tique)'''\n|50-200 mg (100 mg)\n\nOne or two doses/day\n|Frequent: paresthesias, weight loss, cognitive problems (lack of words), depression\n\nRare: renal lithiasis, acute myopia with acute angle glaucoma\n|Abnormal: Hypersensitivity, pregnancy, glaucoma, metformin use, hepatic or renal insufficiency, renal lithiasis.\n\nRelative: depression, suicidal ideation\n|}\n- '''Non-drug background treatment: '''\n\no '''Physical exercise''''\n\no '''Acupuncture''''\n\no '''Psycho-behavioural treatments'''\n\n\n'''<u>3.

Various elements of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with gout: obesity with increased abdominal circumference ('>'' 94 cm in European men and 88 cm in women), arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia with reduced HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia.\n\nPatients with gout should therefore be considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, which explains the excess mortality observed!\n\nGout occurring before the age of 35 is possible in 10-15% of cases. It should be investigated for a genetic origin with abnormalities in the genes encoding uric acid transporters in the renal tubules (''URAT1'', ''ABCG2'').\n\n\n- secondary to :\n\n- chronic renal failure, which reduces uric acid excretion;\n\n- several years' use of a drug that reduces urinary uric acid excretion, particularly thiazide diuretics, furosemide or etacrynic acid, acetazolamide, but also cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin or certain anti-tuberculosis drugs (ethambutol and pyrazinamide).",

The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether or not the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated: stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium (loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule). PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol (an active metabolite of vitamin D) increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.\n*Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone.\n*Hypocalcaemia therefore results :\n**either an increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation),\n**or a reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption).",

The patient's symptoms (\"designated patient\", \"symptom carrier\") are included in this systemic dynamic, which needs to be rebalanced by re-establishing more functional communication and/or interrelationships.\n\n- Therapeutic education: therapeutic patient education \"aims to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as well as possible with a chronic disease.

The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.\n*The quantity of H<sup>+</sup> entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> \u21d4 H2CO3 \u21d4 CO2 + H2O\n*This buffer system is said to be \"open\" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.\n*Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH<sub>blood</sub> = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/[H2CO3]) = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/0.03 PC02)\n*The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO2 and HCO3<sup>-</sup> is modified, i.e. :\n**when there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO3<sup>-</sup> ions. This is known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis,\n**or when there is a primary change in PCO2. This is known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.\n\nB.    The main sources of acid\n\n*There are two main sources of acid:\n**Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O2, water and CO2 (oxidative metabolism). The CO2 generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO2 leads to respiratory acidosis.\n**Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H2SO4 for sulphur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H2P04 for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.\n\nC.    Role of the lung in acid-base balance\n\n*By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO2 of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO2 through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO2 by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.\n*Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO2 and pCO2, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.\n\nD.    Role of the kidney in acid-base balance\n\n*Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.\n*Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",

The increase in intracellular volume is due to a transfer of water from the extracellular sector to the intracellular sector as a result of plasma hypo-osmolality. Hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality is explained by a relative water content higher than the sodium stock, which may be normal (pure HIC), increased (HIC + HEC = global hyperhydration) or decreased (HIC + DEC).\n*Indications for prescribing a natraemia:\n**Neurological or digestive symptoms (see clinical signs),\n**monitoring of diuretic treatment,\n**pulmonary, cerebral or endocrine pathologies associated with hyponatraemia,\n**conditions responsible for hyponatremia: heart failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.",

Relevance is also judged by the clinical significance of the endpoint. Criteria such as mortality, quality of life, occurrence of complications, etc. are of significant clinical relevance, but it is not always feasible to collect the most clinically relevant criterion. In such cases, a \"surrogate endpoint\" is used (for example, cholesterol levels as a surrogate for cardiovascular mortality) to improve feasibility, at the cost of reduced clinical relevance. In some cases, considering only one type of event is not relevant to the question posed, and a \"composite criterion\" (composed of several events, the occurrence of one or other of which marks the positivity of the composite criterion) is used. For example, \"death OR stroke OR myocardial infarction\". Note that in the vast majority of cases, it is recommended to favour one and only one primary endpoint.\n* <u>Optionally</u>: '''secondary endpoints''' defined in order to support the primary endpoint, or to explore various aspects of the pathology and thus evaluate the secondary objectives.\n* <u>For analytical or experimental studies</u>:\n** one or more '''exposure factors''' (risk factors, experimental intervention, cf. [[Risk factor, etiological factor, prognostic factor, health determinants, exposure factor 2C-020-DE-A04]]), the relevance of which is assessed by adequacy with the primary objective and any secondary objectives.\n** adjustment variables\", the relevance of which is assessed by identifying all the factors which could theoretically (on the basis of data in the literature) confound the link between the exposure factor and the endpoint (see [[Understanding the concept and role of adjustment. Knowing how to interpret and read an adjusted result 2C-020-DE-B11]])\n* <u>For studies evaluating the performance of diagnostic or screening test(s)</u>: the result of the '''test(s) to be evaluated''' (the result of the reference test being the primary endpoint)\n* <u>For all studies</u>: the '''characteristics of the individuals making it possible to describe the sample'' included and thus to judge its representativeness and potential selection biases.",

This is a non-random method (widely used by survey institutes), which means that the probability of each individual belonging to the sample is unknown, which prevents the variance from being estimated correctly and therefore the precision of the estimates.\n*Sample of convenience'': individuals are included in the study for practical reasons of accessibility, cost, logistics, etc. This method should be avoided because it has the effect of increasing the probability of each individual belonging to the sample.

Penalising abortion was intended to protect the country's demography. In 1972, Marie-Claire, a young woman of 17, went on trial for having had an abortion following a rape. This was the Bobigny trial. The young woman was defended by Gis\u00e8le Halimi, who won the case. The \"offence of abortion\" no longer existed. It was only 3 years later that Simone Veil, then Minister for Health, had the law decriminalising abortion passed on 17 January 1975. In 1975, abortion was authorised up to the twelfth week of amenorrhoea and parental authorisation was required for minors. The first abortion centres were opened in 1979. It was not until 2001 that abortion was authorised up to 14 weeks of amenorrhoea. Since March 2022, abortion has been authorised up to 16 weeks' amenorrhoea.",

These have redefined the way in which we see and conceive of illnesses, but also the way in which we apprehend our bodies. As an artefact between carer and patient, between observer and observed, they redefine the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body, and transform the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images and data that can be reductionist.\n\nThe resulting observation is accompanied by its own terminology, which can also lead to distancing and create a gap between what is experienced by the patient (their subjective experience) and the way in which medicine objectifies their body.\n\nWhen it comes to the human body, the human sciences most often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The first is simply a body among bodies, impersonal, governed by natural laws, devoid of specifically human characteristics, an object of action or contemplation. The second, the subject-body, designates both the subjective body, as the psychophysiological substratum of the individual experience of the body, and the subject's body, as the dimension of corporeity on which the action of the human subject is exercised. In the world of healthcare, this distinction makes it possible to relativise and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without falling into the easy reductionism that would consist of directing the carer's attention to a single aspect of physicality. The body cannot be reduced to a battery of organs, or to a set of figures or laboratory images, or to the patient's account of his or her own life.",

DCs are usually very effective in the short term against AD flare-ups. Long-term efficacy studies are very rare. DCs are classified according to their potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak activity) and their galenic form (cream, ointment, lotion and gel).\n\n\n'''The choice of a DC depends on four criteria: age, location of lesions, extent to be treated and oozing nature of lesions.'''\n\n\n<u>choice of galenical</u>:\n\n-ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas\n\n-cream for oozing areas, folds and large skin surfaces\n\n-lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children)\n\n- scalp gel (rarely used in children)\n\n<u>The choice of activity level</u>\n\n-Very strong DCs are contraindicated on infants and young children, and on the face, folds and seat.\n\nHigh-activity CDs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated in children on lichenified lesions, on the extremities and on lesions resistant to moderate-activity CDs.      \n\nModerate-activity CDs are used on the face and body of infants and children.\n\nlow-activity CDs are of no interest because they have little or no efficacy.\n\nnumber of applications per day\n\nA single application per day is just as effective as several applications, and makes it easier to adhere to treatment.  \n\n<u>quantity to be applied</u>\n\nThere is no maximum quantity recommended during the initial treatment.\n\nThe amount required to maintain remission during maintenance treatment should not normally exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity CD for children and 60 g/month of high-activity CD for adults.\n\nDuring the maintenance period, it has been shown in children and adults that the systematic use of a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on the skin areas usually affected for 4 months reduced the number of flare-ups without side-effects. This method of using DCs (pro-active treatment) is particularly suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups that recur rapidly when DCs are stopped.\n<br />\n\n=== 3) Emollients ===\nEmollients improve the functional signs of skin dryness and some of them temporarily restore the skin's barrier function.\n\nThe use of emollients is recommended by professional agreement from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as a maintenance treatment throughout the duration of AD, regardless of its severity.\n\nprecautions for use:\n\ninterruption for a few days during a highly inflammatory flare-up (frequently poor tolerance)\n\n-Galenics to be adapted to the patient's preferences\n\nFragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitisation. ATTENTION: emollients are not reimbursed by the health insurance scheme, with the exception of atopiclair\u00ae, generics of dexeryl\u00a9 (reimbursable at 15%) and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.\n<br />\n\n=== 4) Therapeutic education ===\nThe aim of therapeutic education is to teach patients how to live optimally with a chronic disease. It is a process integrated into care, adapted to the patient's needs, which includes a range of information and learning techniques provided by one or more carers (doctors, nurses, psychologists, .....) during programmes involving consultation(s) and/or meetings in small groups. The aim is to help patients and/or their families become more independent, to encourage them to adhere to treatment and to combat corticophobia, which is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\nOther treatments :\n\noral antihistamines (anti-H1): no proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase apart from an old study / interest in hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during the flare-up period in young children with sleep disorders\n\n\n-Topical immunomodulator: tacrolimus (in France) - indicated for flare-ups of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (facial lesions++).\n\n\n-Systemic treatments: treatment of severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated (risk of rebound on discontinuation).  ",

CCHD is the result of an abnormality in the antenatal development of the hip, leading to instability of the joint or even dislocation at birth.  The risk factors for LCH are :  - family history of 1st degree CHL; - breech presentation whatever the mode of delivery; - limitation of unilateral or bilateral hip abduction; - congenital asymmetric pelvis;\n\n- associated postural abnormalities ('genu recurvatum', torticollis).\n\nScreening consists of a clinical examination at birth and then at each consultation until walking age and looks for :\n\n- asymmetry of the folds and lengths of the lower limbs;\n\n- abduction limitation <60\u00b0;\n\n- instability of the hip using the Barlow manoeuvre, which reveals a protrusion in the case of a \"dislocatable hip\" or \"reducible dislocated hip\". In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry.\n\nIf there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for LCH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed. After 4 months, the reference examination is a pelvic X-ray.\n\n# '''Hearing screening (Hearing loss/deafness)''' 5% of children under the age of 6 have a hearing defect. Congenital CMV infection is the leading cause of congenital deafness Risk factors for congenital deafness are :  - family history; - birth before 32 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <1800g; - perinatal asphyxia; - hyperbilirubinaemia >350 \u00b5mol/L; - neurological disorders; - malformation of the face and neck; - foetopathy (CMV, rubella, herpes, toxoplasmosis); - ototoxic treatment Screening is carried out systematically in maternity wards using induced acoustic emission tests (EAPT). If the examination is abnormal on two occasions, the newborn is referred to an ENT specialist for a check-up. If abnormalities are confirmed on examination, an audiogram and auditory evoked potentials will be carried out in a specialist centre.\n# '''Visual screening''' The risk factors for visual problems are :  - prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation; - neurological disorders; - deafness; - chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, etc.); - craniostenosis, craniofacial dysostoses; - embryo-fetopathies (toxoplasmosis); - in utero exposure to cocaine, alcohol; - family history of hereditary ophthalmological disease (congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, etc.).  Screening is based on clinical examination: - eyelids: ptosis, epicanthus, angioma; - eyeballs: microphthalmia, buphthalmia; - conjunctivae: redness, tearing; - corneas: symmetry of corneal reflections, corneal opacity; - pupils: leukocoria (retinoblastoma, cataract), aniscoria (neuroblastoma); - iris.  The examination assesses ocular pursuit with a target and looks for the presence of nystagmus.\n\nIntermittent and alternating strabismus may indicate delayed acquisition of oculomotricity up to the age of 3 months. Permanent or divergent strabismus, whatever the age, or present after the age of 3 months, should be considered pathological ('''[[Child Strabismus SD-157|Strabismus]]'')''.",

It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).\n\nThere are two pathophysiological phases:\n\n#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to na\u00efve LTCD8+. The na\u00efve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.\n#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification.jpg|vignette|Figure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity in the Gel and Coombs classification]]\n\n\nFigure 1: Type IV delayed hypersensitivity according to the Gel and Coombs classification.\n\nModel of allergic contact eczema.\n\nAsymptomatic sensitisation phase (production of allergen-specific T lymphocytes on first contact)\n\nReveal phase on new contact (clinical eczema)",

Do not confuse ''thermal medicine'' with ''hydrotherapy'' (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or ''thalassotherapy'' (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognised nor reimbursed by the Health Insurance) or ''Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine''.\n\n==Waters used in Thermal Medicine ==\nThey are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The \"thermality\" separates \"cold\" waters (8 to 15\u00b0C, mainly for diuresis cures), \"mesothermal\" waters (25 to 34\u00b0C, for prolonged baths) and \"hyperthermal\" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The \"mineralisation\" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as :\n\n#SULPHUR: H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the \"Pyrenean\" type or calcic;\n#SULPHATE: urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium;\n#SODIQUE CHLORIDES: rich in sodium\n#GAS BARBONATES: sodium or calcium;\n#WITH A RARE ELEMENT: arsenic, iron, copper, selenium;\n#LOW MINERAL content: (trace metals).\n\nNB: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (\"griffon\") and to carry out the treatment on site.\n\nOther thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S) and mud (peloids).\n\n=='''Thermal techniques with 3 main types of cures <small>([[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explain a treatment to the patient]])</small>'''==\n\n#Internal hydrotherapy based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 litres per day) are used for digestive, urinary or metabolic disorders.\n#Contact\" cures: application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.\n#''External hydrotherapy'' uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional or general, of varying temperature, pressure and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.\n\nThe other thermal techniques are ''functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine'' (physiotherapy, postural drainage and respiratory re-education) and also health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place. '''([[Prescription of a rehabilitation SDD-247|Prescription of a rehabilitation]])''''\n\n== '''Spa resorts in France'''==\n'''Around a hundred spa resorts in France:''' firstly in Occitanie (200,000 spa visitors/year), then in Nouvelle Aquitaine (150,000 spa visitors/year) and Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes (130,000 spa visitors/year). The 3 main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL) and Gr\u00e9oux (RH, VR).\n\n==Indications for spa treatment ==\nChronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialisation in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters). There are 12 therapeutic orientations for spas recognised by the French social security system, and spas may have 2 (exceptionally 3) therapeutic orientations.\n\n#RH : Rheumatology and sequelae of osteo-articular trauma ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]])''''\n#Respiratory tract diseases (ENT or pneumology)\n#MCA : Cardio-Arterial Diseases\n#AU : Diseases of the Urinary System and Metabolic Diseases\n#AD: Diseases of the Digestive System and Metabolic Diseases\n#PHL: Phlebology\n#GYN: Gynaecology\n#DER: Dermatology\n#AMB: Oral and lingual mucosal diseases\n#NEU : Neurology\n#PSY: Psychosomatic disorders\n#''TDE : Troubles du D\u00e9veloppement de l'Enfant'' [[Anomalie du d\u00e9veloppement psychomoteur SD-115|'''(Anomaly of psychomotor development)''']]\n\nNB: obsolete information is shown in italics.\n\nSince the early 2000s, under the aegis of the AFRETH (Association Fran\u00e7aise de REcherche THermale - French Association for Thermal Research), several high-quality clinical trials have been carried out, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of thermal medicine in its main indications. The most validated indications are rheumatology (osteoarthritis, chronic lumbago, inflammatory rheumatism outside flare-ups), followed by arteritis and psychiatry (generalised anxiety disorders).\n\n==Undesirable effects of spa treatments ==\nVery rare and often \"non-serious\": asthenia after a few days of treatment (\"spa crisis\"), complications of treatment techniques, etc. \n\n==Contraindications to spa treatments ==\nObvious non-indications such as infections, cancers, relapsing illnesses, recent cardiovascular diseases, immunodepression, etc.\n\n=='''How to prescribe a spa treatment?'''==\n'''([[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|Drafting a prescription/medical letter]])''''\n\nThe cure is prescribed by the attending physician on a special form to be sent to the Caisse d'AM with its 2 sections: prise en charge (completed by the prescribing physician) and d\u00e9claration de ressources (completed by the insured person). The doctor must specify (using the key letter) the main indication (and any secondary indications). A course of treatment lasts 3 weeks. Reimbursed at 65% by SS (100% reimbursed if ALD, occupational disease or work accident). Complementary medical practices (pharyngeal showers, Proetz displacement method in ENT, thermal gas injections for arteriopathy) are reimbursed at 70%.\n\nThe ''medical surveillance package'' includes 3 medical consultations: on arrival, in the middle and at the end of the cure. Only one cure per year is reimbursed by Social Security. You can renew your spa treatment every year.",

It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.\n\nIn non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).\n\nPrior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196\u00b0C.\n\n<br />\n\n*'''<u>Female fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n'''In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:'''\n\n*freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation.   As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196\u00b0C, or used in fertilisation for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.\n**However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:\n***it requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.\n***it induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g. hormone-dependent breast cancer).\n\n*Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro ''maturation''''''' of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured \"in vitro\" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen, or used for fertilisation with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n''If the'' ''patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to re-use them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient)''.\n\n''It should be noted that the fertilisation method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI''.\n\n*Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196\u00b0C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the \"reintroduction of the initial disease\" through the tumour cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).\n\nIn addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at \"resting\" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective''.\n\n''In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionising radiation on the ovary''.\n \n\n'''In prepubescent girls:'''\n\nOvarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.\n\n\n'''<u>Male fertility preservation techniques</u>''''\n\n*In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).\n*In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to \"in vitro\" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting and germ cell transplantation.\n\n<br />",

It can be carried out with sperm from a spouse ('''IAC'') or from a donor ('''IAD'').\n\nInsemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to obtain maturation of one to three follicles, or induction of ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders ([[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|Menstrual Cycle Disorders]]: anovulation or dysovulation).  \n\nPelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation. This is known as ovulation monitoring.\n\nOvulation is triggered by injection of recombinant hCG to synchronise ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition.\n\nThe day after the induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory, under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected (similar to the migration-survival test, see LISA sheet for item 38). The sperm preparation is inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.            \n\n*In Vitro Fertilisation''''' conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.\n\n<u>Ovarian stimulation</u> under supervision (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) by administration of high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked at the same time by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists.\n\nThese protocols require ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH and progesterone levels). The aim of this monitoring is to :\n\n*check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing),\n*choose the optimum day for ovulation induction,\n*identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g. ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g. insufficient ovarian response).\n\nOvulation is triggered when several follicles have reached a size greater than 16 mm by injection of either an hCG analogue (recombinant hCG) or a GnRH agonist.\n\n<u>Follicular puncture</u> (of the follicular fluid) is performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anaesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory where it is examined for cumulo-ovocyte complexes.\n\n<u>Sperm preparation</u> is carried out in the majority of cases using a '''sperm sample taken by masturbation'' on the day of the follicular puncture. However, it is also possible to use frozen sperm from a spouse or a third-party donor. It is also possible to use sperm taken surgically (either from testicular tissue (testicular biopsy) or from the liquid in the epididymis (epididymal puncture)) in cases of azoospermia (sperm which will then be used fresh or after freezing). Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinised urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation (into the bladder). The spermatozoa recovered are prepared according to the \"in vitro\" fertilisation technique envisaged.\n\n<u>Fertilisation</u> is either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).\n\n<u>Culture and embryo transfer</u>: after fertilisation of the oocytes by sperm, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on a number of factors.\n\nA pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.\n\n<u>Embryo freezing</u>: non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and then kept in storage tanks containing liquid nitrogen (-196\u00b0C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are first thawed and then transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.\n\n\nThe MPA can be :\n\n*intra-marital'' (using the gametes, oocytes and spermatozoa of both members of the couple)\n*or with the intervention of a ''third party donor'' (sperm donor, oocyte donor or a couple who have agreed to donate embryos frozen during a previous IVF procedure and for which the couple no longer have any parental plans).\n\nDouble gamete donation (oocytes and sperm) is possible (French Bioethics Act 2021).\n\nPGM can be carried out in the context of \"viral risk\" (HIV, hepatitis B and/or C) in centres approved for this activity. Finally, one of the techniques used in MAP is \"pre-implantation diagnosis\" (PGD), the aim of which is to diagnose genetic anomalies (genes, chromosomes) in embryonic cells. Only a few AMP centres are authorised to carry out PGD in France.\n\n<br />",

This means that people with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection. The incidence of prosthesis-related IE is estimated at around 5% at 5 years.\n\nEarly AEs (<1 year after implantation) result from peri-operative contamination (catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation, etc.). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).\n\nLate IEs (>1 year after implantation) originate from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are therefore those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).\n\n\nClinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. In addition, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.\n\nThe diagnostic strategy for ARs on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves (see item 152).\n\nAntibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.\n\nThe indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following being particularly favourable: the presence of clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, an uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, the presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by \"Staphylococcus Aureus\".\n\nThe prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends above all on clear information being given to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.\n\nTherapeutic education is essential, particularly with regard to signs that should prompt consultation (prolonged fever, AEG). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.\n\nDental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.\n\nThe antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure.

Ageing alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain remains ''under-estimated and under-treated'' and treatment must be ''individualised and adapted'' according to the patient's state of health (''co-morbidities and chronic treatments, state of emunctory functions).\n\n- Acute pain: certain acute pathologies that are usually painful in adults (myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, fractures) can be \"silent\" in the elderly, who often present late at the emergency department, consult and report their pain later than younger adults, with more complications that can be serious or even fatal.\n\n- Chronic pain: the prevalence is \"high\", affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions, with a variety of aetiologies (osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, iatrogenic, etc.).\n\n- Pain management is based on '''4 pillars:''' '''R'''ep\u00e9rage,''''E'''appraisal,''''T'''raitement and always Re-'''E'''appraisal of pain in order to judge the effectiveness of the approach adopted. It includes the care teams and/or the family.\n\n\n'''<u>Know the particularities of pain management in the elderly</u>''''\n\n\n'''Spotting'''\n\n- Some types of pain are predictable (pain during care, pressure sores, etc.), even if this is not specific to the elderly (see \"Prevalence and epidemiology\" section), while others are more difficult to anticipate (paroxysmal attacks of pain) or to identify.\n\n- You need to look for \"warning signs\" and have a pain reflex, especially if the behaviour is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming.\n\n- Any elderly person who expresses pain or behaviour suggestive of pain is indeed in pain. We need to apply the \"precautionary principle\" and fight against preconceived ideas, beliefs, fears and representations held by patients and those around them, such as \"It's normal to be in pain when you're old\".\n\n\n'''Evaluation'''\n\n- The patient will be correctly seated (environment, wearing of glasses, hearing aids and dental prostheses), with an empathetic and patient approach, a climate of trust and taking into account any cognitive or expressive difficulties.\n\n- A \"geriatric assessment\" (including depression and behaviour) is carried out in addition to identifying the components of the pain.\n\n- Self-assessment is carried out using a simple numerical or verbal scale rather than the VAS. In the event of failure, an observation of behaviours using a ''hetero-evaluation'' scale (Algoplus\u00ae, Doloplus\u00ae, ECPA\u00ae) is used, preferably in a team, and this evaluation is repeated regularly.\n\n\n'''Treatment'''\n\n- Ageing ''modifies the pharmacology'' (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy) of drugs, including analgesics. The analgesics and coantalgesics used are the same as those used by younger adults, but the adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous because of \"co-morbidities and polymedication\". The contribution of clinical pharmacists can be useful in screening for drug-related iatrogenia and in drug conciliation.\n\n- Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexists in the elderly.\n\n- Before any analgesic is prescribed, the patient's state of health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation and compliance must be ascertained. Dosage adjustments are recommended, dosages increased slowly (\"start low and go slow\"), and renal function monitored.\n\n- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.\n\n- It is recommended that analgesics be combined with non-pharmacological techniques, which are perfectly feasible with a few adaptations to the sensory deficits caused by ageing (sight, hearing, mobility).\n\n\n'''Revaluation'''\n\n- Always reassess to ''adapt and prioritise'' treatments in order to reduce multi-medication and optimise the benefit-risk balance.\n\n- An elderly patient who does not complain can be painful.",

They mainly concern mechanical valves, but also biological prostheses, particularly those implanted percutaneously. They are more frequent in the first year.\n\nThree main risk factors have been identified:\n\n- Prosthesis in mitral/tricuspid position versus aortic position (lower pressure regime)\n\n- Presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular dysfunction\n\n- Old generation mechanical prosthesis\n\nA poorly balanced INR remains the main cause of thrombo-embolic complications in the case of mechanical valves.\n\nIn the case of mitral and aortic prostheses, they are manifested by systemic embolisms, potentially cerebral (TIA or stroke), more rarely embolisms responsible for acute limb ischaemia, splenic or renal infarction.\n\nMore rarely, obstructive prosthesis thrombosis may occur. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy, with a picture of PAO or cardiogenic shock. Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).\n\nDiagnosis is essentially paraclinical, with TTE and TEE showing an increase in trans-valvular gradients, a reduction in the functional valve area and sometimes an image of thrombus visible on the prosthesis. In the case of mechanical prostheses, radiocinema of the valve can also reveal blockage or reduced mobility of the leaflets.\n\nINR measurement is essential in any clinical situation where there is a suspicion of prosthesis thrombosis.\n\nThe management of acute prosthesis thrombosis may require emergency surgery, with a high mortality rate (around 30%).\n\nIn sub-acute forms or those with minor dysfunction, or in inoperable patients, correction of anticoagulation or the addition of an anti-aggregant, or even thrombolysis, may be suggested.\n\nThe main differential diagnosis remains infective endocarditis.\n<br />\n\n===='''''Prosthesis disinsertion'''''====\nDisinsertion of a prosthesis is responsible for a para-prosthetic leak, i.e. between the valve annulus and the Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM flange</sup>. The main aetiology to look for and evoke remains, above all, infective endocarditis. Suture loosening without infectious origin is also possible.\n\nThe clinical picture is one of aortic or mitral insufficiency, with severity and rate of onset depending on the speed of onset and grade of the leak.\n\nAuscultation therefore reveals a diastolic aortic murmur or a systolic murmur at the mitral focus.\n\nBiological tests may reveal haemolytic anaemia (increased LDH, reduced haptoglobin and presence of shizocytes), more frequently in the mitral position.\n\nThe key examination is TTE (and TEE), which reveals a Doppler flow of para-prosthetic regurgitation.\n\nDepending on the severity and rapidity of the leak, management may range from simple monitoring to surgical intervention. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, or in subjects at high risk of surgery, percutaneous closure may be discussed.\n<br />\n[[File:Figure 5 - TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak.jpg|vignette|656x656px|Figure 5: TEE of a paraprosthetic mitral leak]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n===='''''Degeneration of bioprostheses'''''====\nThe main disadvantage of bioprostheses is that they degenerate over time. This degeneration most often expresses itself in a stenosing mode, more rarely in a receding mode (which generally progresses more rapidly) or in a mixed mode.\n\nThe average time before the appearance of ultrasound signs of degeneration is around 8 years.\n\nThe risk factors are male gender, implantation at a young age, renal insufficiency, abnormal calcium metabolism, dyslipidaemia, patient/prosthesis mismatch and bioprostheses in the mitral position.\n\n\nManagement ranges from simple monitoring in early forms to replacement of the degenerated prosthesis (either surgically or percutaneously).  \n\n[[File:Figure 6 - Bioprosthesis degeneration.jpg|thumb|Figure 6 : Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n\n===='''''Infectious endocarditis (IE)'''''====\nThis is a complication that should be systematically investigated in the event of a complication in a patient with a valve prosthesis.\n\nThe 5-year incidence of AR in valve prosthesis patients is around 5%, with the majority of events occurring in the first year following implantation.\n\nEarly postoperative AEs (<1 year after implantation) are mainly linked to \"Staphylococcus epidermitis\" or \"Aureus\".\n\nConversely, late postoperative AEs (>1 year after implantation) have a bacterial ecology similar to AEs on native valves (Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci).\n\nManagement is discussed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities, and the echocardiographic features of the IE. Antibiotic treatment is systematic, lasting at least 6 weeks, and may be combined with surgical management.\n\n<br />\n[[File:Other examples of bioprosthesis degeneration.png|alt=Bioprosthesis degeneration|thumbnail|953x953px|Bioprosthesis degeneration]]\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===='''''Hemorrhagic complications associated with VKAs'''''====\nThey concern patients with mechanical valves, but also patients with biological valves where curative anticoagulation is indicated (AF in particular). The risk is approximately 2% patient-years.\n\nThe symptoms vary: cerebral haemorrhage, digestive haemorrhage, haematuria, gingivorrhage, etc. A thorough clinical examination to look for any signs of seriousness is essential.\n\nManagement is the same as for an overdose of VKA (see Item 183).\n<br />",

In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.\n*Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches\n*AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: this requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.\n*Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent DR is a surgical \"semi-emergency\", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.\n*Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): this must be ruled out as an emergency.\n\n'''3.

It is characterised by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.\n\nHorton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) is the cause to be considered first, even though it is not the most common cause, due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered as an \"emergency\". A systematic search should therefore be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease; changes in the temporal arteries; suggestive ocular signs (episode(s) of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography, indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), temporal artery biopsy (this should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralisation and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids as a matter of urgency.\n\nArteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. One or more risk factors are generally present: smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.\n\nThe differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.\n\n=== '''Papilledema''' ===\nThis is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.\n\nSymptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.\n\nIn cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.\n\n=== '''Retro-bulbar optic neuritis (RBON)''' ===\nDamage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.\n\n\nOther causes of optic nerve damage include:\n\n- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: these neuropathies have in common that they are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead), metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).\n\n- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumours or tumours in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).\n\n== Damage to the optic chiasm ==\nCompression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as \"chiasmatic syndrome\" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e. a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibres which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.\n\n== Retrochiasmatic disease ==\nThis results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibres travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.\n\nIn terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive haematoma), tumour and trauma.\n\nA sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumour etiology.",

The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:\n\n*embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.\n*thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.\n*coagulation disorders.\n\nAetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, ''as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit''. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.\n\nThe \"treatment\" is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:\n\n*In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.\n*Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox\u00ae, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.\n*long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g. atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).\n\n== Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) ==\nCRVO is characterised by the following:\n[[File:OVCR.jpg|vignette]]\n\n*Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.\n*On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.\n*Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form;\n*Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.\n\nIn patients aged over 50, the ''etiological work-up'' is therefore usually as simple as possible:\n\n*to look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia;\n*as well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.\n\nIn cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).\n\nNon-ischaemic forms\" in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:\n\n*either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases);\n*the persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.\n\nIschaemic forms'', either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.\n\nThe development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to \"neovascular glaucoma\" (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).\n\nThe aim of ''treating'' a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.\n\nNo medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.\n\nTreatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox\u00ae) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.\n\n<br />",

The examination of the visual field (or perimetry) studies the sensitivity to light within this space by assessing the subject's perception of light tests of varying intensity and size. There are two main methods of examining the visual field: kinetic perimetry and static perimetry. Kinetic perimetry is particularly suitable for exploring peripheral deficits, particularly hemianopsia and quadranopsia. It is the examination method of choice in neuro-ophthalmology. Static perimetry is mainly indicated for optic nerve pathology, and in particular for diagnosing and monitoring chronic glaucoma. In fact, the first alterations to the visual field are very localised and central.\n\n'''B- Colour vision:''' it is useful to carry out a colour vision assessment to look for dyschromatopsia in two circumstances: 1- to detect a congenital anomaly, such as daltonism. coloured charts are used (pseudo-isochromatic charts, the best known of which is the lshihara chart). 2- in the presence of an acquired ocular condition. The Farnsworth test is usually used, in which the patient is asked to classify coloured tablets. The study of colour vision thus helps in the diagnosis of certain retinal disorders and optic neuropathies. It is also an essential element in monitoring treatments likely to cause retinopathy (synthetic anti-malarials) or optic neuropathy caused by drugs (mainly anti-tuberculosis drugs: ethambutol and isoniazid).\n\n'''C- Fundus angiography:'''' This involves taking images of the fundus after intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye which, depending on the indications, is either fluorescein or indocyanine green. Fluorescein angiography thus provides a dynamic study of retinal vascularisation. Injection of indocyanine green is mainly used to visualise pathological choroidal vessels (vascularisation of a choroidal angioma, choroidal neovessels during age-related macular degeneration).\n\n'''D-''' '''Electrophysiological investigations:'''''\n\n'''1. electroretinogram (ERG):''' The ERG is the recording of the retinal action potential secondary to light stimulation of the retina using a corneal electrode. The ERG reflects a global response of the retina and is only altered in the case of ''extensive retinal lesions'', for example certain hereditary retinal dystrophies.\n\n'''2. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs):''' they represent action potentials arising in the occipital cortex following light stimulation of the retina: they therefore explore the optic pathways in their entirety, from the ganglion cell to the occipital cortex. They can be used to diagnose optic neuropathies, and are particularly useful in multiple sclerosis, where they can be altered in the absence of any clinically detectable optic neuropathy.\n\n'''3. The electro-oculogram (EOG):''' it measures the activity of the pigment epithelium.\n\n'''E-''' '''Ultrasound:''''' The main purpose of A-mode ultrasound is to assess the length of the eyeball; the main purpose of B-mode ultrasound is to detect any retinal detachment in the case of ocular media disorders, to search for and locate an intraocular foreign body or to help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.\n\n'''F-Optical coherence tomography (OCT):''' it is used to obtain high-precision slices of the retina. Its main application is the study of macular disorders: premacular membrane, macular hole, macular oedema (diabetes, AMD), visualisation and localisation of choroidal neovessels (AMD). This method is also used to screen for and monitor chronic glaucoma, as it can reveal the loss of optic fibres, the first sign of glaucoma.\n\n'''E- Complementary examinations of the anterior segment:''''\n\n*Corneal topography: This is used to gather information about the curvature or relief (elevation) of the cornea, by projecting and analysing the reflection of a light pattern illuminating or scanning the cornea. The images collected are analysed in the form of colour maps. It is prescribed for analysing astigmatism, particularly in the search for keratoconus.\n*Biometry: this is a combined measurement of the curvature of the cornea (or keratometry) and the anterior-posterior (axial) length of the eye. The measurement is carried out using an optical device. It is used to calculate implant power in cataract surgery.\n\n\n\n\n\n<br />",

Atopy is considered to be a risk factor for developing immediate hypersensitivity symptoms (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic urticaria).\n\n'''Awareness'''\n\nA term classically used in atopy, defined by the presence of an immediate positive skin test to an allergen, without prejudging any clinical reaction of an allergic type. This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitised without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.\n\n'''Allergy'''\n\nHypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes). Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitisation and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).\n\n\n'''Allergens''' = antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.\n\n- Pneumallergens = airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.\n\n- Trophallergens = food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.\n\n- Occupational allergens = allergens present in the workplace\n\n'''Physiopathology of allergic hypersensitivities'''\n\nAll allergic hypersensitivities have two phases\n\n- A phase of ''central sensitisation'' ''in the lymph nodes'', ''asymptomatic'', which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3, see below), or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4, see below).\n\n- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.\n\n\nThere are 4 types of hypersensitivity\n\n\n1- Type 1 hypersensitivity or immediate hypersensitivity\n\no This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).\n\no It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens,\n\no After their synthesis (sensitisation phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.\n\no During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to :\n\n\u00a7 the ''release of stored mediators'' (histamine, proteases);\n\n\u00a7 the ''synthesis of other inflammatory mediators'' from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes);\n\n\u00a7 the production of ''chemokines'', which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and ''cytokines'', which perpetuate inflammation.\n\no These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation and oedema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis (''cf Lisa item 338'').\n\no Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.\n\n\nDiagram of IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity\n\n\nType 2 hypersensitivity or antibody-related cytotoxicity reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise an \"allergen carried by a target cell\".\n\n- Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.\n\n- Example: drug-induced cytopenia\n\n\nType 3 hypersensitivity or immune complex reaction\n\n- Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognise a \"circulating allergen\".\n\n- Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or \"circulating immune complexes\")\n\n- which are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells;\n\n- Example: hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.\n\n\nType 4 hypersensitivity or delayed hypersensitivity\n\n- Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitisation phase. The memory T cells recognise the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.\n\n\nFor example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema (cf Lisa item 187) and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g. pulmonary granulomatosis).",

Before 6 months, the mechanism is essentially reflex.\n\nRepeated retention of stool in the rectal ampulla leads to constipation. This is terminal retention.\n\nOther mechanisms may contribute to functional constipation:\n\n- Lack of water or fibre intake\n\n- Exclusive lacto-meal diet\n\nThe organic origin is explained by different mechanisms, depending on the cause:\n\n- Absence of colonic contraction\n\n- Ionic disorders\n\n- Medicines\n\n- Insufficient thrust\n\n- Hypertonia of the sphincter\n\n- Anal obstruction",

A clinical examination and ultrasound scan may be carried out at any time in the event of functional signs suggesting a haemorrhagic complication of the EP. A 2nd<sup>injection</sup> of MTX should be considered if the decrease in the plasma \u03b2-hCG level at D7 is not satisfactory compared with the initial level (in practice, the \u03b2-hCG level at D7 should be strictly lower than the level at D0 or strictly lower than 85% of the \u03b2-hCG level at D4 if this is available).

On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard x-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures (Figure 1). Any displaced rib fracture should be scanned for pneumothorax, haemothorax or laceration of the lung parenchyma.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"300\">\nFile:3.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. A.

It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.\n\nThe aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths=\"1000\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:1.jpg|'''Figure 1'''. Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray. A-B. Solitary fibrous tumour of the pleura. C-D. Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes. E-F. Aneurysm of the aortic arch. G-H. Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos.\n</gallery><br />Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths=\"800\" heights=\"600\">\nFile:2.jpg|'''Figure 2''. A-B.

The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumour pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, oesophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are haematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukaemia).\n\n'''Identification of an abnormal mediastinal image'''\n\nReading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum), which involves analysing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density (Figure 1).<gallery widths=\"650\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediastpedia1.jpg|'''Figure 1. Mediastinal reflection lines.'''

The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. There are many other causes: intra-alveolar haemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organised pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.\n\nThe definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:\n\n*pulmonary opacity (denser or \"whiter\" than normal parenchyma)\n*containing images of aerated bronchi (= aerated bronchogram)\n\nThe term \"systemic\" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe (Figure 1). The silhouette sign can help to localise the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term \"retractile\" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, we speak of ''''''athelectasis''.\n\nCT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray, and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary oedema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.<gallery widths=\"700\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Alv1.JPG|'''Figure 1.''' Front chest X-ray showing a systematised opacity of the right upper lobe with a clear stop at the contact of the small scissure (blue arrows). The presence of tubular aerial images within the opacity corresponds to bronchi that remain aerated (= aeric bronchogram, orange arrow).\n</gallery>\n\n\nSpecial presentations :\n\n*Acute lobar frank pneumonia: non-retractable systematised alveolar syndrome in a patient with fever and cough (Figure 2).\n*Some bacterial, fungal or viral pneumonias may present as multiple poorly limited alveolar opacities.\n*Acute pulmonary oedema: bilateral, symmetrical, peri-hilar alveolar syndrome, often associated with bilateral pleural effusion.\n*Alveolar bronchial cancer: more or less extensive alveolar opacities, sometimes nodular, containing an aerated bronchogram, in a patient at risk of bronchial cancer.\n*Intra-alveolar haemorrhage: alveolar opacities, the topography of which indicates the site of bleeding (Figure 3).\n*Organised pneumonia (cryptogenic or secondary): alveolar opacities are bilateral and migratory (Figure 4)<br />\n<gallery widths=\"300\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Alv2.jpg|'''Figure 2.'''

This opacity has the following characteristics\n#*Systematised with sharp edges.

A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localise atelectasis.

It is arbitrarily divided into three compartments, which are often defined as such on a profile X-ray (Figure 1):\n\n*The ''anterior mediastinum'', which contains fatty tissue, the thymus and ganglion chains.\n*The middle mediastinum, which contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.\n*The '''posterior mediastinum''', which contains the descending thoracic aorta, oesophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, lymph node chains\n<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"400\">\nFile:Mediast1.jpg|'''Figure 1.''' Segmentation of the mediastinum illustrated on profile chest radiograph. In blue: anterior mediastinum; in green: middle mediastinum; in yellow: posterior mediastinum.\n</gallery>\n\n\nMediastinal abnormalities may correspond to :\n\n*The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Example: mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumour, paraspinal abscess, bronchogenic cyst, etc.\n*''An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure.'' Example: aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, cardiomegaly.\n*''An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure'' in the mediastinum. Example: intra-thoracic thyroid goitre, hiatal hernia.\n\n\nThe main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are summarised in the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Anterior mediastinum\n|Middle mediastinum\n|Posterior mediastinum'''\n|-\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|Adenopathies (including lymphomas)\n|-\n|Thymic tumours\n|Bronchogenic cysts\n|Neurogenic tumours\n|-\n|Germ Cell Tumours\n|Vascular dilations\n|Oesophageal tumours\n|-\n|Thyroid gland\n|\n|Hiatal hernia\n|-\n|Pleuropericardial cyst\n|\n|\n|}\n\n\nOn a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality ''is characterised by an opacity''.\n\n*A clear external boundary convex towards the lung\n*Gently sloping into the mediastinum\n*Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements\n*Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum\n\n[[File:Bords mediastinaux.jpg|vignette|'''Figure 2.''' Mediastinal borders. BC: brachiocephalic. In blue: upper arches, in green: middle arches, in yellow: lower arches]]\n\nThe ''mediastinal contours'' (Figure 2) are therefore often distorted. On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava. On the left, the superior arch corresponds to the left subclavian artery, the middle arch to the aortic button and pulmonary artery, and the inferior arch to the left ventricle.<gallery widths=\"600\" heights=\"550\">\n</gallery>\n\n\nThe left pulmonary hilum is always slightly higher than the right. Normal pulmonary hili are never convex.\n\nA frequently encountered mediastinal anomaly is cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly is defined on a chest X-ray taken in the standing position only, by a '''cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5'' (Figure 3).<gallery widths=\"500\" heights=\"500\">\nFile:Mediast3.JPG|'''Figure 3'''. Cardiothoracic index. The dotted line passes through the spinous processes of the thoracic vertebrae. The index is calculated by the ratio (c+c')/t\n</gallery>\n\n\nWhile chest X-rays can detect mediastinal abnormalities, thoracic CT is the examination of choice for ''pinpointing the location of the abnormality and characterising the lesion''. Mediastinal MRI may also be indicated in certain special cases.\n\nExample of mediastinal abnormalities on chest radiograph (with CT images provided for illustration) : Figures 4-7<gallery widths=\"475\" heights=\"275\">\nFile:Mediast4.JPG|'''Figure 4''' A.

It is a monogenic autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It affects one in every 4,700 births.  One subject in 35 is a heterozygous carrier of a mutation in the CFTR gene. The most common mutation in France is F508del.  Life expectancy at birth is over 40 years.\n\nSituations at risk of foetal cystic fibrosis\n\n- Ultrasound monitoring\n\nThe diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be raised during ultrasound monitoring of pregnancy when a hyperechoic bowel is observed. This is a non-specific warning sign which may reveal a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in around 5% of cases. This risk is increased if the hyperechoic bowel is accompanied by an absence of visualization of the gallbladder. A study of the CFTR gene is then carried out in the couple. If mutations in the gene are detected in one or both of the couple's partners, the mutations are tested in the foetus using an amniotic fluid sample.  \n\n- Family history of cystic fibrosis\n\nBoth parents are heterozygous carriers of a CFTR mutation.\n\nThe risk of transmitting the disease to offspring is 1/4 with each pregnancy.\n\nPrenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling from 11 weeks of amenorrhoea, or by amniocentesis from 16 weeks of amenorrhoea. Once the foetal DNA has been extracted, molecular biology is used to determine the presence or absence of parental CFTR gene mutations. A pre-implantation diagnosis may also be proposed. If heterozygous status is only known for one parent, a full study of the CFTR gene must be carried out for the other spouse to determine the risk.\n\nOne of the parents has cystic fibrosis\n\nA parent with cystic fibrosis must pass on one of the two mutations he or she carries. It is necessary to determine the status of the spouse by carrying out an exhaustive study of the CFTR gene.  If the spouse is heterozygous, the risk of transmitting the disease is 1/2, and prenatal or pre-implantation diagnosis is proposed.",

Resting tremor (or parkinsonian tremor) ===\nResting tremor (or Parkinsonian tremor) is present at rest and disappears during muscle contraction and sleep, is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, never the head or voice, is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. It is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigrostriatal pathway]] but is not mandatory for diagnosis.\n\nTremor SD-128|trembling]] can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, in particular Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome (see below).\n\nIf the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is aged over 40, no further tests are necessary.\n\nConversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.\n\n===2.  Action tremor===\n- Present when maintaining a posture ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] postural) and/or arriving at the target ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] intentional).\n\nThe most common cause of postural [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]] is essential [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]].\n\nThis is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head, which progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre) or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre), performs an action such as pouring water from one glass to another (the glass test) or holds a note aloud (voice tremor). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.\n\n===3.  Cerebellar tremor===\n- This is an action [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor).\n\n- Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test).\n\n- Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria (and not a genuine speech and/or phonation disorder) on finger-nose and heel-knee manoeuvres, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre) and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability and incoordination of movements.\n\n- Similarly, in the event of an acute cerebellar syndrome, vitamin B1 should be measured/supplemented in order to search for/treat Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy, which may be responsible for mental confusion/disorientation.\n\n- Acute drunkenness is a frequent cause of acute cerebellar syndrome and warrants prevention of alcohol-related risks.\n\n- The acute onset of a cerebellar syndrome warrants a [[request for a cerebral imaging test]] in search of a cerebellar ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, which may be the cause of compression of the fourth ventricle responsible for hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, which may also be the cause of [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]. \n\n===4.  Exaggeration of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] physiological:===\nExaggeration of the [[Trembling SD-128|trembling]] physiological: in this case there is systematically the [[suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care]] (see below). Particular circumstances (hyperthyroidism: analysis of thyroid balance with TSH measurement; excessive consumption of caffeine) may cause an exaggeration of the physiological tremor (which is a normal phenomenon, of muscular origin, not linked to an attack on the central nervous system), which may then be confused with a tremor of another nature.\n\n===5.  [[Tremor SD-128|Trumbling]] functional (or psychogenic)===\nThis is a [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that does not correspond to any neurological pathology described above. It is usually characterised by a sudden onset (often in an emotional context or in a patient with psychological fragility), distractibility (during a competing task, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] disappears or changes), frequency entrainment (during a motor task performed by the contralateral limb at a given frequency, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] tends to adopt the same frequency). It may be present both at rest and in action (which is unusual), may disappear spontaneously, and may be polymorphous and atypical (neurological abnormalities that cannot be systematised, etc.). It tends to occur in people with a history of somatisation.",

Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).\n\n'''Attention'''\n\n- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''', '''[[Mental Confusion/Disorientation SD-119|mental Confusion/Disorientation]]''' (which result from severe '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''') and '''[[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and Consciousness Disorder]]'''''\n\n- Attention is necessary for all the major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.\n\n- Tests by repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.\n\n'''Perceptual integration functions'''\n\n- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects and the body schema.\n\n- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe), and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.\n\n- '''Temporal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Aphasia''' ('''[[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]]''') by impairment of comprehension, '''visual agnosia''' (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects (colours or shapes) or more complex ones (faces, manufactured or living objects)\n\no Tests understanding of simple commands (\"close your eyes\"), naming of objects or faces.\n\n- '''Parietal lobe involvement:'''\n\no '''Apraxia''' (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), '''visual neglect''' '''unilateral''', i.e. inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), '''disturbance of the representation of the body schema'' (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc).\n\no Tested by copying a geometric figure (MMSE image), drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (\"military salute\", \"nose-thumbing\") and gestures involving the use of objects (\"brushing teeth\", \"combing hair\", \"playing the violin\", \"hammering a nail\").\n\n'''Memory'''\n\n- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.) but in the tests, ''episodic memory'' is mainly assessed.\n\n- '''Episodic memory''' :\n\no the ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e. the place, the moment, the emotional state)\n\no the critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or \"consolidation\")\n\no depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the ''hippocampi'' and adjacent cortices.\n\no Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to \"progressive forgetting\" (\"What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?\").\n\n- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.\n\no 1. read five words (\"Museum\", \"Lemonade\", \"Colander\", \"Grasshopper\" and \"Truck\") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (\"What is the drink?\"...).\n\no 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).\n\no 3.

It is not uncommon for the patient to minimise the complaint (anosognosia), while the family and friends are concerned about it''([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]]).''''\n\nOn neuropsychological assessment, the most characteristic memory impairment in AD is \"episodic memory consolidation disorder\". In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.\n\nIn verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterised by :\n\n- no encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words)\n\n- a collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge)\n\n- above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word \"truck\": \"what was the vehicle?\"), with clues often causing \"intrusions\" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.\n\nConsolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the \"five-word test\", a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item \"free recall/indexed recall\".\n\nThis profile of memory impairment :\n\n- as opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).\n\n- results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome)\n\n- is a good clinical argument in favour of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease)\n\n- is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD)\n\n- is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.",

Spermatic cord torsion is manifested by acute, intense, unilateral, sudden scrotal pain, usually nocturnal. The pain is continuous, with no analgesic position, and radiates towards the inguinal region, along the spermatic cord towards the iliac fossa. It may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. When questioning the patient, it is important to find out when the symptoms began. The bursa is painful, enlarged, sometimes red and warm. During lifting manoeuvres, the bursa remains painful (negative Prehn's sign). The testicle is elevated and retracted at the inguinal ring. The cremasteric reflex is absent.\n*''Orchiepididymitis'': Before puberty and after the age of 35, orchiepididymitis is usually associated with urinary tract infections in children and adults (urogenital infections 161) and sexually transmitted infections (STI): gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis (trichomoniasis 162). From puberty to the age of 35, orchi-epididymitis is frequently secondary to a sexually transmitted infection. The clinical presentation of orchi-epididymitis is painful enlargement of a bursa. It may be associated with a progressive fever, or more rarely a sudden onset. Its intensity varies according to the pathogen, and the pain is associated with local signs of varying intensity: scrotal pain radiating along the cord, progressive and not sudden onset (as opposed to torsion of the spermatic cord), painful induration of the cord and all or part of the epididymis. The scrotum is inflamed. Lifting the testicle usually relieves the pain (positive Prehn's sign), making it possible to distinguish torsion. Any doubt about the diagnosis of torsion of the spermatic cord (particularly in the absence of general signs and functional urinary signs) should lead to surgical exploration to rule out torsion.\n*''Scrotal trauma''': Most often, this is a young patient who, following direct perineal or scrotal trauma, presents with acute, intense scrotal pain. There may be nausea and vomiting. Clinical examination reveals a large non-inflammatory bursa (haematocele: blood in the vaginal cavity), with a scrotal haematoma. Transillumination is negative (haematocele), but clinical examination is often difficult because of the severity of the pain. It is therefore impossible to assess the integrity of the testicle. Several types of lesion may be found:\n**Scrotal haematoma (rare)\n**Intra-testicular haematoma\n**Haematocele: blood effusion inside the vaginal cavity. It is the result of testicular rupture.\n**Testicular contusion: the albuginea is intact and there is no intra-testicular haematoma.\n**Testicular fracture: there is a rupture of the albuginea with exit of the testicular pulp into the vaginal cavity.\n**Lesions of the testicular appendages (epididymis or spermatic cord): lesions of the epididymis are rare and the cord is most often respected by the trauma due to its mobility.\n\n==A painless, enlarged bursa should prompt the diagnosis of:==\n\n*''Testicular cancer'' ([[Testicular tumours|item 313]]): Testicular cancers occur in young men (aged 15-35). Cryptorchidism is the main risk factor for testicular cancer. Testicular cancer is discovered in the following circumstances: autopalpation, infertility test, gynaecomastia, prevalent metastasis. The testicle is hard, stony, irregular and not very sensitive. The tumour markers are: alpha-feto-protein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Biopsy is contraindicated and diagnosis is made by inguinal orchiectomy.\n*An inguinal or inguino-scrotal hernia is a painless swelling of the groin fold (unless strangulated), which can be reduced when coughing.\n*A hydrocele is the accumulation of intravaginal serous fluid between the testicle and its vaginal envelope. The clinical presentation is that of an enlarged, painless bursa. Questioning may reveal variations in volume during the day, particularly in children (communicating hydrocele secondary to the persistence of a permeable peritoneo-vaginal canal). Positive transillumination confirms the diagnosis.\n*In adults, the hydrocele is non-communicating and linked to an anomaly of the vagina. The hernial orifices are free.\n*A cord cyst'': the clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a regular painless swelling, suspended above and independent of the testicle, without pain.\n*''A varicocele'': A varicocele is the varicose dilatation of the veins of the pampiniform plexus of the cord. A varicocele may be discovered during a systematic examination, an isolated deformity of the scrotum, a functional symptom such as discomfort, heaviness, especially when standing or during intense or prolonged physical effort, often relieved by decubitus, as part of an assessment of male infertility, or very rarely associated with local complications: non-traumatic rupture or thrombophlebitis. Inspection in the standing position may reveal a deformity of the posterior and upper part of the scrotum, of varying size, behind the testicle and along the cord, which diminishes with decubitus. Palpation reveals a varicose swelling that is impulsive on coughing and increases in volume on exhalation with the glottis closed (Valsalva manoeuvre), and whose consistency is sometimes compared to that of a \"bag of worms\". Varicocele is common and even normal in young pubescent adolescents on the left side (blood reflux from the left renal vein into the left gonadal vein). A varicocele should be considered suspicious on the right side or of recent onset [[Neoplasms of the kidney|(kidney cancer 311]]), compressive adenopathy, venous thrombosis). In this case, imaging (ultrasound or abdominal CT or MRI) is recommended.\n\n=='''Cryptorchidism''': is defined as a testicle spontaneously and permanently located outside the scrotum, at any point along the normal path of testicular migration. Cryptorchidism excludes:==\n\n*oscillating or ascending testicles, which may descend spontaneously into the scrotum and which, in young boys, hyperactivity of the cremaster causes to ascend to the superficial inguinal ring\n*ectopic testicles, which are located at a point outside the normal path of testicular migration. The location may be perineal, femoral, pubo-penile or contralateral intra-scrotal. Ectopia may be observed in cases of scrotal trauma (dislocation).\n*The examination should be carried out gently, with warm hands and the child lying supine, thighs apart and legs half-bent, so as to achieve complete muscle relaxation. The inguino-scrotal region is palpated with both hands, the upper hand pressing firmly on the abdominal wall to bring the gonad downwards while the lower hand moves upwards from the scrotum. When the cryptorchid testicle can be palpated, its position, both spontaneously and after manipulation, its volume and consistency must be specified. The testicle may be normal or atrophic and soft. If examination of the inguino-scrotal region is negative, the testicle should be sought in an ectopic position. Following a complete examination, several clinical situations may arise:\n**Unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism with palpable testicles (80% of cases)\n**Non-palpable testicles (20% of cases)\n**Bilateral cryptorchidism with non-palpable testicles: An endocrine investigation and a karyotype should be performed to rule out anorchidism or a sexual differentiation disorder.\n\n=='''Anomalies of the penis''' are:==\n\n*Phimosis'': phimosis is defined as a relative stenosis of the preputial orifice which prevents complete retraction of the skin behind the glans. It is physiological in children up to the age of 5. When it appears in adulthood, it must be considered pathological (scleratrophic lichen, cancer of the penis, unbalanced diabetes mellitus).\n*Paraphimosis: this is a complication of phimosis. It is secondary to forced retraction of the preputial ring with forgetfulness or inability to recalibrate. In the absence of recalibration, oedema of the prepuce and glans will form and create a constriction in the balanopreputial groove.\n*'''Penile thickening''': This is noticeable during erection. In children (congenital curvature), it is noticed either by the parents, or by a doctor during a systematic examination or by the adolescent. In most cases, it is associated with hypospadias. In adults, it is secondary to fibrous plaques of the corpora cavernosa (Lapeyronie's disease item 126), which are painful in the initial phase and then painless. It can be the cause of erectile dysfunction item 126.\n*Cancer of the penis'': this is a squamous cell cancer, affecting adult men (> 50 years old). Favouring factors are pre-cancerous lesions (erythroplasia), lichen sclero-atrophic, HPV infections and lack of circumcision. It sits on the sheath of the penis or the foreskin. It may present as acquired phimosis or an indurated, ulcerated, painless, vegetating and progressive lesion of the penis. The 1st lymph node is inguinal.\n\n==''Urethral meatus anomalies''':==\n\n*'''<small>Urethral meatus stenosis:</small>''' In the vast majority of cases, it is secondary (repair of an abnormal meatus, circumcision). Congenital stenosis will be due to a channeling defect of the balanic urethra. In adults, it is secondary to chronic inflammation or scleratrophic lichen. It may be revealed by dysuria, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|chronic urinary retention (item 125)]) sometimes with renal failure, [[Disorders of micturition and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|urinary incontinence (125)]] (child), or [[Urinary infections in children and adults|urinary infections (161)]]. On examination the meatus is punctiform and fibrous.\n*<small>'''Hypospadias:'''</small> a hypospadias is defined by a urethral meatus which, instead of being located at the apex of the glans (navicular fossa), is located all along the course of the urethra, bulbar, penile or balanic (most common), on the ventral surface of the penis or on the perineum, behind the bursae. The foreskin is not closed ventrally and has the classic \"sapper's apron\" appearance. In a certain number of cases, hypospadia is associated with penile discolouration. This discolouration can only be observed during erection. Hypospadia is purely functional and aesthetic and does not lead to urinary signs or erectile dysfunction. Fertility is normal.\n*<small>'''Epispadias:'''</small> Epispadias is defined by the presence of the urethral meatus on the dorsal surface of the penis. This orifice may be located very proximally at the level of the bladder neck (penopubic or suprapubic, with bladder exstrophy) or more distally (penile) as far as the dorsal surface of the glans (balanic), which then takes the form of 2 hemiglands separated by a longitudinal groove open dorsally. The penis, which is of normal calibre, is short and curved towards the abdominal wall: a sort of dorsal curvature of the penis. They are associated with a spread of the pubis and rectus abdominis muscles to varying degrees. Epispadias may be observed in cases of bladder exstrophy. Urinary continence disorders and erectile dysfunction may occur in cases of associated anomalies of the penis.\n\n<br />",

The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders and cognitive disorders.\n\n'''The different origins of gait disorders:'''\n\n- Walking disorders of ''painful'' origin. The disorder observed is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific (exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease: muscular glycogenosis).\n\n- Walking disorders of ''ataxic'' origin. (i) cerebellar ataxia (static, kinetic and locomotor cerebellar syndrome), (ii) vestibular ataxia (vertigo, gait deviation, manoeuvres), (iii) proprioceptive ataxia (heeling gait, hypopallesthesia).\n\n- Gait disorders of \"central\" origin. Central motor deficit disorder: sequelae of a cerebrovascular accident, essentially in the form of hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.\n\n- Peripheral gait disorders. Motor disorders of peripheral origin: often predominant in the extremities (steppage), or muscular disorders whose deficient topography is often symmetrical and predominantly proximal, giving a waddling gait.\n\n- Gait disorder with ''gait with small steps''. Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.\n\n'''Other walking disorders:''''\n\n- Dystonia: (hyperkinetic motor disorder) pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, \"heron\" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, \"dromedary gait\" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.\n\n- Chorea: (hyperkinetic motor disorder)\n\n- Tremor (primary orthostatic tremor)\n\n- Trendelenburg lameness (instability with lowering of the pelvis on the non-weight-bearing side)",

Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.\n\nWhen the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.\n\nThe classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:\n\n- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)\n\n- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)\n\n- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)\n\n- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in \"looking for associated lesions\": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",

Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor (civil or criminal).\n\n'''Misconduct and disciplinary sanctions'''\n\nDisciplinary offences\n\nAny breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des M\u00e9decins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.\n\nThis Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des m\u00e9decins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.\n\nDisciplinary sanctions\n\nThe penalties incurred are a warning, a reprimand, a temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities, a temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years) or removal from the roll of the Ordre.\n\nTemporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.\n\n'''Implementation of disciplinary liability'''\n\n'''Jurisdictions'''\n\nThe competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.\n\n'''Referral'''\n\nReferrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by a departmental council of the Ordre, the national council of the Ordre, a doctor, a doctors' union, the director of the regional health agency, the prefect, the public prosecutor and the minister responsible for health.\n\nFor doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, the Conseil national de l'Ordre, the Director of the Regional Health Agency, the Prefect, the Public Prosecutor and the Minister for Health.\n\nA patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation.\n\nIf this fails, the Conseil d\u00e9partemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil r\u00e9gional de l'Ordre.\n\n'''Procedure'''\n\nThe patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague. Proceedings before the Order's courts are adversarial; the hearing is public.",

It is referred to as an \"attack\" when complaints are of short duration and include a painful component, or as a chronic disease when signs are regular. Symptoms are usually accompanied by a morphological change in the haemorrhoids, but there is no anatomo-clinical correlation (people can complain of small haemorrhoids, or have large haemorrhoids without feeling them). The pathogenesis of haemorrhoidal disease is only partially understood. There are two theories that lead to a normal, asymptomatic anatomical component becoming symptomatic: the mechanical theory and the vascular theory.\n\n- The mechanical theory is based on a weakening of the support tissue or anchoring material of the internal haemorrhoids: long bowel movements, straining (dyschesia), changes in stool consistency (hard stools) and childbirth are risk factors for the onset of haemorrhoidal signs. Many patients express the fact that the onset of signs of haemorrhoidal disease coincides with childbirth.\n\n- Vascular theory likens haemorrhoidal disease to venous insufficiency. However, haemorrhoids are not veins (they do not have congenital valves) and the red bleeding of a haemorrhoidal crisis is not venous. However, the increase in size of haemorrhoidal tissue at the end of pregnancy and the short-term effectiveness of so-called veinotonic treatments support this hypothesis.\n\nCf item ''[[2C-288-ET-B01]]''''",

Dietary exclusion diets are not effective. Generally speaking, dietary hygiene rules aim to combat chronic constipation (cf [[Constipation in children and adults|item 283]]). Treating chronic constipation is therefore a common-sense measure aimed at limiting the onset of haemorrhoidal disease, preventing recurrences and perhaps even complications.  Dietary changes that help to correct stool consistency and regulate transit are recommended. Introducing a diet rich in soluble fibre (linseed, chia seeds, blond psyllium, etc.) and correcting constipation can reduce the time spent having a bowel movement and reduce dyschezia. This helps to resolve symptoms in the acute phase of haemorrhoidal attacks, prevent attacks and treat chronic haemorrhoidal disease.\n\n==b) Medication:==\n'''Treatment of internal haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nDiosmin has proven efficacy in the treatment of haemorrhoidal attacks because it reduces the intensity and duration of symptoms''. Local topicals include all ''emollient products'' for topical application (creams, ointments and suppositories). They contain agents capable of reducing the inflammatory component of the haemorrhoidal crisis, acting on the oedematous component of the crisis and promoting healing. Some topicals also have analgesic properties through local anaesthetics. Like the class of venotonics, these drugs are offered as short courses of treatment for haemorrhoidal attacks. They are not indicated in cases of chronic pathology, mainly dominated by bleeding or defecatory anal procidence.\n\n'''Treatment of external haemorrhoidal disease:'''\n\nThe only manifestation of external haemorrhoids is external haemorrhoidal thrombosis, which is treated by incision or excision (see below). However, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are an alternative to incision/excision (see below). Short courses of corticosteroids are an alternative in cases where NSAIDs and surgical treatment are contraindicated, particularly where there is a strong oedematous component.\n\n==c) Principles of instrumental and surgical treatments\nThe term ''instrumental haemorrhoid treatment'' refers to all the procedures carried out to constrain the haemorrhoidal anal procidence, ''reinforce the supporting tissue and form a scar'' at the top of the haemorrhoid. These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease. They should not be carried out during a flare-up of the disease and do not represent a preventive treatment for external haemorrhoidal thrombosis. Various techniques can be used to create a chemical (sclerosis), ischaemic (elastic ligation) or thermal (infrared, bipolar coagulation, cryotherapy) eschar. The treatment is applied in a sector, in the rectal mucosa (no thermoalgesic sensitivity) above (and not on top of) the internal haemorrhoidal tissue. These methods do not remove or sclerotise the haemorrhoidal tissue itself. When the indications are well-targeted, they provide significant benefit more than three times out of four. However, their effectiveness decreases with the length of follow-up. These methods may give rise to rare complications (bleeding following the fall of an eschar, infections). Elastic ligation offers the best risk/benefit ratio, but is contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants.\n\n\nSurgical haemorrhoid treatment'' is the term used to describe all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural or locoregional anaesthetic. There are \"two types of haemorrhoidal surgery\": \"those which remove\" the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and \"those which fix or tighten\" the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.\n\nThe treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, ''an incision or excision'' can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in ''relieving pain and shortening its course''. The alternative is to prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (see above).",

These flatworms release rings containing eggs in patients' faeces. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs (faeco-oral transmission) or larvae contained in undercooked or uncooked meat from intermediate hosts (beef for \"T.saginata\" and pork for \"T.solium\").\n\nIngestion of T. solium eggs leads to cysticercosis (migration of cysticerci into tissues, the neurological form of which is serious), and ingestion of larvae to adult tapeworms in the digestive tract.\n\n'''<u>Trichinellosis</u>''''\n\nTrichinellosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis, and humans are accidental hosts. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked meat contaminated with encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae travel to the striated muscles. Clinical symptoms typically take the form of febrile polymyositis and facial oedema. The course can be serious (fatal) in the early phase of larval dissemination.\n\n'''<u>Anisakidosis</u>''''\n\nAnisakiasis is a zoonosis of the cold seas. Humans are accidental hosts, contracting the disease by ingesting raw, marinated or undercooked fish infested with larvae. The symptoms are digestive, with gastralgia, nausea and vomiting soon after the infested meal. Intestinal or generalised allergic reactions are sometimes observed (and sometimes anaphylactic shock).",

It is cosmopolitan, but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebosis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebosis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues (by vegetative forms of \"Entamoeba histolytica histolytica\").\n\n'''<u>Cryptosporidiosis</u>''''\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhoea, and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.\n\n'''<u>Giardiasis</u>''''\n\nGiardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhoea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.\n\n'''<u>Toxoplasmosis</u>''''\n\nToxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat faeces, and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases, and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",

Knowing the definition of unreasonable obstinacy and therapeutic prolongation, the need to respect the wishes of the patient, the need to work to relieve pain and suffering, sedation. Understand the concepts of limiting and stopping treatment. Distinguish between treatment and care. Know the definition of palliative care.\n|Rubrique=Management\n|Contributors=C\u00e9line Lef\u00e8ve\n|Ordre=18}}The L\u00e9onetti law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life and the Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law of 2 February 2016 aim to improve care for patients at the end of life. The issue here for medicine is not to initiate or prolong active therapies, but to know how to withdraw in order to maintain only so-called palliative care, which can go as far as deep and continuous sedation until death. These laws have thus provided a framework for the possibility (at the request of the patient or next of kin) or even the obligation (for the doctor, and in dialogue with the patient or family) to stop medical treatments that are disproportionate or only contribute to maintaining vital functions, while maintaining care that preserves the patient's dignity.\n\nThese laws are part of a profound social and legal movement dating from the 1970s-1980s aimed at promoting patient autonomy and, in particular, giving patients the means to communicate their wishes regarding the end of life. This movement can be explained by advances in medical technology, which now make it possible to prolong life long after patients have lost the ability to express themselves. Artificial respiration, nutrition and circulation can be provided before or during the end of life. Around 70% of the French population die in hospital.\n\n# The right to support at the end of one's life and to refuse unreasonable obstinacy\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law states that everyone has the right to ''access to palliative care and support at the end of life'': ''Everyone has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible relief of suffering. Healthcare professionals will do everything in their power to ensure that this right is respected. \"Everyone has the right to receive treatment and care designed to relieve their suffering. In all circumstances, this suffering must be prevented, taken into account, assessed and treated.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law reaffirms \"the patient's right to refuse or interrupt treatment\" or an investigation and prescribes the continuation of his or her follow-up, in particular palliative care. \"If, by refusing or interrupting treatment, the patient's life is endangered, he or she must reiterate this decision within a reasonable time. They may call on another member of the medical profession. It imposes an obligation on the doctor to respect the person's wishes, after informing them of the consequences of their choices and their seriousness, to refuse or not to receive treatment.\n\nThe 2016 law enshrines '''the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy'''<nowiki>: \"When they appear unnecessary, disproportionate or when they have no effect other than the sole artificial maintenance of life, [treatment] may be suspended or not be undertaken, in accordance with the patient's wishes and, if the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation.\"</nowiki>\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: ''limiting care'' and ''stopping care''. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy. In the case of limitation, the aim is to refrain from implementing measures likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. It means not undertaking certain prolongation treatments that are technically possible, but without the aim of improving the patient's condition. Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment involves the suspension of vital treatment in progress, such as artificial respiration.\n\nThe 2016 law confirmed that artificial nutrition and hydration should be considered as \"treatments\" like any others, and may be suspended provided that the patient has, either directly or indirectly (via advance directives, for example), expressed his or her wish not to continue them. If this is the case, patients should be reassured that they will be comfortable and will not feel thirsty (thanks to the vigilance of the care teams, who will offer regular mouth care) or hungry.\n\nFor people who are not capable of expressing themselves, no decision to limit treatment may be taken by the doctor without first convening a collegial procedure, the aim of which will be to ascertain the patient's wishes as they may have expressed them previously. This procedure requires a meeting to be held within the healthcare department with all the healthcare professionals familiar with the situation. A second medical opinion must also be given during this collegial procedure. Next, the doctor in charge of the patient must consult the patient's advance directives, or, failing that, the trusted support person and, failing that, the family or close friends. Finally, it is the doctor in charge of the patient who will decide whether or not to stop treatment, having been informed of the patient's wishes.\n\n# The right to deep and continuous sedation\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law affirms the right to benefit from ''deep and continuous sedation until death when the vital prognosis is engaged in the short term'': ''At the patient's request to avoid all suffering and not to undergo unreasonable obstinacy, deep and continuous sedation causing an alteration of consciousness maintained until death, associated with analgesia and the cessation of all life-sustaining treatments'' is possible in cases that the legislator specifies: \"1\u00b0 When a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease whose vital prognosis is at risk in the short term is suffering in a way that is refractory to treatment; 2\u00b0 When the decision of a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease to stop treatment is at risk in the short term and is likely to cause unbearable suffering. When the patient is unable to express his or her wishes and, as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy referred to in Article L. 1110-5-1, in the event that the doctor stops life-sustaining treatment, the doctor shall apply deep and continuous sedation causing altered consciousness that is maintained until death, combined with analgesia\".\n\nA refractory symptom is defined as one which is unbearably perceptible and which cannot be relieved despite obstinate efforts to find a suitable therapeutic protocol without compromising the patient's consciousness.\n\nDeep and continuous sedation is based on the \"double effect argument\": \"The physician implements all analgesic and sedative treatments to respond to the refractory suffering of the patient in an advanced or terminal phase, even if they may have the effect of shortening life\". To clarify the distinction between acting and refraining from acting, and between acting and ceasing to act, we can refer to the intentions of the agent: the intention to cause death, which constitutes \"active\" euthanasia, differs from the intention of the person who refrains from continuing a treatment deemed unnecessary or harmful, and therefore excessive, a situation of unreasonable, disproportionate obstinacy, known as \"therapeutic overkill\", and condemned by the principle of non-maleficence. This distinction means that the term \"euthanasia\" is reserved for the \"active\", full, deliberate intention to end a life, an act that is criminal according to the law and reprobated by traditional medical ethics, which are still upheld by medical institutions and authorities. And room is made for the possible legitimacy, in certain circumstances, of an act which, even if it shortens life, no longer fights against an inescapable death and aims \"first and foremost\" to relieve suffering, and will no longer be qualified as euthanasia for this reason.  The main justification for drawing a line between euthanasia and non-euthanasia is to distinguish the intended effect of an act from its foreseeable but unintended side-effects. This is the \"double effect\" argument that inspired the 2005 law on the end of life, revised in 2016. According to this argument, the undesirable, \"bad\" consequences of an action that is considered to be primarily \"good\" do not necessarily prevent that action from being taken. For example, it is possible to relieve the suffering of an incurable patient at the end of life, even if the intensive administration of painkillers hastened the patient's death. The spirit of the principle of double effect is to say that while we can never will evil, even for the sake of a good, we can nevertheless will a good even if the result is evil, when the aim of this good is deemed to take priority. The aim of the primary good is imposed despite the evil that will be its effect. The advantage is to get out of a moral conflict between opposing duties: to relieve suffering, to protect life. In this way, we can say that there is no such thing as \"euthanasia\" because the desire is in no way to cause death, but to relieve a sick person in a proportionate way. Death, the foreseeable but unintended consequence of the act, remains secondary to the main aim, which is to avoid suffering in the final moments. Monotheistic religions therefore accept the relief of suffering at the end of life, even if life is shortened. Thanks to the double effect argument, the principle of respect for life can be made more flexible and become compatible with a concern for quality of life.\n\n# Respecting the wishes of people at the end of their lives\n\nThe option for patients to write down their advance directives, i.e. their wishes regarding \"the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures\", has existed since the 2005 law. The main new feature of the 2016 law is that it is now binding.\n\nThe Clayes-L\u00e9onetti law provides for \"advance directives and the designation of a trusted support person\" to enable people who are no longer able to express their wishes to have their rights recognised. Advance directives become the preferred expression of the wishes of patients who are no longer able to express themselves. \"Any person of legal age may draw up advance directives in the event that they are one day unable to express their wishes. These advance directives express the wishes of the person in relation to the end of their life as regards the conditions for continuing, limiting, stopping or refusing medical treatment or procedures. \"They may be revised and revoked at any time and by any means.\n\nAdvance directives are now ''binding'' on doctors. \"When a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is unable to express his wishes, the doctor is obliged to enquire about the expression of the patient's wishes. In the absence of the advance directives referred to in article L. 1111-11, the doctor shall obtain the testimony of the trusted support person or, failing this, any other testimony from the family or close friends\". \"Advance directives are binding on the doctor for any decision to carry out an investigation, intervention or treatment, except in the event of a life-threatening emergency, for the time necessary for a full assessment of the situation, and when the advance directives appear manifestly inappropriate or not in keeping with the medical situation\". Some people, including palliative care professionals, stress the variability of wishes and, consequently, the difficulty of interpreting and applying advance directives drawn up in previous circumstances that are far removed from the current end-of-life situation. \"The decision to refuse to apply advance directives that the doctor deems to be manifestly inappropriate or inconsistent with the patient's medical situation is taken at the end of a collegiate procedure defined by regulation and is recorded in the medical record. It is brought to the attention of the trusted support person designated by the patient or, failing that, to the attention of the family or close friends.\n\nThe \"trusted support person\" \"may be a relative, a close friend or the doctor treating the patient\". \"His/her testimony prevails over any other testimony. This designation is made in writing and co-signed by the designated person. It may be reviewed and revoked at any time.\n\nConclusion. Fortunately, the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy limits the will to power that can arise from the implementation of treatments to prolong the life of a person at the end of life, at the cost of objectification, physical and/or moral suffering and disregard for that person's (previous or current) wishes. The right given to people at the end of their lives to ensure that their wishes are respected by means of advance directives rightly reinforces the limits to this abuse.\n\nHowever, the end of life calls for anticipation as much as it resists it. Paradoxically, it is marked by a fear of the future, synonymous with death, and yet by the impossibility of not projecting oneself into the next day, or even the next moment, in the hope of living it as serenely and intensely as possible. From then on, care at the end of life consists of offering, through attentive and solicitous relationships, adaptive, day-to-day support aimed at living in the present, without succumbing to the vain temptation to control the future.\n\n\n''References:''\n\nVan Lander, A.

The Samu has had a call reception and regulation centre (CRRA) with a single national call number since 1978, \"15\", to provide permanent medical assistance. This is known as the Samu-Centre 15.\n\n\n'''Emergency call management:''' The call is initially taken by a '''medical regulation assistant''' (ARM) responsible for identifying the location of the distress, the caller and the nature of the call. The call is then handled by a \"medical regulator (MR)\" who, while questioning the caller and, if possible, the patient himself, will determine the \"need for care and commit the necessary resources\": this is \"act I\" of medical regulation, a telemedicine act recognised by the regulations and the professional orders. The commitment of resources can be made during the dialogue with the caller, as the medical questioning does not delay the intervention of a team, which is activated while the discussion continues. The emergency medical technician also has an \"advisory role\", advising a witness or the patient him/herself on the actions to be taken before the arrival of first aid and/or medical resources: this assistance with actions over the telephone, in which MRAs and emergency medical technicians are trained, is particularly important in the event of a cardiac arrest, for example. The rest of the intervention (\"act II\" of medical regulation) is carried out by the MRAs and the RSMs in order to organise the follow-up to the call and, if necessary, the transport and admission of the patient to a care facility. At this stage, the RSO will be able to advise the teams on site and, above all, direct the patient to the right care.\n\n'''Link to item 17''' Telemedicine, telehealth and telehealth services.\n\n\n'''Les Services Mobiles d'Urgence et de R\u00e9animation (SMUR)''': The mission of the SMUR, triggered by the Samu-Centre 15, is to '''take charge, on the spot, outside the hospital'', of medical distress and provide emergency care before and during transport of the patient to the appropriate establishment, designated by the Samu. SMURs may specialise in transporting children (SMUR P\u00e9diatriques).\n\n\nStructures des urgences (SU)'' : A hospital service, the SU is responsible for ''dealing with unscheduled admissions'' to a public or private health establishment, 24 hours a day, every day of the year, of any unselected person presenting in an emergency situation, including psychiatric emergencies''. Emergency Departments are an essential point of entry into the healthcare system. Reception is formalised around the ''reception organising nurse'' (IOA). The ED is generally organised into care pathways, often with specific premises and staff. The life-saving emergency room deals with serious patients. This is a standard feature of an ED, as is a paediatric care unit. There is usually also a \"short\" rapid care pathway and a \"long\" pathway (patients requiring several additional examinations and hospitalisation).",

Ethics and prenatal diagnosis (PND) ==\nPrenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all \"medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero\". This activity is carried out under the supervision of the Agence de biom\u00e9decine, a public body created by the law of 6 August 2004.\n\nIts main tools are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis or cordocentesis). Faced with the fear that these techniques could be used to satisfy the desire for \"perfect\" children, ethical considerations led the legislator to introduce a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The text of the law as it stood on 6 August 2004 specified the purpose of PND: \"to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child\".\n\nThe application of advances in foetal imaging and human genetics to foetal medicine is highly questionable. Medical genetics initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, with the discovery in 1956 of the existence of a trisomy of chromosome 21 in the cells of patients suffering from the disease then known as \"mongolism\". Gradually, it became possible to harvest foetal cells from pregnant women using the amniocentesis technique. This marked the birth of prenatal diagnosis, first for trisomy 21 and then rapidly for a dozen other chromosomal anomalies. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis then expanded considerably, due in particular to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring of pregnancies, the appearance of biological techniques for analysing serum markers to assess the risk of trisomy 21 and molecular biology techniques.\n\nHowever, as progress in PND is much more rapid than that in therapy, recognising a disease often means realising that there is no treatment available to cure it, leading some couples to request termination of the pregnancy because of a disease that their future child will (perhaps) develop early, but also, in some cases, late after 30, 40 or 50 years.\n\nIt is then up to the CPDPN to interpret the meaning given in practice to \"a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis\" (Public Health Code).\n\nFrance is one of the few countries to authorise IMG \"at any time during pregnancy\" and the legislator, supported by the National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE), has never wished to draw up a list of diseases giving access to IMG, in particular to avoid automatic decision-making (which would not take account of individual situations) and the stigmatisation of a group of people. Indeed, when faced with a request for an IMG, a CPDPN cannot exclude considering the context (the history, culture, representations and convictions of each of the parents), which may lead to different decisions from one couple to another, from one CPDPN to another, for the same pathology. The law therefore leaves a great deal to be decided on a case-by-case basis, and the expression \"particular seriousness\" may be interpreted in different ways by different families and teams. This freedom means that the experience, sensitivity and background of each couple can be taken into account in their decision.\n\nToday, the CPDPNs are faced with certain requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases for which prevention and/or treatment may or may not exist. One example is the case of foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene (which increases the risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer) in families marked by numerous early deaths linked to these diseases. In these situations, requests for IMG have been deemed justified by the family history, which then becomes a criterion of \"particular seriousness\". However, some people question the legitimacy of certain requests.\n\nThe question underlying this whole debate is that of the criteria legitimising a medical decision to terminate a pregnancy. In the case of medical reasons relating to the preservation of the mother's life, there is little debate on this issue, as medicine gives priority to the person \"present\", in this case the mother. On the other hand, in the case of foetal impairment, the underlying issue is a serious one, and ties in with that of the acceptance of disability in our society. Some people, including medical practitioners, although not opposed to abortion, fear that society could slide into a situation where, because there are not enough facilities for the care of disabled children, parents would be encouraged, in an unspoken way, to resort more systematically to abortion. Another question, which is too often avoided by both medical and parental authorities, is: what quality of life can be guaranteed to people whose level of awareness and capacity for autonomy are sometimes difficult to assess?\n\nThe very terms of the law must therefore be questioned in the ethical process of deciding whether or not to terminate a pregnancy:\n\n   - High probability\": you don't have to be 100% sure that a child carrying the mutation will develop a serious disease. Some couples say they don't want to take the slightest risk. But isn't having a child already taking a risk? Others consider that a 25% risk, for example, is acceptable because it means that there is a 75% chance that their baby will be fine. So how we assess the notion of probability depends on each person and their history;\n\n   - incurability\": there may be diseases that are curable but \"disabling\", but behind this handicap, some people put variable notions ranging from \"acceptable\" to \"unbearable\". This involves an assessment of comfort and quality of life. Here again, incurability is a fairly subjective concept whose interpretation can vary from one individual to another;\n\n   - Particular seriousness\": the concept of seriousness also varies greatly from one person to another. What is a serious illness, and for whom? Who decides? Is it serious for the child, for his or her parents, for the doctor, for society? This question arises particularly in the case of diseases that cause intellectual impairment: systematic screening for trisomy 21 is a perfect illustration. When is an illness serious? At birth, in childhood, in adulthood or after the age of 50? How serious is a disease? When it affects a finger, a hand, the whole body, motor functions, cognitive functions? These questions illustrate the density and complexity of the discussions held within the CPDPN. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is necessary, as it is not only their perception of the seriousness of the disease that is at stake, but also their philosophy of life. This dialogue requires a great deal of time and energy on the part of multidisciplinary teams (doctor, geneticist, genetic counsellor, obstetrician, psychologist) whose main role is to support the couple as they work towards a decision.\n\n== B. The specific case of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) ==\nSince 2013, a new screening test for trisomy 21 has gradually come onto the market in France. This is the non-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT), which uses research and analysis of foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood. By simply taking a blood sample from the pregnant woman, this test makes it possible to detect trisomy 21 at a much earlier stage (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea - SA) and with a higher level of performance. The discovery of foetal DNA circulating freely in maternal plasma was described in 1997. Analysis of foetal DNA in maternal blood has already been used for many years in certain antenatal diagnostic indications, such as determining foetal sex in X-linked recessive diseases and genotyping foetal Rhesus D in Rhesus D-negative women. Until 2011, the quality of these techniques meant that they could not be reliably applied to the search for trisomy 21. Today, thanks to advances in new high-throughput sequencing techniques, the screening test for trisomy 21 based on analysis of free foetal DNA in maternal blood has a sensitivity of close to 99.9% and a specificity of 99.8% in high-risk populations.\n\nThis progress is revolutionising the practice of PND insofar as, in addition to trisomy 21, the technique is making it possible to study other characteristics of the foetal genome, with new indications and requests for prescriptions. Current debates are therefore focusing on the conditions of access to this test, not only for trisomy 21, but also for the search for other anomalies (search for risk markers potentially predictive of diseases such as cancers or other pathologies) or access to sex diagnosis.\n\nIt has been proposed that the implementation of the study of foetal DNA in maternal blood should be the subject of applied research, in the field of clinical practice, in order to gain a better understanding of the issues and perceptions of professionals and patients. The preferences of patients and professionals may differ, and the latter may be 'subjected' to the pressure of women's demands.\n\nWill the rules for prescribing these new tests be consensual? Won't the globalisation of access to healthcare and access to e-health via the Internet mean that women will carry out tests on their own, then come back to their doctors with the results and requests for treatment? It will therefore be necessary to assess these attitudes and changes and the nature of the requests, and probably to devise new frameworks and new rules. This will undoubtedly be one of the issues at stake in the forthcoming review of the bioethics laws.\n\nThere is also the question of the impact of this development of the DPNI on requests for terminations of pregnancy. The possibility of carrying out the DPNI test before the end of the first trimester raises a fundamental question: as this test can be carried out at an early stage, even before the first trimester ultrasound, the result can also be given to the patient very quickly, i.e. before the legal term for voluntary termination of pregnancy of 16 SA (weeks of amenorrhoea), potentially allowing direct access to an abortion based, in fact, on this biological result. This development may therefore call into question the spirit of French law, which historically sought to make a clear distinction between two situations: the first, abortion (within a time limit of 16 weeks' gestation) where the woman did not wish to have a child or was unable to welcome one at that point in her life (a situation then described as maternal distress, i.e. with a psycho-social component), and the second, IMG (termination for maternal and/or foetal medical reasons), with no time limit, but currently subject to prior agreement following expertise by a CPDPN reference centre. If the results of the DPNI are communicated to the woman before 16 weeks' gestation and she requests an abortion, the ethical framework of the decision changes completely. Some couples may be tempted to have an abortion, even when the risk of illness has been judged to be low by the doctors or the potential \"anomaly\" to be of little seriousness.\n\nAs far as healthcare professionals are concerned, the future status of the DPNI will undoubtedly need to be clarified so that women are aware of the place it will have in the pregnancy monitoring strategy. To date, some studies show that the number of professionals who do not wish to prescribe this new test at all is low, but that there is a real debate on the legitimate indications and questions associated with its use.\n\n== Key points\n   - PND (prenatal diagnosis) is the set of medical practices designed to detect a serious condition (genetic anomaly, chromosomal abnormality or malformation) in the embryo or foetus in utero, in order to give the future parents the choice of whether or not to terminate the pregnancy and to allow better medical management of the pathology if the pregnancy is continued.\n\n   - When a foetal anomaly is detected, it is up to the CPDPN (multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre) to certify that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition that is incurable at the time of diagnosis. If the pregnant woman so decides, this certificate enables her to terminate her pregnancy on medical grounds.\n\nThe technique of non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) would allow selection of foetal sex or access to genetic screening for markers of pathology or risk at an early stage in pregnancy. It is easy to understand why, while supporting the emergence of NIPT, it may be necessary to target the indications carefully and possibly discuss the timing of the return of results before or after the time limit for voluntary termination of pregnancy.",

Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.\n\n- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics\n\n- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal and cardiac complications.\n<br />\n\n=== '''Indications''' ===\n- Fever: low dose\n\n- Pain:\n\no ''Acute pain'': dental pain, ''postoperative pain'', ''post-traumatic pain'', ''headaches'' or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.\n\no Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.\n\n- inflammation: higher dosage\n\nacute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, ''spinal pain'' and ''radicular pain'' and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.\n\n- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.\n\n\n=== '''Contraindications''' ===\n- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.\n\n- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).\n\n- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).\n\n- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.\n\n- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.\n\n- Haemorrhagic diseases.\n\n- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===\nVirtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's \"terrain\" and any associated medications.\n\n==== 1. Digestive side effects ====\n- frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)\n\n- gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.\n\n- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).\n\nRisk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs\n\n- '''Elderly subject''': age > 65.\n\n- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage or Helicobacter pylori infection.\n\n- Severe co-morbidities.\n\n- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.\n\n- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\n- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n- active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis\n<br />\n\n==== 2.

Cardiovascular complications ====\n- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.\n\n- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.\n\n- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.\n<br />\n\n==== 4.    Allergic complications ====\n- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)\n\n- Bronchospasm\n<br />\n\n==== 5.

For a long time, death was recognised through the inanimate or cold corpse. Then came the notion of death due to cardiac arrest and then encephalic death.\n\nIn 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined this new definition of death as encephalic death, but it was not officially recognised until 1968 in the circular legalising the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the so-called Jeanneney circular).\n\nIt can therefore be said that today there are two ways of being dead, as stated in \"Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes and amending the Public Health Code\".)\n\n# Patient in cardiac arrest (clinical criteria) :\n#* Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation;\n#* Abolition of all brain stem reflexes;\n#* Absence of spontaneous ventilation;\n#* In this case samples must be taken rapidly.\n# Patient in a state of encephalic death:\n#* No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test;\n#* Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation;\n#* In these cases, sampling may be deferred and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state in order to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.\n\nIn this context, it is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:\n\n* people in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I);\n* people in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II);\n* people for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment because of the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III);\n* people who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).\n\nEncephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. In addition, the general public fears that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. So we need to be very clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. We need to listen, explain and support them. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels on this subject: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.\n\n\n'''A special case: organ donation and the medico-legal obstacle'''\n\n* If there is a \"medico-legal obstacle\" at the time of death... this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.\n* BUT :\n** Agreement of the Public Prosecutor+++ (role of the forensic pathologist+++) / The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.\n** The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.\n** The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",

For some of these drugs, use as ''monotherapy'' could be granted at a later stage.\n\n== Mechanisms of action ==\nAnti-epileptic drugs act essentially by ''limiting hyperexcitability'', which favours the triggering of seizures. These effects result in particular from an action on the ''ion channels'' involved in ''hyperexcitability'' or are consecutive to the restoration of the ''GABA / Glutamate balance''.\n\nThere are ''several mechanisms of action'', some of which are common to many anti-epileptic drugs:\n\n* Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels involved in neurotransmission:\n** Blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels is the main mechanism common to many anti-epileptic drugs (valproic acid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, felbamate, topiramate, zonisamide, rufinamide, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine).\n** Blockade of P/Q-type calcium channels (gabapentin, pregabalin), T-type calcium channels (valproic acid, ethosuximide, zonisamide) or potassium channels (levetiracetam) is probably more incidental.\n* Reduction of glutamatergic tone by inhibition of vesiculosynaptic protein 2A (levetiracetam, brivaracetam) or by glutamate receptor antagonism (felbamate, topiramate, perampanel, phenobarbital).\n* Reinforcement of GABAergic tone either directly ('valproic acid', 'gabapentin') or via GABA-A receptor agonists ('phenobarbital', 'benzodiazepines', topiramate'', ''felbamate''), ''GABA transaminase inhibitors'' (vigabatrin, stiripentol) or ''GABA reuptake inhibitors'' (''tiagabine'', ''stiripentol'').\n\nMost drugs are likely to exert an anti-epileptic effect by modulating several targets.\n\n== Indications\nThe choice of treatment takes into account the activity profile of the compound, the syndromic type of epilepsy and any contraindications for the patient. For example, valproic acid is particularly effective in generalised epilepsy, while carbamazepine is most active in partial epilepsy. The prescription of some of these anti-epileptic drugs requires specialised management, particularly when several drugs are combined or when high-risk drugs are prescribed, especially in the case of drug-resistant partial epilepsies or specific epileptic syndromes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|'''Broad-spectrum antiepileptics'''\n\n'''''Generalised and partial epilepsies'''''\n|Narrow-spectrum antiepileptics\n\n'''''Partial epilepsy with or without generalisation'''''\n|-\n|Valproic acid\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\nPerambanel\n\nPhenobarbital\n\nLamotrigine\n\nLevetiracetam\n\nTopiramate\n\nZonisamide\n\nRufinamide\n\nFelbamate\n|Carbamazepine\n\nPhenytoin\n\nGabapentin\n\nPregabalin\n\nLacosamide\n\nOxcarbazepine\n\nEslicarbazepine\n\nTiagabine\n\nVigabatrine\n|}\nBenzodiazepines, in particular clonazepam, are more commonly used on an occasional basis, particularly in the event of status epilepticus. In this particular context, second-line treatments consist of injectable fosphenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbital or levetiracetam.\n\nSome anti-epileptic drugs also have indications in other fields. These include neuropathic pain (pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine), the treatment of migraine (topiramate) and the regulation of mood disorders during bipolar illness (valproic acid, carbamazepine, lamotrigine).\n\n== Undesirable effects and contraindications ==\nAll antiepileptic drugs have dose-dependent effects on the central nervous system (sedation, dizziness, visual disturbances, tremors). They also induce \"cognitive disorders\" and \"psychiatric effects\" (depression, anxiety, psychotic reactions), particularly with levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, vigabatrin and perampanel. It should also be noted that idiosyncratic reactions (skin, hepatitis, bone marrow damage) can sometimes be severe.\n\nWeight gain is reported with several of these drugs (valproic acid, carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, perambanel), while other anti-epileptics (topiramate, zonisamide, felbamate, striripentol, rufinamide) cause weight loss.\n\n''Phenobarbital'', ''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'' and ''valproic acid'' are '''teratogenic''' drugs requiring '''precautions for use''' in '''<u>women of childbearing age</u>'''.\n\n=== Other side effects to consider ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|'''Drug''''\n|Frequent adverse reactions\n|'''Serious adverse reactions'''\n|-\n|Valproic acid\n|Nausea, vomiting, alopecia\n|thrombocytopenia, aplasia, hepatitis, pancreatitis\n|-\n|Carbamazepine\n|Leukoneutropenia, rash\n|Hyperponatremia, BAV, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis\n|-\n|Islicarbazepine\n|Leuconeutropenia\n|Hyponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, agranulocytosis, AVB\n|-\n|Ethosuximide\n|Nausea\n|Bullous rash, agranulocytosis\n|-\n|Felbamate\n|Leukoneutropenia, rash\n|bone marrow aplasia, hepatitis, Lyell's disease\n|-\n|Lacosamide\n|Nausea, vomiting\n|stroke, atrial fibrillation, flutter\n|-\n|Lamotrigine\n|Leukoneutropenia\n|Rash, Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis\n|-\n|Levotetracetam\n|Nausea\n|Hematologic disorders\n|-\n|Oxcarbazepine\n|Nausea, leukoneutropenia\n|Hyperponatremia, rash, Stevens-Johnson, BAV\n|-\n|Phenobarbital\n|Rash\n|Dupuytren's disease, scapulohumeral periarthritis, hepatitis, megaloblastic anaemia\n|-\n|Phenytoin\n|Rash, gingival hypertrophy\n|Stevens-Johnson, hepatitis, pseudo-lymphoma, lupus syndrome\n|-\n|Rufinamide\n|Nausea, vomiting\n|QT depression, hypersensitivity\n|-\n|Topiramate\n|Anorexia, oligohydrosis\n|Renal lithiasis, acidosis, glaucoma\n|-\n|Vigabatrin\n|Digestive disorders\n|Visual field narrowing\n|-\n|Zonisamide\n|Anorexia, oligohydrosis\n|Stevens-Johnson, renal lithiasis, bone marrow aplasia, hyperthermia\n|}\n\n== Drug interactions ==\nAnti-epileptic drugs pose a number of difficulties in terms of ''drug-drug interactions'', as several of them are capable of ''modifying the metabolism of other drugs''. For example, several anti-epileptics (''phenobarbital'', ''carbamazepine'', ''phenytoin'') are '''<u>enzyme inducers</u>'' while valproic acid'' is a '''<u>enzyme inhibitor</u>''' drug.\n\nIn addition to the problem of the interaction of anti-epileptic drugs with other drugs, it is important to stress the \"risk of interaction between anti-epileptic drugs\" leading to a risk of \"ineffectiveness\" or \"toxicity\" by \"reduction\" or \"increase\" of plasma concentrations. Certain combinations are particularly inadvisable, such as the valproic acid/lamotrigine combination (skin toxicity). Finally, it should be noted that phenytoin and stiripentol are metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 respectively, two enzymes which are subject to genetic polymorphism, and are both subject to variability of effect and a significant risk of drug interactions.\n\n== Monitoring methods ==\nThe monitoring of epileptic patients undergoing treatment must take into account ''several dimensions''.\n\n=== Clinical monitoring ===\n\n* The patient's '''overall progress''', '''efficacy''' and '''adverse effects''' of anti-epileptic treatments must be assessed at '''each consultation''' and '''<u>at least once a year</u>''':\n** Nutritional status and measurements (particularly in children) ;\n** The presence/persistence of attacks ;\n** Compliance with treatment and adherence of the carer;\n** The most common co-morbidities: anxiety syndrome, depression, suicidal risk, attention disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders and cognitive disorders;\n** Undesirable effects potentially linked to treatment;\n** Social repercussions.\n* Treatments'' must be ''regularly re-evaluated'' to ensure that patients are not being treated inappropriately (prolonged, unnecessary, ineffective, poorly tolerated or incorrectly dosed treatment).\n* The use of ''tools'' such as a ''crisis monitoring calendar'' to facilitate management is recommended.\n\n=== Biological monitoring ===\n\n* Blood tests for drugs are \"not recommended\" on a \"systematic\" basis and should only be carried out \"if clinically indicated\".\n* Minor asymptomatic biological abnormalities (discreet elevation of transaminases, etc.) are not a formal indication for a change in antiepileptic treatment, but do require biological monitoring.\n* The monitoring of adverse biological reactions must be \"adapted\" according to each antiepileptic drug used and the patient's condition.\n\n=== Electrophysiological monitoring ===\n\n* The ''''EEG can be ''useful'' for the ''follow-up'' and ''monitoring'' under treatment of patients with epilepsy.\n* The frequency with which it is performed depends mainly on the patient's epileptic syndrome.\n\n== Main causes of failure ==\nThere are several reasons for treatment failure:\n\n* Inappropriate drug prescription'' due to a syndromic ''diagnostic error''.\n* Compliance failure'' which can be reduced by therapeutic education'' '''' of the patient and those around him in the context of a complex chronic disease.\n* Occurrence of undesirable effects, the impact of which can be partly limited by \"progressive titration\" (reduction in dose-dependent undesirable effects) and above all by informing the patient in advance and close monitoring.\n* Drug resistance, which potentially affects 20% of patients and requires treatment in an expert centre.",

Article 1 defines palliative care as \"active and continuous care provided by an interdisciplinary team in an institution or at home, [which] aims to relieve pain, alleviate physical suffering, safeguard the dignity of the sick person and support those around them\".\n\n* The law of 4 March 2002, known as the \"Kouchner law\", on patients' rights, places the individual at the centre of the decision-making process concerning him or her. The law stipulates that \"all persons, together with their healthcare professional and taking into account the information and recommendations provided by the latter, make decisions concerning their health\" and specifies that \"no medical procedure or treatment may be carried out without the free and informed consent of the person concerned\". Doctors are also obliged to inform patients about their state of health, treatments and their possible consequences. This law also introduces the possibility of appointing a \"trusted support person\", who must be consulted if the patient is unable to express his or her opinion.\n\n* The law of 22 April 2005, known as the \"L\u00e9onetti law\", relating to patients' rights and the end of life, reaffirms the right of every person \"to refuse or not to receive treatment\" or not to refuse unreasonable obstinacy. It recognises the possibility for doctors, in the name of the same principle, to limit or stop care and/or to apply a treatment that may have the secondary effect of shortening life, if they \"establish that they cannot relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease\" (this is known as the double effect), provided that they inform the patient, the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, one of the next of kin. It gives these people the right to request that their treatment be limited or stopped, and obliges doctors to respect their wishes \"after informing them of the consequences of their choice\". It states that any person of legal age may \"draw up advance directives in the event that he or she should one day be unable to express his or her wishes\", which \"indicate the person's wishes regarding the conditions for limiting or stopping treatment at the end of his or her life\". The doctor must take these into account when making any decision \"provided that they were drawn up less than three years before the person became unconscious\".\n\n* The law of 2 February 2016, known as the \"Claeys-L\u00e9onetti law\", creates new rights for patients and people at the end of life. If the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, the law requires the doctor to \"ascertain the patient's expressed wishes\" (art. 10), in particular through the use of advance directives and the trusted support person where these exist.\tIt introduces the right to \"deep and continuous sedation\" for a patient suffering from a serious and incurable disease, when \"their vital prognosis is at risk in the short term [and they] are experiencing suffering that is refractory to treatment\", or when their decision to stop treatment \"involves their vital prognosis in the short term and is likely to result in unbearable suffering\". Deep and continuous sedation is the name given to the care process that consists of using medication to relieve pain. It involves a reduction or loss of the patient's consciousness. Under this law, euthanasia and assisted suicide remain prohibited in France.\n\nThe law thus makes it possible to respond to two medical situations: limiting care and stopping care. Both are designed to avoid unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n* Limitation means refraining from using means likely to prolong a life that is in serious danger. This means not undertaking certain life-prolonging treatments which are technically possible but which do not aim to improve the patient's condition;\n* Withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment: this is the suspension of life-sustaining treatment in progress, for example artificial respiration.\n\nIn all cases, the issue of information and consent is central. A decision may or may not be taken at the patient's request, and it is essential to know the patient's feelings and last wishes. Two situations must be distinguished and discussed:\n\n* When the patient has made a request or is able to take part in the discussion with the team;\n* When the patient has not expressed anything, or can no longer express anything, and the request comes from relatives (questioning the patient's wishes and challenging the concept of autonomy).\n\nWhen patients are unconscious or have reduced capacity for expression and comprehension, incorporating the patient's opinion and consent into decision-making is highly problematic. There are several possible approaches:\n\n* Advance directives are a way for mentally competent people, who have lost their capacity to express themselves, to establish in advance and in writing how they would like to be treated in the event of hospitalisation. Among other things, they can concern end-of-life decisions, meaning that the person can specify the type of decision they would like to be made. But it is still rare for patients to write one;\n* The testimony of relatives or the trusted support person: this testimony is necessary, but it raises questions (which relatives? how reliable? how hierarchical are these relatives?).\n\nIn all cases, by law and in accordance with good professional practice, healthcare professionals have a duty to act collegially. The limitation or cessation of treatment cannot be carried out unless a collegial procedure has been followed between professionals and the patient's advance directives have been taken into account (if they exist) or the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, a close relative has been consulted.\n\nEach stage of the reasoned decision to limit or stop treatment must be recorded in the medical record.\n\n== II- Place and role of the trusted support person at the end of life ==\nIn addition to optimising the patient's right to information, other rights have led to the introduction of new practices to improve the relationship between carers and patients.\n\nThe right to appoint a trusted support person was enshrined in the French Public Health Code following the law of 4 March 2002.\n\nFor a long time, healthcare teams have been concerned to see how a person close to the patient, as a third party and mediator, can help to build links in the care process and give the patient a voice, particularly when the patient is unable or unwilling to take part in the decision alone. This reflection led to the introduction of the concept of the \"trusted support person\" in the \"health democracy\" law of 4 March 2002.\n\nThe role of the trusted support person, in its original sense, is to assist the patient in his or her care, to support him or her physically and/or psychologically and to act as a link with the medical teams. In other words, they support the patient's day-to-day care, choices and decisions.\n\nThis primary role deserves to be emphasised because, sometimes, the trusted support person is still only perceived as an interlocutor in major crisis situations, such as, for example, stopping or limiting care at the end of life or the question of post-mortem organ removal; situations in which the trusted support person has to testify to the patient's wishes. The role of the trusted support person is to provide support during the course of standard care.\n\n== III- Drawing up end-of-life advance directives ==\nThe law of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life introduced the possibility of refusing care if it appears to be \"useless, disproportionate or having no effect other than the artificial maintenance of life\". This refusal takes the form of stopping or limiting curative or palliative care, resulting in the patient's death in the more or less short term. This approach, authorised by law, has been described as a \"right to die\". Law no. 2016-87 of 2 February 2016, known as the \"end of life\" law, is a development of the 2005 law and strengthens the rights of patients at the end of life, and specifies the important role that advance directives can play.\n\nIn an end-of-life situation, in ethical terms, the decisive factor is the patient's degree of autonomy of thought, which is the true criterion for qualifying his or her ability to develop a coherent and considered argument in the face of such a decision.\n\nIn practice, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1) If the patient is aware and capable of taking part in a deliberative process, supported by the acquisition of sufficient knowledge about their illness and how it is progressing (transmitted by the doctor), they will be involved in this decision. The doctor and patient then engage in a complex and intimate exchange in which the patient expresses his inability to fight any further and his wish not to prolong his life. In this way, a dialogue can be established which, over time, can confirm the legitimacy and reality of a request to end life. The doctor can then act on the request, following in-depth discussion and reflection with the patient.\n\n2) For patients who are unable to express their wishes, there is a broad consensus on the importance of seeking their opinion so that it can be included in the decision. This is why the 2005 law states that \"when a person, in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease, whatever the cause, is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, the doctor may decide to limit or stop treatment that is useless or incapable of improving the patient's condition, after respecting the collegial procedure and consulting the trusted support person, the family and, where appropriate, the patient's advance directives\". To come closer to respecting the patient's wishes, the concept of testifying to what the person would have wished is used here. This testimony may be given in writing by the patient (advance directives), or verbally by those close to the patient, in particular the trusted support person (if the patient has designated one).\n\nThe principle of advance directives originated in the United States, also known as living wills, at the end of the 1960s, to enable patients' opinions to be incorporated into the end-of-life decision-making process. In 1990, the Patient Self Determination Act, passed by the US Congress, made it compulsory for patients to be informed of these advance directives on admission to all hospitals. It also obliges professionals to systematically check whether or not their patients have drawn up such documents, and to indicate this in their medical records.  In France, a survey in 2000 revealed that only 6% of patients undergoing life-sustaining treatment (LATA) in intensive care had advance directives or had designated a contact person (equivalent to a trusted support person) authorised to represent them. This is why the 2005 law introduced this system, with the aim of ensuring that professionals offer it to patients, without imposing it, and are obliged to find out whether any directives have been drawn up when they decide to stop or limit treatment.\n\nThe changes made to the law in 2016 were necessary to reiterate that refusing any treatment at the end of life is the patient's right and that his or her wishes must be respected. This is why the aim was to strengthen and clarify the role of advance directives. It should be emphasised that, from now on, this law will establish a hierarchy in terms of the ways in which a patient's wishes can be traced: firstly, the advance directives, then failing that, the testimony of the trusted support person, and failing that, any other testimony from the family or close friends.\n\nBut questions remain, particularly when patients have not drawn up advance directives, or when these are not adapted to the clinical situation, or when a trusted support person has not been designated, or when relatives disagree. In all these situations, teams must continue to work towards dialogue and ethical discussion in the name of the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence.  \n\n\n\n'''What the law on the end of life emphasises:'''\n\n- The idea is for all professionals to be able to discuss this law on the end of life, advance directives and their place in relation to the trusted support person, at the appropriate time, depending on how the illness is progressing, with their patients.\n\n- An obligation on healthcare professionals to use all the means at their disposal to ensure that every person has the right to a dignified end of life accompanied by the best possible alleviation of suffering.\n\n- Recognition of a patient's right to stop or limit treatment as part of the refusal of unreasonable obstinacy.\n\n- An obligation for the doctor to respect the patient's wish to refuse or not to receive treatment, after informing the patient of the consequences of his or her choices and their seriousness.\n\n- A greater role for doctors in informing patients about the possibility of drawing up advance directives and/or appointing a trusted support person.\n\n- The need for collegial decision-making.\n\n- The fact that the advance directives enshrined in the law are now enforceable, meaning that the referring doctors of an unconscious patient must follow the perspectives written in this document if they are appropriate to the medical situation.\n\n- The fact that there is a hierarchy concerning the means of tracing a patient's wishes: first of all the advance directives, then failing that the testimony of the trusted support person, then failing that any other testimony from the family or close friends.

In clinical practice, we sometimes experience the difficulty of providing information, particularly when faced with highly distressed patients, where the truth is difficult to tell and some patients are unable to bear it. Some former doctors used to quote St Thomas to justify not informing a patient: \"Man prefers a lie to the truth. Man prefers a lie to the truth that enlightens\". But apart from exceptional cases, this type of approach is a thing of the past. We believe that every patient has the right to know, so that they can participate in the organisation of their care pathway, but also so that they can organise their lives accordingly, in terms of both day-to-day aspects and fundamental choices. Providing information is a complex process but, like any medical skill, it can be learned. This learning process includes both the way in which the information is delivered and the way in which the patient is supported during the process, with a humanistic and psychological approach.\n\nThe law gives this development an additional dimension by placing information and consent within a contractual framework designed to assess the quality of medical practice, particularly in the event of conflict. Questions of the quality and completeness of information are part of this framework.\n\nHowever, a rare case should be mentioned: the wish not to know. This may constitute an exception to the patient's duty to inform if he or she has clearly expressed (data and arguments which must be noted in the medical record) the wish to be kept in the dark about a serious diagnosis or prognosis, or even about any information concerning his or her health and treatment. However, legal and ethical rules specify that this exception does not apply when third parties are exposed to a risk of contamination. This clarification, inspired by the case of AIDS, applies to all serious contagious diseases and is necessary because of the patient's responsibility towards others and in the interests of public health.\n\n== How far to inform: the question of serious or exceptional risks'' ==\nTwo types of situation may arise in medical practice, depending on whether or not there is a choice between different diagnostic and/or therapeutic hypotheses.\n\nIn the (most frequent) case where a treatment recognised and validated by medicine is proposed to the exclusion of all other options, the primary aim of the information provided is not to make a therapeutic choice (unless the patient opts to refuse treatment). The aim is to explain in an \"intelligible\" way the merits of the proposal put forward, in order to obtain the patient's assent and, where appropriate, any reservations he or she may have, to enable him or her to seek any help he or she may need and to organise his or her life accordingly. This is information of a medical and social nature, prior to acceptance (or refusal) of the proposed treatment, with the aim of health education to improve compliance with prescriptions and optimise the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nIn the case of diagnostic or therapeutic alternatives, on the other hand, information is part of a process of choice where, in theory, after being informed, the patient can opt for one proposal rather than another.\n\nHow far should we go in providing information? Should we talk about all the risks, including those of death linked to a treatment or those whose occurrence is exceptional?\n\nThe answers lie in the development of the legal rules governing the provision of information to a patient. Several criteria have been established to define the contractual framework between a doctor and his patient:\n\n* the capacity of persons to contract with each other (qualified doctor, registered with the Conseil de l'ordre on the one hand; patient, of legal age, legally capable on the other);\n* quality criteria concerning the commitment of the professional (obligation to use reasonable means, respect for professional secrecy, etc.) and of the patient (compliance with prescriptions and monitoring rules);\n* a lawful cause for the medical action: a clear and legitimate medical aim justifying the medical action that affects the patient's integrity;\n* consent must be obtained after the patient has been provided with quality information, without pressure, i.e. informed and free consent.\n\nIn this legal approach, information and consent become one of the criteria for the validity of a contract.\n\nWith regard to the characteristics of this information, on 21 December 1961 the Civil Division of the Court of Cassation emphasised that it should be \"simple, approximate, intelligible and fair\". Since 1995, article 35 of the Code of Medical Ethics has stipulated that:\n\n''\" The doctor owes the person he is examining, treating or advising fair, clear and appropriate information'' about his ''condition, the investigations and care he is proposing''. Throughout the course of the illness, he shall take account of the patient's personality in his explanations and ensure that they are understood\".\n\nWe note that the terms \"simple\" and \"approximate\" have disappeared, reflecting a desire to be more rigorous in the approach and rejecting excessive simplicity or approximation. As far as risks are concerned (bearing in mind that all medical procedures and prescriptions, even the most routine, involve them), the information must include them insofar as they are normally foreseeable.\n\nWith regard to the concepts of rarity and severity of the risk, in 2000 the Conseil d'\u00c9tat (an administrative court that rules on disputes involving public hospitals) stated that the mere fact that risks occur only exceptionally does not relieve the practitioner of his obligation, and that when a medical act entails a risk of death or invalidity the patient must be informed, even if this is exceptional.\n\nThese developments led to the law of 4 March 2002, which stipulates that all frequent or serious risks that are normally foreseeable must be brought to the patient's attention before a procedure is carried out, but also \"a posteriori\" (i.e. in the short, medium and long term), if new consequences and risks are identified.\n\n''\" Everyone has the right to be informed about their state of health. This information concerns the various investigations, treatments or preventive measures proposed, their usefulness, any urgency, their consequences, the frequent or serious risks normally foreseeable which they entail, as well as the other possible solutions and the foreseeable consequences in the event of refusal. When, after the investigations, treatments or preventive actions have been carried out, new risks are identified, the person concerned must be informed, unless it is impossible to trace him or her\". Law of 4 March 2002''\n\n== Rules and criteria for assessing the quality of the information provided ==\nAll healthcare professionals have a duty to provide information within the scope of their competence and in compliance with the professional rules applicable to them. The only exceptions to this duty are in cases of urgency or where it is impossible to provide information. This information is provided during an individual interview, as part of a dialogue. The purpose of the information is twofold:\n\n* respect patients' autonomy of choice by giving them all the information they need to make an informed decision, i.e. to consent to the proposed treatment;\n\n* to provide them with all the information they need to take part in their care and receive all the advice and assistance they need to organise their lives.\n\nThis information is provided first and foremost to the patient. If the patient so wishes (i.e. with his or her consent, so as not to breach medical confidentiality without his or her knowledge), it can be given in the presence of a close relative or a trusted person. However, to ensure that the patient remains free to talk about matters that he or she would not wish to discuss in the presence of a third party, it is important to suggest that the interview should initially be an individual one, and that the third party should only be invited secondarily. In the case of minors and patients who are unable to reach the age of majority, information is provided to their parents or legal representatives, but without excluding the patient from access to information. As soon as their age and situation allow, patients must themselves receive information adapted to their degree of maturity. In the case of minors, as far as possible, the information is given to the two holders of parental authority. If only one is present, the healthcare professional will explain the need to inform the other, whether or not the couple are separated. In situations where the prognosis or risk is serious, it is preferable to have an interview with both parents.\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the provision of information must comply with certain rules of good practice: it must be based on complete, validated data that is up to date with advances in medicine and science (in practice, this means that the data must be up to date); it must be understandable to everyone (avoiding medical-technical formulations that are the domain of professional terms and skills); and finally, in terms of content, it must meet five essential points, which must be addressed and discussed with every patient and their representative: the aims of the medical approach, its advantages and disadvantages, its risks, as well as the risks of not implementing it, the constraints generated and the impact on daily life, possible help and support: social rights, help (professional and/or associative) to facilitate the person's progress through the care pathway and their daily life.\n\n== The place of the written word and the issue of traceability of information and consent ==\nIn practice, as far as the form is concerned, the information must remain above all oral''''''''. It may be aided by the provision of appropriate educational information documents to the patient. Apart from specific cases provided for by law (organ donation from a living person, biomedical research, genetic studies, medically assisted procreation, refusal of care, etc.), the information document is not a document intended to collect signed written consent. Its sole purpose is to provide patients with information that will enable them to come back to it once they have returned to their room or home and to ask any questions they may have.\n\nThe information document must meet the same quality criteria as those mentioned above. In addition, it is recommended that information documents should be drawn up by a collegiate body, within learned medical societies or healthcare groups and institutions, tested on patients and validated with user representatives. The advantage of consensual information of this kind is that it produces a benchmark drawn up by experts.\n\nThese documents should encourage patients to ask doctors any questions they may have. They can be enhanced with visual aids or linked to websites with animated diagrams or videos. They should be translated or explained in the patient's own language.\n\nAnother medico-legal issue concerns the traceability of the information provided, i.e. the elements that make it possible, in the event of a dispute, to prove that the patient has been properly informed. On 25 February 1997, a ruling by the French Supreme Court, known as the \"H\u00e9dreul ruling\" - named after the patient concerned - quashed and annulled the judgement of a Court of Appeal concerning a colonoscopy with removal of a polyp, following which the patient had suffered an intestinal perforation, the risk of which he claimed he had not been informed. Initially, the Court of Appeal dismissed the case, ruling that the patient had to prove that the doctor had not warned him. In its ruling, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed that doctors have a specific obligation to inform their patients; it also stated that it is now up to the doctor to prove that he has fulfilled this obligation (creating what has been called a reversal of the burden of proof, which no longer lies with the patient). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the Court takes into account the reality of the consultation process, specifying that the methods of proof remain unrestricted and that, according to its ruling of 14 October 1997, information may be proven by any means, except in cases where a special legal provision imposes a particular method of proof (such as written consent, for example, in medical research, or for organ removal from living donors).\n\nSince this decision, we have seen the development of brochures or information sheets on examinations and treatments. However, it should be remembered that these documents, although recommended, and even if some have patients sign them, do not free doctors and healthcare structures from other approaches. The quality of the information provided covers other aspects, which will also be taken into account in the event of a dispute. The following will be taken into account: consultation times, information meetings organised by healthcare structures, brochures given to patients, letters exchanged between doctors (in particular with the general practitioner) with copies given to patients, elements of the medical file given to patients.\n\nIt is important that all these information sessions are recorded in the medical record (by whom, in whose presence, on what date), together with any difficulties encountered in providing them. It is also important to mention any situations in which it was impossible or complex to obtain information, and to justify this on the basis of the patient's clinical and social situation.\n\nIt is therefore important not to forget that a written document does not free the doctor from all the other means of information that he or she may deem necessary, and in particular that the oral time spent with the patient is of major importance.",

It prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, reduces the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors, leading to increased uptake of LDL lipoproteins by hepatocytes.\n*Ezetimibe*: reduces the absorption of enterocyte cholesterol (after binding to NPC1L1 (\"Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1\") and SR-BI (\"scavenger receptor class B type 1\") and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors.\n*PCSK9 (pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors: promote renewal of hepatic LDL receptors\n\n===Hypotriglyceridemics===\n\n*Fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil): PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) alpha receptor agonists, they reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase lipolysis, triglyceride catabolism, HDL production and their return to the liver.\n*Omega 3 fatty acids: reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase triglyceride catabolism\n\n==Indications==\nThe prescription of a hypolipidemic drug is always preceded by 3 to 6 months (primary prevention) or associated (secondary prevention) with a phase of hygiene and dietary measures.\n\n===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===\n\n*Statins: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia alone or in combination\n*Resin: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination\n*Ezetimibe: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination\n*PCK9 inhibitor (rank B): severe hypercholesterolaemia (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or homozygous hypercholesterolaemia justifying LDL apheresis), secondary prevention if LDL-C > 0.70 g/L under maximum tolerated lipid-lowering treatment after request for prior agreement.\n\n===Hypotriglyceridemics===\n\n*Fibrates: alone in the case of isolated hypertriglyceridaemia (> 5g/L), possibly (fenofibrate) combined with a statin in the case of mixed hyperlipidaemia.\n*Omega-3 fatty acids: in combination with a fibrate if ineffective.\n\n==Undesirable Effects==\n\n===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===\n\n*Statins: myalgias (\u00b1 increase in CPK), very rare rhabdomyolysis (increased risk with inhibitors of the cytochromes involved in their metabolism, such as macrolides including clarythromycin and erythromycin (A, P, S), azole antifungals (A, S)) and increased transaminases (discontinue if > 3*N).

GnRH stimulates the anteropituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). The appearance of this pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, in particular leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status and intercurrent pathologies.\n\nIn boys, FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume, while LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (penis, hair) as well as musculoskeletal changes.\n\nIn girls, LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens, which cause mammary, uterovaginal and OGE development, followed by the appearance of the first menstrual periods (menarche).\n\nPubic hair is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.\n\nThe increase in sex hormones increases the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, and the speed of statural growth accelerates (pubertal growth peak).",

Physical activity in childhood therefore partly determines the health of future adults.\n\nInvolving children in competitions allows them to develop their social interactions and to test themselves against others, and is a vehicle for motivation and progress.\n\n\nAt any age, the risks of practising sport are :\n\n- Mainly cardiovascular.\n\nWhile regular physical activity has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, the fact remains that cardiovascular risk is transiently increased during intense physical exercise (increased cardiac output and arterial pressure during exercise), compared with the situation at rest.\n\nThis is why the [[Knowing the main causes of contraindications to practising sport 2C-256-DE-A01|main contraindications to practising sport]] are cardiovascular, and why [[Knowing how to conduct a medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport in adults 2C-256-PC-B01|the medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport]] focuses on the cardiovascular system.\n\n- Traumatic, depending on the type of sporting activity.",

Active on the liver, reduces hepatic glucose production, in particular hepatic gluconeogenesis (uncertain effect on the intestine). Frequent digestive side effects. Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and <u>formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min</u>. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.\n\n* Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides (sulphonylureas): Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc). They are associated with '''glinides''' (<u>repaglinide</u>) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: <u>hypoglycaemia</u> and weight gain [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics variable depending on the molecule and <u>therefore variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides</u>. <u>No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.</u>\n\n* '''Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (colloquially DPP4, family: \"gliptins\").''' Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). <u>Posology to be adjusted to renal function.</u> Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.\n\n* '''GLP1 receptor agonists (colloquially GLP1 agonists).''' Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. <Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia.</u> Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.\n\n* '''Intestinal alphaglucosidase inhibitor,''' only representative: <u>acarbose</u>. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.\n\n* '''SGLT2 inhibitors.''' Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. <u>Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects [[Adult heart failure]] [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]</u>. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation.

This is the case for adults (tendinopathies, fatigue fractures, etc.) and children.\n\nThe main pathologies in children appear during growth peaks, at a time when the conjugation cartilages are particularly active. This pain around the growth plate is known as osteochondrosis, and is due to disturbances in ossification and is linked to the mechanical factors generated by sporting movements: tendon traction on the apophyseal cores, impact on the growth plate, shearing of the epiphyseal growth plates. The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.\n\n\nThe two most frequent locations are :\n\n- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease.\n\nAppears most frequently around the age of 9-10.\n\n- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease.\n\nA common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.\n\n\nThese pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localised in the growth plate.

In this situation, it can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided that it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and must demonstrate that it has identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator. This is demonstrated in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may, however, contain excipients that are different from those of the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, colour and taste of a generic drug may also be different from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.\n\n==Authorisation of generic medicinal products ==\nGeneric medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. In practice, marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine on the basis of the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. The latter type of study must be randomised, cross-over and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin (medicines for which a small variation in concentration will modify the effect of the medicine), the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.\n\n==''Substitution of a generic drug'''==\nGeneric drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.\n\nAs prescriptions must be in INN, the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine are authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic.\n\nThe prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must take account of the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:\n\n*In particular, if the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.\n*If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without an excipient with a notorious effect should be prescribed/dispensed.\n\n==Refusal to substitute ==\nUnder very specific conditions, requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, he/she must write \"non-substitutable\" on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in 3 situations:\n\n*Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.\n*Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product in the event that this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.\n*Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.\n\nPharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled \"non-substitutable\" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.\n\n==''Biosimilar medicinal product'''==\nA biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, the complexity of the molecule and the difficulty involved in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.\n\n==Authorisation of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBiosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.\n\nIf a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g. marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).\n\n==Interchangeability of biosimilar medicinal products ==\nBy definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment, but requires: informing the patient and obtaining his or her consent; recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file; and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",

Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries. The \"social assistance logic\" allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (for example, in the context of what are known as minimum social benefits, such as the revenu de solidarit\u00e9 active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicap\u00e9 [AAH] or the fonds de solidarit\u00e9 vieillesse [FSV]). '''The logic of universal protection''' covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits). The ''individual protection logic'' is based on savings (e.g. the decision to buy dental implants) and private insurance, while ''collective protection'' is based on the pooling of risks.",

These contributions are for health, maternity, disability and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the \"contribution solidarit\u00e9 autonomie\" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.\n\nSocial security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favour of fiscal resources, on the one hand the CSG (general social contribution), and on the other hand exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include: transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme); taxes on products (taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance, etc.); taxes on wages and labour; taxes on income and wealth: this is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG, plus the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS). State public contributions'' finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidise schemes.\n\nGraph 1: Origin of social protection resources (pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners).<gallery>\nFile:Item 19 Fig 1.png\n</gallery>Source: DREES.

It is passed each year by parliament, following a government bill[1].   \n\nThe Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It \"aims to control social and health spending\". It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.\n\nIt should be emphasised that this is a ''financing law'' rather than a ''finance law'', which clearly indicates that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control therefore remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorise the collection of revenue, it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.\n\nThe LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days, otherwise the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.\n\nSince 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.\n\nExamples of new measures include extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days; increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD); funding expenditure on tests, vaccines and masks to respond to the health crisis; and creating a 5th branch of social security to support independent living.\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.gouvernement.fr/presentation-du-projet-de-loi-de-financement-de-la-securite-sociale-2022</nowiki>",

Infant formulas are continued until the age of 10-12 months, when they are replaced by infant formulas or growing-up milks.
