**Title:** Knowing the Main Principles of Pleural Drainage and Its Indications  
**Rubric:** Management  

**Pleural Drainage Indications:**

- Consider pleural drainage when:
  - The pneumothorax is primary and exsufflation has failed.
  - The pneumothorax is secondary and the pleural breach is expected to take time to close.

**General Guidelines:**

- Ensure compliance with surgical asepsis rules.
- Inform the patient in advance.
- Provide adequate anxiolysis and analgesia.
- Administer oxygen therapy if necessary.
- Position the patient supine, with the hand on the same side as the pneumothorax placed above the head to clear the axillary region if the approach is via the axilla.

**Techniques for Pleural Drainage:**

1. **Percutaneous Technique:**
   - Placement of a pigtail drain using Seldinger's method, with anatomical landmarks similar to pleural exsufflation (midclavicular line at the level of the 2nd intercostal space).
   - Connect the drain to a suction system set between -5 and -20 cm H2O.
   - If successful, monitor with short-term hospitalization or as an outpatient with a closed tap for secondary drainage in case of recurrence.
   - If unsuccessful, proceed with the surgical technique.

2. **Surgical Technique:**
   - Indications include pneumothorax that is difficult to drain or associated with fluid effusion (e.g., fistulized pulmonary abscess).
   - Two approaches:
     - Anterior approach using the same landmarks as pleural exsufflation (midclavicular line at the 2nd intercostal space).
     - Axillary approach (upper edge of the lower rib, between the posterior edge of the pectoralis major and the anterior edge of the dorsalis major, at the level of the 4th or 5th intercostal space, marked by the nipple line).
   - Introduce a pleural drain through a trocar with a foam mandrel and connect to a suction system set at -5 to -20 cm H2O.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Partial pneumothoraxes may require unconventional landmarks, guided by imaging.
- A chest X-ray is usually sufficient to monitor the drain position and lung reattachment.

**Figures:**

- **Figure 1:** Example of a percutaneous drainage set. The guide is inserted through the needle used for puncture. After dilation on the guide, the drain is inserted percutaneously and connected to the suction system.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions:**

- **Standard Chest X-ray:**
  - A fine linear opacity represents the outer edge of the visceral pleura, separated from the wall by hyperclarity with the disappearance of the vascular network (clear peripheral crescent). When the pneumothorax is small, it is only visible at the apex.
  - Sign of tension pneumothorax includes retraction of the lung parenchyma onto its hilum, flattening of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome, and pushing of the mediastinum towards the opposite side.
  - Possible indirect signs include subcutaneous emphysema with air under the skin and pneumomediastinum.
  - If there is an associated fluid effusion, a horizontal hydroaerobic level (hydropneumothorax) is visible on the X-ray taken in the standing position.
  - Incomplete pneumothorax with apical, inferior, or anterior detachment may show a hyperclaric line on the cardiac silhouette or on the diaphragmatic dome.

- **Scanner:**
  - Not systematic.
  - Used to confirm pneumothorax if there is any doubt and/or to specify its topography to guide any drainage in the event of partial detachment. It is also carried out in the event of recurrent pneumothorax to search for an anomaly in the underlying lung parenchyma.

**Definitions**  
Exsufflation is performed in two circumstances:  

- Pressure pneumothorax with signs of severity  
- Complete pneumothorax with a detachment of more than 2 cm  

**Procedure for Major Emergency**  
In the event of a major emergency (signs of poor respiratory and/or hemodynamic tolerance), the following steps should be taken:  

- Respect the rules of surgical asepsis.  
- Perform puncture using a large-bore catheter.  
- Insert in the 2nd intercostal space via an anterior approach on the midclavicular line.  
- Follow the upper edge of the lower side along a vertical path.  
- Success is confirmed by the sound of ""pchit"" (evacuation of pressurized air) and immediate clinical improvement.  
- Simultaneously, provide the patient with oxygen therapy, volume expansion to combat de-escalation, and often analgesia.  

**Indications for Large Spontaneous Complete Pneumothorax**

Functional renal failure corresponds to a state of true or effective hypovolemia, which is a frequent situation.

- **True Hypovolemia:**
  - Arterial hypotension: extracellular dehydration (weight loss, skin folds) or overall dehydration, hemorrhage.
  - Before the hypotension stage: look for orthostatic hypotension.

- **Effective Hypovolemia:** Situations where renal perfusion pressure is low without true hypovolemia:
  - Major edematous states during hypoproteinemia (nephrotic syndrome, hepatocellular insufficiency, malnutrition), cirrhosis with edemato-ascitic decompensation, total or right heart failure.
  - Septic, anaphylactic, or cardiogenic shock in the initial phase.
