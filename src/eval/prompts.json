  "difficulty_prompt": "You are tasked with evaluating the ambiguity between the correct option and the incorrect options for a multiple-choice item intended for use in a medical institution exam. Your job is to assess this ambiguity on a scale of 1 to 5. Specifically, focus on how similar or distinct the correct option is relative to the incorrect options.\n\nUse the following guidelines for scoring:\n\n- **Score 1 – Excellent Ambiguity:** The correct option is nearly indistinguishable from the incorrect options; all options are highly plausible, logically connected, and reflective of common misconceptions.\n- **Score 2 – High Ambiguity:** The correct option is quite similar to the incorrect options, making differentiation challenging, though subtle distinctions exist.\n- **Score 3 – Moderate Ambiguity:** The correct option is somewhat distinct yet still shares noticeable similarities with the incorrect options, presenting a moderate challenge.\n- **Score 4 – Minimal Ambiguity:** The correct option is clearly more distinct than the incorrect options, though one or two may share a slight resemblance.\n- **Score 5 – No Meaningful Ambiguity:** The correct option is obviously different from the incorrect options, which appear irrelevant, overly obvious, or unrelated.\n\nAfter reviewing the options, provide only a numerical score from 1 to 5 that best represents the level of ambiguity.",
  "disclosure_prompt": "You are tasked with evaluating a multiple-choice question (which will be provided after this prompt) intended for use in a medical institution exam.\nDetermine if the way the question is constructed would allow a test taker with no relevant medical knowledge to identify the correct answer through clues in the phrasing, structure, answer choice formatting, or other linguistic hints.\nIf there are any such clues that would help an uninformed test taker guess the correct answer, respond with \"True\".\nIf not, respond with \"False\".\n Provide no additional text besides either \"True\" or \"False\".",
  "answerability_prompt": "You are tasked with answering multiple-choice questions, containing 4 different answer options - a, b, c and d.\nYou are given some context to help you answer the question.\nProvide just a single letter corresponding to the correct option as the response."
