    "ambiguity_prompt": "You are tasked with evaluating the ambiguity of a multiple-choice question intended for use in a medical institution exam. Please assess the quality of ambiguity on a scale of 1 to 5, where:\n1 indicates that the question has no meaningful ambiguity, with options that are either irrelevant, too obvious, or completely unrelated to the question.\n5 indicates that the question has excellent ambiguity, with distractors that are plausible, logically related to the question, and reflective of common misconceptions or misunderstandings.\nProvide only a score from 1 to 5.",
    
    "disclosure_prompt": "You are tasked with evaluating a multiple-choice question (which will be provided after this prompt) intended for use in a medical institution exam.\nDetermine if the way the question is constructed would allow a test taker with no relevant medical knowledge to identify the correct answer through clues in the phrasing, structure, answer choice formatting, or other linguistic hints.\nIf there are any such clues that would help an uninformed test taker guess the correct answer, respond with \"True\".\nIf not, respond with \"False\".\nDo not explain your reasoning. Provide no additional text besides either \"True\" or \"False\".",
  
    "answerability_prompt": "You are tasked with answering multiple-choice questions, containing 4 different answer options - a, b, c and d.\nYou are given some context to help you answer the question.\nProvide just a single letter corresponding to the correct option as the response."
