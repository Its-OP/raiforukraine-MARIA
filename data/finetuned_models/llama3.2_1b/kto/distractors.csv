Finally, in the event of polypathology causing a disabling condition and requiring continuous care for a foreseeable period of more than 6 months, an exemption from co-payment may be granted for care in accordance with the disabling polypathology protocol (32nd disease). To establish an ALD care protocol, the attending physician accompanies the patient's request. In consultation with the specialists involved, the physician draws up the care protocol, which sets out the diagnostic elements, prescribed treatments, specialist consultations, or paraclinical examinations necessary for the patient's care. The care protocol must comply with HAS recommendations and receive the opinion of the health insurance medical officer. A copy of the care protocol is given to the patient, who reads it, signs it, and is free to accept or refuse that the diagnosis of the disease be included. Each doctor who provides care to this patient, whether in a hospital or in a healthcare establishment, is required to write prescriptions on a bizone prescription to distinguish prescriptions relating to the ALD (exemption from co-payment) from those relating to other conditions (application of co-payment). The patient benefits from direct access to the specialists mentioned in the care protocol. In return for the advantage of exemption from co-payment, patients are obliged to present their personal section of the care protocol to all professionals they consult, except in emergencies.

The growth in social protection expenditure is linked to employment support measures as a result of the introduction of short-time working.

Old-age and survivors' benefits have slowed down since the introduction of four major reforms to the pension system in 1993, 2003, 2008, and 2010: 
1. Indexation of pensions to inflation rather than wages.
2. Calculation of pensions based on the best 25 years instead of the best 10 in the private sector.
3. Increase in the number of years needed to qualify for the full rate.
4. Increase in the legal age for entitlement from 60 to 62.","The average amount of pensions is inevitably increasing in social protection for several reasons:
1. The rise in real wages over the generations.
2. The retirement of baby-boomers, who outnumber current generations.
3. Longer life expectancy.","Regarding health risk, the rate of increase in expenditure has been slowed since the 1980s by several reform plans: 
1. 1982-1983: Reduction in the reimbursement of certain drugs.
2. 1986 and 1993: Increased the proportion of expenditure to be borne by households.
3. 1996: Introduction of the national target for health insurance expenditure (Ondam), which aims to control expenditure by basic schemes. This target was regularly exceeded until 2009, but the 2004 Health Act and ongoing strengthening of its control and monitoring mechanisms have ensured that it has been respected since 2010.

However, health insurance benefits in France will increase by 4.3% (after a 2.4% increase in 2019) to €228 billion. This increase can be explained by:
1. Increases in the provision of care in the hospital sector and, to a lesser extent, in outpatient care.

These are listed in the French Penal Code and classified into three categories in order of seriousness: contraventions, délits, and crimes.","The offences for which a doctor may be held responsible may also be committed by any citizen. However, doctors are more likely to commit certain offences than others. There are three main types of offences arising from the practice of medical care: those resulting from the breach of a duty of humanity, unintentional injury and manslaughter, and intentional injury and manslaughter.",The violation of a duty of humanism mainly concerns:,"The violation of a duty of humanism mainly concerns:

3. Failure to assist a person in danger (Article 226-3 of the French Penal Code)."
OIC-005-01-A,What is liability? What are its three elements?,"Liability is the responsibility of an individual or institution. It can be sought either to penalize a professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare.",The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance.,"In order to receive compensation for the harmful consequences of a medical act, a user must prove that the act caused the damage, that it gave rise to liability, and that there was a causal link between the act and the damage. In terms of the liability of healthcare professionals and establishments, damage can take several forms. It may be: physical or mental injury, loss of chance of survival or recovery, a loss of opportunity to have escaped a risk that ultimately materialized (in the case of failure to provide information). The damage must be present and certain. It may be future if it is certain (for example, the sterility of a child as a result of faulty irradiation). The causal link between the event giving rise to liability (generally fault) and the damage must be certain. It need not be direct or exclusive.","The courts accept that compensation may be awarded for loss of chance of survival or recovery. In this case, compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability of survival or recovery lost as a result of the fault. The same reasoning applies in the case of a failure to provide information. In this case, the patient has lost a chance to escape the risk that ultimately materialized. In other words, if they had been informed of the risk, they could have chosen to run it or to forego the medical procedure. Compensation is awarded in proportion to the probability that the patient would have had of foregoing the procedure if he had been informed of the risk. As a result, if the procedure was essential, the judge concludes that even if the patient had been informed of the risk, he would not have decided to undergo the procedure. The loss of chance is therefore zero.",">Liability is the responsibility of an individual or institution.

**Title:** Know the Indications and Differential Diagnoses of Spermatic Cord Torsion Imaging 
**Rubric:** Additional Examinations
- If the clinical picture strongly suggests cord torsion, further investigation is not indicated.
- A strong clinical suspicion of spermatic cord torsion may delay emergency surgical management if imaging is pursued.
- Testicular ultrasound with Doppler is crucial in cases of acute bursal disease, especially after 24 hours. The study is compared with the contralateral testicle. Diagnosis of spermatic cord torsion can be challenging. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, particularly with atypical symptoms (fever, inflammatory appearance of the bursa, age > 30 years), a frustrated form, or scrotal pain present for more than 24 hours, scrotal ultrasound can assist in guiding the diagnosis.
- In typical cases of tight spermatic cord torsion, testicular ultrasound with Doppler may show:

- The whirlpool sign in the inguinal region, indicating coiling of the spermatic vessels
- An ascending testicle with heterogeneous echostructure, hypoechoic, and changes in the orientation of its long axis
- Reduced or absent intra-testicular vascularization compared with the contralateral side

- Ultrasound is neither sensitive nor specific for diagnosing cord torsion.
- A normal Doppler examination does not rule out an episode of torsion.
- Testicular Doppler ultrasound can rule out hydatid torsion, necrosis or intratumoral hemorrhage, traumatic rupture of the albuginea, or inguino-scrotal hernia.
- If the diagnosis is suspected, surgical exploration without imaging is recommended initially.
- Orchi-epididymitis may mimic cord torsion on ultrasound.","The whirlpool sign in the inguinal region indicates coiling of the spermatic vessels. The testicle is typically ascending and hypoechoic with a reduced or absent intra-testicular vascularization compared to the contralateral side.

For example, overweight, which in the Renaissance was synonymous with good health, gradually became a major public health problem from the 1960s-1970s onwards.","For sociologists, notably Pierre Bourdieu, the body performs at least three functions: memory, learning class habits, and as a marker of social position. The body bears witness to inequalities between social classes, depending on eating habits or the type of work performed, which do not shape bodies in the same way.","In addition to social differences, there are cultural differences. Voluntary transformations of the body, such as tattoos, piercings, and scarification, have different functions in different eras and societies. There are also differences in the production of bodily norms and rules depending on religion.",option_c

OIC-020-03-A,"The regulation of health research is regulated by legislation, primarily in France by the Public Health Code, which defines the legal framework for clinical research and the obligations of those involved. The Jardé Law (2012, effective 2016) distinguishes three categories of research conducted on human beings to develop biological or medical knowledge: Interventions Research (RIPH category 1): Involves interventions not justified by usual care and not devoid of risk, primarily studies on the efficacy and safety of medicines or medical devices. Minimal Risk and Minimal Burden Interventional Research (category 2 MHIR): Involves adding interventions to standard practice with only minimal risks and burdens, excluding research on medicinal products and medical devices, which fall under category 1. Non-interventional Research (RIPH category 3): Involves procedures and products used in the usual way, without additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment, or monitoring procedures, and without additional risks or constraints. Clarification on Experimental vs. Interventional: All experimental studies are interventional, but not all interventional studies are experimental. An interventional study is defined by the regulatory framework: some observational studies may be interventional if specific data collection methods are used for the study or if the patient's medical monitoring schedule is modified. Roles in Research: Promoter: The individual or entity that initiates, manages, and funds the research, legally responsible for it. All RIPH must have a promoter. Investigator: The individual who directs and supervises the research at a site, following the protocol. Information and Consent: Research participants must be informed before inclusion. Information must be appropriate, complete, fair, and comprehensible. Informed consent is required for category 1 or 2 RIPH, or non-opposition for category 3 RIPH, before inclusion. Role of the Comité de Protection des Personnes (CPP): Composed of health professionals and civil society members, the CPP ensures research complies with legal conditions and provides opinions on the scientific validity and ethical aspects.

Subjects who developed the event of interest during follow-up are included as ""cases,"" and subjects who did not develop the event after an equivalent length of follow-up are included as ""controls."" These cases and controls can be re-contacted to collect data retrospectively on more specific exposures that were not collected prospectively as part of the cohort, without having to re-contact all the subjects in the initial cohort.","A case-cohort study from an existing cohort, a sample called the ""sub-cohort"" is selected at random (i.e., representative of the entire cohort). All the incident 'cases' in the cohort (all the individuals who have experienced the event of interest, whether or not from the sub-cohort) are selected and compared with the 'non-cases' in the sub-cohort only. This scheme is used in particular when the study requires additional data to be collected. In order to avoid collecting data on the entire initial cohort, only cases (from the entire cohort) and ""non-cases"" (from the sub-cohort) are collected. For example, the association between a genetic anomaly and the occurrence of cancer (the genetic anomaly will only be measured in cancer cases and non-cases in the sub-cohort).","A quasi-experimental study aims to evaluate the effect on a judgment criterion of an experimental intervention, conducted on an individual or population scale, i.e., administered to all or some of the subjects in a population as part of a study, outside a randomized trial. In practice: No control group, for example in: A repeated cross-sectional before/after survey design of an intervention conducted on an experimental basis in a population to compare the prevalence of the event of interest between the two periods. The problem is the possible existence of a period effect: we do not know how this prevalence changes over the same period for a population where the intervention was not administered. A cohort design in which all the subjects included receive an experimental intervention on inclusion, or during follow-up, and in which the incidence rate of the event of interest, or its evolution before/after the intervention, is studied in an almost descriptive manner; this incidence rate may be compared with known rates in the source population.","A study on grouped (aggregated) data: We do not know the individual status of the health phenomenon of interest, but we can estimate its frequency at the level of a group of subjects (defined, for example, on a geographical criterion: region, country). This is the case when we have a registration system that lists all the subjects who have developed the event of interest during a given period in a given population (e.g., cancer registry, notifiable diseases). To estimate the frequency of the event of interest in this population, we can use census data, for example, which will give us the total size of the population over the period for the denominator. These frequencies can be compared between several populations or over time. When different recording systems are available to estimate the frequency of the event of interest and that of exposure factors in groups of subjects, it is also possible to compare the joint changes in these frequencies over time or space. Example: estimate changes in the age- and sex-standardized cancer incidence rate in France between 1990 and 2020 using cancer registries, compare these incidence rates between different regions, study the correlation between changes in these incidence rates and changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption over the same period.",option_d

**Rubric:** Definition","The interaction factor must not be confused with a confounding factor: the presence of a confounding factor can produce (or amplify) the association under study even though it does not exist, or mask (or reduce) it when it does exist.

To account for an interaction factor, we can perform:

- A stratified analysis.

- The introduction of an interaction term into a multivariate model.","The interaction test is necessary to determine whether the effect is modified in a statistically significant way, i.e., whether there is a significant difference in the association between the levels of the interaction factor (the null hypothesis is the absence of interaction, the alternative hypothesis is the existence of an interaction).

Example: Study evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer (fictitious figures):

**Confounding Factor:**

- Men: RR = 2.67
- Women: RR = 2.05

Sex is a confounding factor here: when stratified by sex, the association between smoking and lung cancer decreases, but the estimated RR is approximately the same in each stratum.

**Interaction Factor:**

- Inhalation: RR = 2.43
- No Inhalation: RR = 1.20

The fact of inhaling smoke is an interaction factor here: the estimate of the association between smoking and lung cancer is not the same depending on whether or not the smoke is inhaled.","To account for an interaction factor, we can perform:

",Allergic risk: Linked to taking medication; this is an exceptional risk.,"Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: Main risk with variable severity. It is linked to an excessive ovarian response to stimulation, causing pelvic pain and bloating. This can lead to ascites or pleural effusion, with varying degrees of weight gain. Severe forms can be life-threatening, requiring intensive care. The main complication is the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, with phlebitis or pulmonary embolism suspected in the presence of chest pain or dyspnoea following puncture. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) should be instituted in cases of proven ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If pregnancy occurs during oocyte puncture, this thromboprophylaxis is usually maintained during the first trimester.","Adnexal torsion: An exceptional risk linked to increased ovarian volume during stimulation, suspected with sudden, acute, lateral pelvic pain and pelvic defense.

As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones, and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C or used in fertilization for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.",Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured ,"Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF).

This condition is often associated with a high fever (>39°C) and other symptoms such as chills or shaking chills. It may also be accompanied by signs of sepsis, including low blood pressure, rapid pulse, and difficulty breathing. Treatment involves antibiotics to kill the germs causing the pericarditis and drainage of the fluid surrounding the heart."

**Educational Content:**

**Item Parent:** Surveillance of wearers of valvular prostheses 

**Title:** Know how to diagnose the removal of a prosthetic valve, including haemolysis 

**Definitions:""

There are two main causes of prosthesis deinsertion:
- Early onset: Loosening of the suture of the prosthesis or paravalvular leakage due to significant calcification.
- Medium- or long-term onset: Deleterious infective endocarditis, which should be systematically investigated.
The clinical picture varies, depending on the severity of the induced regurgitation and the speed at which it develops. Disinsertion may be completely asymptomatic or may progress to a state of cardiogenic shock.

**Physical Examination:**
- A regurgitant murmur is noted, diastolic at the aortic site for a prosthesis in the aortic position, and systolic at the mitral site for a prosthesis in the mitral position.

**Key Examinations:**
- The primary examination is Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), generally supplemented by Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).
- Colour Doppler can identify a paraprosthetic leak, i.e., a leak between the prosthesis and the native valve annulus.
- Ultrasound is used to quantify the leak and assess its impact, particularly on the left ventricle.

**Laboratory Tests:**
- Blood cultures should be taken systematically to avoid missing infective endocarditis.
- Biologically, there is generally a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome and sometimes haemolysis. In haemolysis, LDH is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. The presence of schizocytes indicates the mechanical origin of the anaemia.

**Management:**
- If the deinsertion is moderate, stable, asymptomatic, and has no impact on the TTE, simple monitoring may suffice.
- In the event of complications, interventional or surgical management may be required.","The clinical picture varies, depending on the severity of the induced regurgitation and the speed at which it develops.

Patients with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection, with the incidence of prosthesis-related IE estimated at around 5% at 5 years. Early adverse events (AEs) occurring less than one year after implantation result from peri-operative contamination (e.g., catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).

Clinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. Additionally, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.
The diagnostic strategy for adverse reactions (ARs) on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves.

Antibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.
The indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following conditions being particularly favorable: clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by Staphylococcus Aureus.

Prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends primarily on clear information being provided to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.

**Educational Content**

**Item Parent:** Specificities of genetic diseases (see item 9)

**Title:** Karyotype Prescription Procedures

**Description:** Prescription methods and the principle of carrying out a karyotype. Knowledge of the different karyotypic anomalies in trisomy 21.

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Trisomy 21, or Down's syndrome, is suspected clinically and confirmed chromosomally.
The test to be prescribed is a constitutional karyotype on lymphocytes: a 2 ml peripheral venous blood sample in a heparinised tube.
Parents/patients need to be informed and asked to sign a consent form with a certificate of genetic counselling.
Information must be provided on:

- The objective (purpose) of the test: diagnosis of trisomy 21.
- The nature of the test: karyotype.
- The limitations of the test: no detection of abnormalities of less than 5 megabases (Mb), weak mosaics, nucleotide variants, risk of culture failure, etc.
- The delivery time: 4-5 days in the case of trisomy 21.
- The need to inform relatives if a serious condition justifying preventive measures, including genetic counselling or care, is identified.

A Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) study can be requested for a preliminary result within 24-48 hours.
To carry out genetic counselling, it is necessary to have the results of the karyotype to understand the mechanism causing trisomy 21.
Karyotyping can identify three types of results:

- Complete and homogeneous free trisomy 21: 95% of cases
  - Free: 3 separate 21 chromosomes
  - Complete: the whole of chromosome 21
  - Homogenous: in all cells

- Complete mosaic free trisomy 21: 2-3% of cases
  - Mosaic: two cell populations, cells with three 21 chromosomes and cells with two 21 chromosomes

- Complete trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation: 2-3% of cases
  - Robertsonian translocation: fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common example is a fusion between chromosome 14 and 21.
Note: Partial trisomy 21 can be identified by an unbalanced translocation involving part of chromosome 21 and part of another chromosome.

**Title:** Know how antenatal screening for trisomy 21 is carried out

**Description:** Know the procedures for antenatal screening for trisomy 21","The course of action varies according to the result of the combined test:
- If the risk is less than 1/1000, simple pregnancy monitoring is recommended.
- If the risk is between 1/51 and 1/1000, non-invasive prenatal screening is proposed (test on free foetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, DPNI):
  - If the DPNI is negative: continuation of the usual ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy.
  - If the DPNI is positive: proposal of a foetal karyotype. The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.
- If the risk is greater than or equal to 1/50, a foetal karyotype is proposed straight away.

As a result, iron is deposited in various organs such as the liver, pancreas, and heart. Haemochromatosis can lead to chronic fatigue ('Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-112)'), melanoderma, and liver damage ('Hepatomegaly (SD-006)') (cirrhosis with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma), diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, ('Joint pain (SD-067)'), osteoporosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or heart failure. Biochemical abnormalities include elevated transferrin saturation coefficient (reflecting hyperabsorption of iron, and therefore very early onset) and elevated serum ferritin (reflecting visceral iron overload, and therefore secondary onset) ('Ferritin: decrease or increase (SD-207)'). Haemochromatosis linked to the 'HFE' gene, by far the most common form, is a frequent disease, with around 1 in 200 Caucasians carrying the genetic predisposition (homozygous ","Haemophilia: X-linked genetic disease characterised by spontaneous or prolonged haemorrhage due to a deficiency in factor VIII ('haemophilia A', gene 'F8') or IX ('haemophilia B', gene 'F9'). The annual incidence is 1 in 5000 male births and the prevalence in the population is estimated at 1/12,000. Haemorrhage usually starts when the child learns to walk. The severity of clinical manifestations depends on the severity of the coagulation factor deficiency: if the biological activity of the coagulation factor is less than 1%, haemophilia is severe. If it is between 1 and 5%, haemophilia is moderate. If it is between 5 and 40%, the haemophilia is minor. Bleeding can occur at any site following trauma, most often in the joints ('Joint pain (SD-067)') and muscles ('Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma (SD-089)'). To compensate for factor VIII or IX deficiency, a replacement therapy is used, the aim of which is to supply the missing factor to the body: recombinant antihaemophilic factor. It can be administered following a haemorrhage ('Treatment on demand') or to prevent bleeding ('Prophylactic treatment'). Haemophilia A and B are haemorrhagic diseases, the management of which is the responsibility of the patient's therapeutic education. The most frequent complication is the appearance of antibodies directed against the infused coagulation factor, inhibiting its action (known as inhibitory antibodies). Surgical corrections, particularly orthopaedic, are possible in specialised centres.","Sickle Cell Anaemia: A frequent autosomal recessive genetic disease ('sickle cell disease') which is serious and mainly affects people of sub-Saharan African and West Indian origin. The prevalence of heterozygotes in Europe is estimated at around 1/150: in Central and West Africa (15-25%), in the American overseas departments (10-12%) and in the Mediterranean regions (1-15%), a high prevalence is observed in areas that are or have been affected by malaria, as this anomaly offers protection against neuromalaria. Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormality in the haemoglobin ('HBB' gene) which results in the deformation of red blood cells, causing them to lose their rounded shape (false shape). Sickle cell anaemia is a chronic haemolytic disease predisposing to 3 types of acute complications: severe anaemia ('Childhood pallor (SD-055)', 'Decreased haemoglobin (SD-217)'), severe bacterial infections, and ischaemic vaso-occlusive accidents ('AVO' secondary to conflicts between the small vessels and the red blood cells which are not sufficiently deformable). Various organic complications may also arise. Management must include the prevention of infections, pain ('Assessment and management of acute pain (SD-259)', 'Assessment and management of chronic pain (SDD-260)', 'Assessment and management of pain in children and infants (SD-261)') and any complications, as well as the social and psycho-educational dimension, within multidisciplinary centres equipped with intensive care ('Immediate access to blood transfusion'). Occasional or scheduled transfusion remains an essential therapeutic modality ('Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion (SD-272)'). The main indication for bone marrow transplantation is the presence of cerebral vasculopathy. Some children with severe sickle cell disease may require intensified treatment: hydroxycarbamide, transfusion programme, haematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene therapy. Systematic neonatal screening is offered to at-risk populations.","Thalassaemias: Genetic disorders, most often autosomal recessive, which result in a reduction in the synthesis of globin chains, either alpha ('alpha-thalassaemias', 'HBA1' and 'HBA2' genes) or beta ('beta-thalassaemias', 'HBB' gene). The imbalance in synthesis between alpha and non-alpha chains causes precipitation of unpaired chains, inefficient erythropoiesis, and anaemia ('Child pallor (SD-055)', 'Haemoglobin decrease (SD-217)'). Depending on the degree of anaemia and transfusion requirements, a distinction is made between intermediate thalassaemias with moderate transfusion requirements and major thalassaemias for which regular transfusions are vital ('Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion (SD-272)'). The prognosis for these forms has been improved by transfusion programmes and iron chelation; given the complexity of the treatment, children are offered a bone marrow transplant with an HLA-compatible related donor.","Haemochromatosis: A genetic disease caused by excessive intestinal absorption of iron, most often linked to a deficiency in the production of hepcidin, the systemic iron-regulating hormone, and more rarely to hepcidino-resistance.

Failure to resume micturition after removal or clamping of the catheter warrants surgical management.","Acute Urinary Retention may complicate BPH, presenting as acute prostatitis or orchi-epididymitis. It should be suspected with an exacerbation of SBAU, urinary burning, and fever. On examination, acute prostatitis presents with a painful rectum, while orchi-epididymitis shows as an inflamed and swollen area on examination of the external genitalia. Urinary infection is confirmed by ECBU and requires hospitalisation if poorly tolerated. Initial treatment involves a probabilistic antibiotic (quinolone), later adapted according to the antibiogram.","Macroscopic Haematuria may complicate BPH. BPH can only be considered as a cause once other causes, such as urothelial carcinoma or kidney tumours, are ruled out. These should be investigated by uro CT scan and bladder fibroscopy. The presence of clots with urinary retention requires the insertion of a large-calibre dual-current bladder catheter for decalcification with lavage.","Acute Renal Failure linked to the subvesical obstruction of BPH should be suspected with back pain, oedema, nausea, reduced diuresis, or anuria. Renal failure is confirmed by measuring creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate, and the cause is identified by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound.

**Description:** Genetic predispositions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer: BRCA1/2 mutations, breast-ovarian syndrome, role of BRCA1/2 in oncogenesis
**Rubric:** Physiopathology 

**Definitions**
- Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two main causes of familial breast and ovarian cancer, classically known as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.
- HBOC accounts for around 20% of familial breast cancers, but less than 5% of all breast cancers. It is important to look for a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and, if necessary, to draw up a family tree.
- The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for proteins that play major roles in DNA repair and act as tumor suppressors. If these proteins are defective, DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired and contribute to carcinogenesis.
- A patient with a BRCA1/2 mutation should undergo either specific annual surveillance, including breast MRI, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Prophylactic bilateral adnexectomy is systematically recommended (between the ages of 40 and 45).

**Additional Genetic Predispositions**
- Several cases of cancer in the same person or in the family may point to another genetic predisposition syndrome: PALB2 mutation, Li Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene coding for the p53 protein).","Based on the following educational content, generate a multiple-choice question with four answer options where only one is correct.

**Item Parent:** Neurophysiological bases, physiopathological mechanisms of acute and chronic pain 

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose Cancer Pain 

**Description:** Understanding the different types of cancer pain and their management 

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

- According to an Inca survey conducted for the second cancer plan in 2010, 53% of patients with all types and stages of cancer report experiencing pain, with 28% considering their pain severe.
- Among those with advanced cancer, 62% appear to be under-treated. Pain persists in 14% of patients in remission.

**Mechanisms of Pain in Cancer Patients 

Cancer pain is caused by several mechanisms: nociceptive, neuropathic, mixed (neuropathic and nociceptive), and nociplastic.

**Classification of Cancer Pain 

Cancer-related pain can be acute or chronic:
- Related to the tumor: Pain can be nociceptive or neuropathic (due to radicular compression, epiduritis, plexus invasion).
- Related to cancer treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy): This is often neuropathic pain.

**Types of Pain According to Duration and Evolution 

- Often continuous background pain
- Paroxysmal pain such as throbbing, stabbing, or electric shocks, or an increase in continuous pain.
- Paroxysmal pain attacks (PPA) or ",breakthrough pain,pain attacks occurring at the end of a morphine dose.,"paroxysm is reached in less than 3 minutes.

Diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis, specifies the location of the EP, and may identify risk factors (adhesions, sequelae of HGI). Conservative treatment options include salpingotomy or removal of the tube (salpingectomy). Pauci or Asymptomatic Ectopic Pregnancy (EP) In this case, treatment with methotrexate can be discussed with the patient: an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/m² in the absence of contraindications on the biological work-up (CBC, PT/ACT, renal and hepatic work-up). Monitoring includes questioning about clinical symptoms and weekly monitoring of plasma β-hCG levels. A clinical examination and ultrasound scan may be carried out at any time in the event of functional signs suggesting a haemorrhagic complication of the EP. A second injection of methotrexate should be considered if the decrease in the plasma β-hCG level at day 7 is not satisfactory compared with the initial level (in practice, the β-hCG level at day 7 should be strictly lower than the level at day 0 or strictly lower than 85% of the β-hCG level at day 4 if this is available). Cure corresponds to an undetectable plasma β-hCG level, generally achieved after one month. Special Cases: In certain exceptional cases, if the patient is asymptomatic, if the initial β-hCG level is less than 1,000 IU/L, and if the kinetics of β-hCG show a progressive and constant decrease, it may be possible to discuss abstention from treatment subject to good compliance by the patient (β-hCG measurement every 48 hours and clinical and ultrasound monitoring once a week).

These therapeutic methods are carried out on an outpatient basis, through an anoscopy, and most often during a specialised gastroenterology consultation. These strategies constitute the basic treatment for chronic haemorrhoidal disease.","The term ""surgical haemorrhoid treatment"" describes all procedures designed to treat haemorrhoidal tissue under general, peridural, or locoregional anaesthetic. There are two types of haemorrhoidal surgery: those which remove the haemorrhoidal tissue (known as haemorrhoidectomy) and those which fix or tighten the haemorrhoidal tissue using a mechanical process (pexy with wire or mechanical forceps) or heat (radiofrequency, laser). The first type is the benchmark in terms of effectiveness and is often the only procedure possible in cases of anatomically advanced haemorrhoidal disease or recurrent external thrombosis. The second type is more similar to the instrumental treatments mentioned above: it is simpler, often quicker, and less painful. Patients are often immobilised for a shorter period after the procedure. There is a greater risk of recurrence. Complications are inherent in any type of surgery, but rare functional sequelae such as incontinence must be prevented and assessed before the procedure.","The treatment of external haemorrhoidal thrombosis is not, strictly speaking, a surgical procedure. However, an incision or excision can easily be performed in consultation. With a few precautions and a little patience, this strategy is effective in relieving pain and shortening its course.

**Item Parent:** Microcrystalline Arthropathies 

**Title:** Acknowledging Severe Forms of Gout 

**Description:** Frequency of Attacks, Tophus, Chronic Arthropathies, Comorbidities Without hypouricemic treatment, attacks will recur with increasing frequency. After several years, gout can affect the upper limbs and even the spine, hip, and shoulder.

**Treatment of Hyponatremia:""
- Includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
- The amount of excess water is estimated using the formula: Excess Water = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).

**In Chronic Hyponatremia, Priority Should Be Given to:
- Etiological treatment (e.g., discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH).
- Fluid restriction (500 mL/day) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
- Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector:
  - In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
  - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
    - Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
    - If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/day orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.

**Title:** Understanding the Mechanisms of Hyponatremia 
**Description:** Notion of Hypoosmolality and Cellular Hyperhydration 
**Rubric:** Physiopathology

Water accounts for 60% of body weight: 
- 40% in the intracellular sector 
- 20% in the extracellular sector, divided into the interstitial sector (15%) and vascular sector (plasma water 5%) 
Osmolarity is expressed in mOsm/L of plasma. 
Osmolality is expressed in mOsm/kg of water.

**Estimation of Plasma Osmolality:** 
Posm = [Na+ × 2] + Blood glucose (mmol/L) = 285 mOsm/kg of water. In this formula, which estimates effective osmolality (tonicity), urea is not taken into account. Because it passes freely through cell membranes, it increases osmolality without causing water movement.

At steady state, osmolality is identical between the extracellular and intracellular compartments and is approximately 285 mOsm/kg H2O.

**Estimation of Urinary Osmolality:** 
Uosm = [Na+ + K+] x 2 + urea (mmol/L)
A disorder of intracellular hydration is the consequence of a non-zero water balance (positive in intracellular hyperhydration [ICH] and negative in intracellular dehydration [IDH]), and is necessarily accompanied by a change in osmolality (hypoosmolality in ICH and hyperosmolality in ICD) and therefore in natraemia, which is the main determinant of osmolality (hyponatremia in ICH and hypernatremia in ICD). It may be isolated or accompanied by a disorder of extracellular hydration.

The kidney's capacity to excrete free water is important. It depends on the capacity to suppress hypothalamic-pituitary secretion of ADH and the maximum dilution capacity of the kidney. Under normal conditions, the kidney can lower urinary osmolality to a minimum of 60 mOsm/kg of H2O. Pure water cannot be eliminated on its own, so a minimum supply of osmoles in the urine is required (in practice 60 mOsm/kg). This can lead to a positive water balance and hypo-osmolality (and therefore hyponatremia): 
- When the maximum physiological water excretion capacity is exceeded, for example, in the case of potomania: 
  - For a standard osmolar intake of 600 mOsm/day, a positive water balance (dilution hyponatremia due to the inability to eliminate all the water drunk) occurs for a water intake of more than 10 liters (potomania). To eliminate 1 liter of water with a urinary osmolality of 60 mOsm/kg, 60 mOsm are required. To eliminate 10 liters, 600 mOsm are required.
  - For an osmolar intake of 120 mOsm/day (low intake, situation observed in the case of diets low in animal proteins and salt, anorexia nervosa), a positive water balance appears for a water intake of more than 2 liters (tea and toast syndrome).

- When water excretion is reduced by altering the maximum diluting power of urine. There are two main situations: 
  - Low ADH associated with a primary renal defect in water excretion as in advanced chronic renal failure (GFR ≤ 20 mL/min) 
  - High ADH: 
    - Appropriate secretion of ADH in hypovolemic situations: 
      - True hypovolemia (all causes of extracellular dehydration) 
      - ",Effective,"Congestive heart failure
      - Cirrhosis 
      - Nephrotic syndrome 
    - Inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH): inappropriate because the blood volume is normal and there is no braking associated with the drop in osmolality.

**Educational Content:**

**Item Parent:** Disorders of acid-base equilibrium and hydro-electrolytic disorders

**Title:** Know how to diagnose metabolic acidosis associated with renal failure, diarrhea, lactic acidosis, and ketoacidosis.

**Description:** Understand the clinical context and the diagnostic value of the plasma anion gap.

**Rubric:** Diagnostic Approach

**1. First Step: Confirm Metabolic Acidosis""
- Acidosis: arterial blood pH < 7.38 (or venous pH < 7.32)
- Metabolic: HCO3 < 22 mmol/L (with secondary fall in PCO2 by ventilatory compensation)

**2. Second Step: Characterize Whether the Metabolic Acidosis is Simple, Mixed, or Complex""
- Simple: PaCO2 = expected PaCO2
- Mixed: PaCO2 > expected PaCO2
- Complex: PaCO2 < expected PaCO2

**3. Third Step: Determine the Plasma Anion Gap""
BP = [Na⁺] + [K⁺] - [Cl⁻ + HCO3⁻] = 16 ± 4 mmol/L
Variations in BP help assess whether the anion accompanying the excess H⁺ (and therefore the loss of HCO3⁻) is chlorine (the anion measured) or unmeasured anions.
- Acidosis with normal anion gap (HCl gain): renal or digestive loss of HCO3⁻ leads to a decrease in HCO3⁻ compensated by a proportional increase in Cl⁻ (HCl gain), resulting in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
- Acidosis with high anion gap (BP > 20 mmol/L): addition of H⁺ associated with an unmeasured anion (AH gain) leads to a drop in [HCO3⁻] replaced by an unmeasured anion (e.g., lactate).

**4. Diagnose Metabolic Acidosis with Increased Plasma Anion Gap""
- Lactic Acidosis (lactate assay): acidosis and BP secondary to lactic acid accumulation:
  - Shock with tissue hypoxia
  - Biguanide toxicity (in the event of overdose in renal failure)
- Ketoacidosis (determination of ketonemia; ketonuria by urine dipstick):
  - Diabetic ketoacidosis

- In symptomatic patients, an antiplaquettaire, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia, and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension are instituted.

- In asymptomatic patients, a statin even in the absence of dyslipidaemia and an IEC even in the absence of hypertension. Antiplaquettaire treatment is discussed according to the patient's overall cardiovascular risk.","In Case of Claudication:

- Walking training should be introduced after assessment of coronary exercise tolerance, based on a personalised programme including regular assessment. It can be practised by self-training at home or optimised by treatment in a specialised centre with supervised rehabilitation and a structured therapeutic education programme. It allows collaterals to be developed and walking distance to be increased.

- Surgical revascularisation improves perfusion in the affected area. Sometimes, without aiming for complete revascularisation, it aims to treat the most significant lesion. It may be performed using endoluminal techniques (angioplasty with or without a stent) or open surgery (endarterectomy or bypass for proximal lesions).

- In the event of persistent disabling claudication despite optimal medical management for 6 months and control of atheromatous risk factors.

- It may be discussed from the outset or at an earlier stage in the case of lesions that pose a threat due to their location or haemodynamic impact.","Regular monitoring ensures:

- Adherence to proposed therapeutic lifestyle modifications, walking rehabilitation, and drug prescriptions.

- Achievement of therapeutic targets:

- LDL cholesterol below 1.4 mmol/L (0.55 g/L) and 50% reduction from baseline.

- Blood pressure below 120/70 mmHg if well tolerated. In elderly or frail patients, higher blood pressure levels may be tolerated.

- Glycaemic control

- Smoking cessation","In Case of Symptoms at Rest:

Sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors should be investigated for OSA.","A clinical and haemodynamic classification is used. It is based on the search for symptoms and the measurement of perfusion pressures: systolic ankle pressure index (SAPI = ratio of ankle pressure to brachial pressure), ankle pressure, and big toe pressure.

A distinction is made between:

- Claudication: exertional ischaemia stage (SPI ≤ 0.90)
- Symptoms at rest: permanent ischaemia stage (ankle pressure < 50 mmHg or big toe pressure < 30 mmHg)","In the case of diabetes or chronic renal failure, the GPI and ankle pressure are often inaccurate due to arterial stiffness (calcification of the arterial wall). Diagnosis is then based on the measurement of pressure at the big toe (digital pressure). Any finding of an SPI >1.4 should systematically lead to a measurement of toe pressure. The diagnosis of AOMI is accepted in the event of toe pressure < 0.7.

- **Origin**: 
  - Arterial: Always the same distance of onset, cramp-like pain requiring rapid cessation of exercise, fast recovery, atheromatous context.
  - Venous: Variable distance of onset, progressive sensation of painful swelling that does not force cessation of exercise, slow recovery, deep venous thrombosis of a collecting trunk.
  - Articular: Pain from the first steps, maximum joint topography from the outset, slow recovery, arthrosis, trauma sequelae, inflammatory rheumatism.

**Description:** Collection of fresh stools on three occasions a few days apart to increase sensitivity. A negative result does not rule out the diagnosis. Know how to prescribe specific tests for conditions such as anguillulosis and cryptosporidiosis.

**Rubric:** Additional Tests

In cases of diarrhoea following a trip to a tropical zone, in cases of immunodepression, and chronic diarrhoea:
- Testing for giardiasis may be requested in the event of persistent digestive problems (pain, bloating, frothy stools) in children or adults.
- Testing for intestinal amoebiasis is indicated in cases of bloody stools after a trip to an endemic area.
- Cryptosporidiosis testing must be specified for immunocompromised patients or children.
- Testing for anguillulosis is indicated in the event of a prolonged stay in an endemic area (migration), in the case of hypereosinophilia, or in anticipation of immunosuppressive treatment.","The most common cause of diarrhoea in adults and children is viral gastroenteritis. The diagnosis should be made on clinical grounds.

  - Cervical adenopathies > 1.5 cm, bilateral but possibly unilateral (or asymmetric), which can sometimes lead to the diagnosis of a phlegmon.","There are incomplete forms (fewer than 4 major criteria), which can lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in younger children, exposing them to a greater risk of cardiac complications. In the presence of unexplained fever lasting more than 5 days, with a patient in poor general condition, it is important to investigate this diagnosis (in addition to the infectious work-up) by means of a biological work-up and cardiac ultrasound. A normal cardiac ultrasound does not rule out the diagnosis, but in the case of coronary dilatation, the diagnosis may be accepted even if there are fewer than 4 other major criteria other than fever.","The following anomalies are often observed:

- Inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and SV, hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis (appearing later, around day 10), hypoalbuminemia.

Liver abnormality: moderate cytolysis (frequent), more rarely elevated bilirubin.

Very frequent aseptic leucocyturia.

Aseptic meningitis (when lumbar puncture is performed).","Complications:

- Acute: Multisystemic form ""Kawasaki shock"" with myocarditis, multivisceral damage, macrophagic activation syndrome.

Sub-acute: Dilatation of the coronary arteries, which may lead to aneurysm. The risk of dilatation is increased after 10 days without treatment, so the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is urgent. Diagnosis is made using a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound by a cardiologist experienced with this disease.","The diagnosis is based on several factors.

Complete Classical Form:

- Combines a fever lasting 5 days or more and 4 of the following major criteria: 
  - Maculopapular exanthema or diffuse erythema of the trunk and limbs with early fine desquamation at day 5. 
  - Involvement of the extremities with erythema of the palms and soles and/or edema of the hands and feet and/or subacute fine desquamation (later, around day 10). 
  - Bilateral non-suppurative bulbar conjunctivitis.
  - Oropharyngeal involvement: glossitis and/or cheilitis and/or pharyngitis.

**Educational Content**
**Item Parent:** Hematuria 
**Title:** Knowing the Main Additional Tests to be Prescribed for Hematuria 
**Description:** None 
**Rubric:** Complementary Examinations 

**Definitions**
Hematuria, whether microscopic or macroscopic, always requires a clinical, biological, and radiological etiological investigation. Isolated macroscopic hematuria should always rule out a urological cause before considering a nephrological cause.

**Confirmatory Tests**
The urine culture (ECBU) can be used to confirm hematuria (presence of red blood cells in the urine), quantify it, and rule out a urinary tract infection.

**Minimal Work-Up and Assessment**
- Blood count (CBC)
- Hemostasis work-up (TP/TCA +/- INR)
- Assessment of renal function (creatinine level and GFR estimate)
- Proteinuria detection by dipstick and quantification if positive 

**Minimal Etiological Work-Up**
- **First Intention Urinary Tract Imaging and Urinary Cytology:** Most often involves urethrovesical fibroscopy (second intention). This work-up must be carried out early.
  - **Urinary Cytology:** Conducted on morning urine outside the hematuric episode. The pathologist looks for high-grade tumor cells, indicating a potential bladder urothelial carcinoma or upper excretory tract issue.
  - **First Line Imaging:** Renal-vesical ultrasound
  - **Uro-Scanner:** Systematic reference examination. It includes an injection-free phase to look for calculi in the urinary tree and assess spontaneous densities, an arterial phase for contrast from renal, bladder, or upper excretory tract tumors, or vascular anomalies, and a late excretory phase which may be combined with a nephrographic phase, often sensitized by the injection of a diuretic. The late excretory time is used to visualize gaps in the urinary tree. Uro-MRI is used when iodine is contraindicated.
  - **Traumatic Hematuria:** May require, after CT scan, diagnostic and/or therapeutic arteriography in case of active bleeding (arterioembolization).
  - **Urethrovesical Fibroscopy (or Flexible Urethrocystoscopy):** Performed by a urologist under local anesthetic. Indications include imaging with no obvious etiology, positive urine cytology (CIS = carcinoma in situ), or risk factors for urothelial tumors (age, smoking, or occupational exposure). Inspection of the ureteral meatus can sometimes reveal bloody urine ejaculate and lateralize hematuria from the upper excretory tract. When the etiological diagnosis is obvious (e.g., large bladder tumor), urethrovesical fibroscopy is not necessary.
  - **Rigid or Flexible Ureteroscopy:** Explores the ureter and renal cavities under general anesthetic in the operating theatre. Indicated if a tumor of the upper urinary excretory tract is suspected.

**Nephrological Referral**
In the event of nephrological referral (suggestive personal or family history, edema of the lower limbs, arterial hypertension, renal insufficiency, presence of blood vessels, etc.):
- Search for proteinuria (24-hour proteinuria or urine protein/creatinine ratio on sample), ideally outside a hematuric episode.
- A 24-hour proteinuria >2g or a urine protein/creatinine ratio >2g/g (especially if >70% albumin) is suggestive of glomerular hematuria.
- Indication for renal biopsy under ultrasound, discussed if microscopic hematuria is associated with glomerular proteinuria or in cases of recurrent macroscopic hematuria without urological etiology (e.g., IgA nephropathy).

**Follow-Up**
If no etiology is found in this work-up (< 10% of clinical situations, mostly microscopic hematuria), the work-up should be repeated if the hematuria persists or recurs, especially in patients who smoke or are > 40 years old.

It can be caused by many factors including stress, illness, and certain medications. Severe hypoglycemia requires immediate medical attention as it can lead to coma or death. Hyperosmolar coma is a life-threatening emergency that occurs when the body's ability to regulate fluid balance is impaired due to dehydration. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2 in children and adults. It is characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and low blood pH.
