This option directly addresses the main idea of the question. Option C is incorrect as it refers to the pupil's dilator muscle, which is not the primary target of parasympathetic fibers in relation to pupillary constriction. The correct answer requires an understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the autonomic nervous system.  === Correct option: option_a === }  === Incorrect options: option_b, option_c, option_d === Option d would be incorrect as it refers to a muscle not directly innervated by parasympathetic fibers for pupillary constriction. The correct answer is among the three pre-ganglionic parasympathetic fibres which reach their targets via post-ganglionic neurons, while the pupil's dilator muscle remains unresponsive due to its unique anatomy and physiology.  === Incorrect options: option_b, option_c, option_d === }  === Correct options: option_a, option_e  === Incorrect options: option_b, option_c, option_d  === Answer Options should be as short as possible while following the rules of multiple-choice questions, in this case, only one correct answer is to be selected.
