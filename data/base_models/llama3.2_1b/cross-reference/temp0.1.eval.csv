Hyperthyroidism refers to the excess production of thyroid hormones linked to the hyperfunction of the thyroid gland.

Thyrotoxicosis describes the consequences of excess thyroid hormones in target tissues, regardless of the cause:

- Release of thyroid hormones, as seen in De Quervain's sub-acute thyroiditis.
- Hyperproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland, as in Graves' disease.
- Exogenous supply of thyroid hormones, known as factitious thyrotoxicosis.",1.0,14.111428571428572,False,True,0.8195104598999023,0.0,a,False,5,3

1. **The Different Functions of the Facial Nerve:**

   - **Motor (Main Function):** Innervation of all the skin muscles of the face and neck, as well as the stapedial muscle of the middle ear.
   - **Vegetative:** Secretion from the lacrimal and salivary glands.
   - **Sensory:** Innervation of the skin of the concha of the ear (Ramsay-Hunt zone).
   - **Sensory:** Gustation for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

2. **The Search for an Anomaly Consists of:**

   - Look for a muscular deficit in one hemiface (""Muscular weakness (SDD-074)"", ""Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit (SDD-121)"", ""Facial paralysis (SDD-127)"") at rest, with spontaneous mimicry, and during movements on command:
     - **Upper Face:** Raise and frown the eyebrows (forehead crease), close the eyes against resistance (""Palpebral anomalies (SD-139)"").
     - **Lower Face:** Uncover teeth, puff out cheeks.

   An asymmetry can be confirmed by comparison with a previous photograph. Facial muscles innervated by cranial nerves other than the facial nerve are examined normally: masticatory muscles (trigeminal nerve), muscles of the pharynx and soft palate (glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves), muscles of the tongue (greater hypoglossus nerve).

The newborn is infected in utero following bacteremia of the mother with Listeria monocytogenes. The first stage of infection is colonization of the placenta. This infection is rapidly associated with an intra-uterine infection (chorioamnionitis).

It is estimated that this pathogen is responsible for around 1% of bacterial meningitis in newborns and less than 0.15% of perinatal mortality. After E. coli K1 and SGB, L. monocytogenes remains the third most common cause of neonatal meningitis. The seriousness of listeriosis is therefore due to the bacterium's tropism for the placenta and the central nervous system.

The infection manifests itself from birth with cyanosis, apnea, respiratory distress, and consciousness disorders. In these severe forms, which progress over several days, the mortality rate is high (50-75%). In almost 95% of cases, the disease is purulent meningitis with acute fever in children and adults, insomnia, irritability, and disturbed consciousness.",0.25,15.45,False,True,0.8530949354171753,0.0,b,False,5,1

**Various forms of pollution affect water resources:**

- **Thermal Pollution:** Linked to various human activities, it poses a health risk through the microbiological proliferation it causes, such as free amoebae, legionella, and algae.

- **Radioactive Pollution:** Generally low, except in cases of exceptional accidents.

- **Chemical Pollution:** Probably the most common form:
  - Sodium from mining waste or seawater infiltration.
  - Nitrates from agricultural activities, which are toxic if reduced to nitrites that bind to haemoglobin. They are precursors of nitrosamines and can be carcinogenic.
  - Phosphates from agricultural activities and urban waste contribute to the eutrophication process, leading to the development of algae that produce toxins.
  - Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium) are deposited in river and coastal sediments. They can concentrate in aquatic flora and fauna, posing a poisoning risk to humans.
  - Dangers associated with mineral salt imbalances due to natural contamination or disruption caused by man-made additions.
  - Organic pollution linked to human activities, including detergents, solvents, hydrocarbons, and medicines.

- **Microbial and Parasitic Pollution:**
  - Originates from fecal, human, and animal sources linked to inadequate treatment of drinking water. The most well-known and frequent are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders.
  - **Bacteria:** Salmonella, Shigella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae.
  - **Viruses:** Enterovirus, Coxsackie, Echovirus, Hepatitis A and E, Coronavirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, etc., causing gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and neuromeningeal disorders.

Worldwide, 50 to 75% of adults have had at least one headache (SD-118) in the previous twelve months. Most of these are tension headaches or migraines.

**Tension Headache**

- Episodic (<15 days per month) affects 50-70% of the population, depending on the country.
- Chronic (≥15 days per month) affects 1-2% of adults.
- Often begins in adolescence and affects 3 women for every 2 men.
- Less disabling than migraine.

**Migraine**

- Episodic (<15 days/month) affects 12% of adults, with a peak between the ages of 35 and 39, with 30% of women and 15% of men affected in this age group.
- Affects 7% of pre-pubescent children, with no difference between the sexes.
- Chronic (≥15 days/month) affects 1.7% of adults in France.
- Often begins at puberty, affecting 2 women for every 1 man.
- Often runs in families and is responsible for considerable disability.

**Algie Vasculaire de la Face (AVF)**

- Affects 1 in 1000 people.
- Starts in young adults (around 30) and affects 4-5 men for every 1 woman.
- Includes an episodic form and a chronic form.
- Leads to major disability.

**Drug-Induced Headache (Chronic Daily Headache)**

- Affects 1 to 5% of adults, depending on the country, as a complication of migraine or tension headache.

**Individual and Societal Impact of Primary Headaches**

Primary headaches have a significant individual and societal impact, not only because of the pain but also due to the disability they cause, the reduction in quality of life, and the direct costs (linked to care) or indirect costs (linked to absenteeism).

- According to the WHO, primary headache disorders are underestimated, poorly recognized, and inadequately treated worldwide.

== Treatment of Hypercholesterolaemia ==

- Decision on treatment based on LDL-cholesterol levels in relation to the patient's cardiovascular risk profile.
- Statin treatment as first-line treatment.
- If target not achieved on statin, combine with ezetimibe or even cholestyramine.
- In severe forms, PCSK9 inhibitors may be used.

=== In Patients Aged ≥ 40 Years Without Diabetes, Familial Hypercholesterolaemia, Renal Insufficiency, or Known Cardiovascular Disease ===

- In cases of very high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L (i.e., 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).
- In cases of high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L (i.e., 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).
- In cases of moderate or low cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L (i.e., 1.00 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337). In cases of low cardiovascular risk, the recommendations of the NSFA-SFD-SFE 2014 set a value < 4.9 mmol/L (i.e., 1.90 g/L).

=== In People with Diabetes ===

- In cases of very high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L (i.e., 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).
- In cases of high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L (i.e., 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).

=== In Patients with Renal Failure ===

- In cases of very high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L (i.e., 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).
- In cases of high cardiovascular risk, an LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L (i.e., 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337).

=== In Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolaemia ===

- LDL-cholesterol target < 3.5 mmol/L (i.e., 1.35 g/L) in children (often 4 mmol/L (i.e., 1.6 g/L) until puberty).
- LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L (i.e., 1.00 g/L) in adults treated early without additional cardiovascular risk factors (some practitioners target 3.3 mmol/L (i.e., 1.3 g/L), the median concentration for the French population).
- LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L (i.e., 0.70 g/L) for adults treated late with additional cardiovascular risk factors.
- LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L (i.e., 0.55 g/L) in secondary prevention (limited level of evidence in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).

== Treatment of Hypertriglyceridemia ==

- Initially, dietary measures should be preferred.
- If triglycerides > 5.6 mmol/L (i.e., 5 g/L): treatment with fibrates or fibrates + omega 3, if necessary.

== Treatment of Mixed Hyperlipidaemia ==

- Priority objective: normalization of LDL-cholesterol (according to the rules above).
- Once the LDL-cholesterol target has been reached, it may be suggested that fibrate treatment (preferably fenofibrate; never gemfibrozil) be added in high-risk cardiovascular patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 5.2 mmol/L (i.e., 2.0 g/L) and low HDL-cholesterol.

== Surveillance ==

=== Effectiveness of Treatment ===

- Lipid profile 2 to 3 months after initiation of treatment to check that lipid targets are being met, then annually.

=== Clinical Tolerance ===

- Search for myalgias.

=== Biological Tolerance ===

- Measurement of transaminases, before and within 3 months of starting treatment.
- CPK measurement only if myalgia.",0.6,18.736363636363638,False,True,0.7921500205993652,0.0,d,False,2,3

== Characteristic Depressive Episode ==  
Diagnostic criteria are identical to those for young people. Atypical depression has specific features, including general, non-psychiatric symptoms: complaints of pain, gastrointestinal and osteoarticular symptoms, sleep and appetite problems, and cognitive complaints. Psychotic symptoms are common, with delusions of melancholy, prejudice, persecution, and even Cotard's syndrome. In the presence of non-specific non-psychiatric symptoms or a change in behavior, suspect a characterized depressive episode and look for mood sadness and suicidal ideation.

As in adults, sport in children presents macrotraumatic risks (fractures, wounds, etc.) which are not specific to sport. However, intensive sport can also cause microtrauma, or ""overuse"" pathologies, linked to the repetition of sporting activities. This is the case for adults (tendinopathies, fatigue fractures, etc.) and children.

The main pathologies in children appear during growth peaks, at a time when the conjugation cartilages are particularly active. This pain around the growth plate is known as osteochondrosis, and is due to disturbances in ossification and is linked to the mechanical factors generated by sporting movements: tendon traction on the apophyseal cores, impact on the growth plate, shearing of the epiphyseal growth plates. The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.

The two most frequent locations are:

- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease. Appears most frequently around the age of 9-10.

- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease. A common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.

These pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localized in the growth plate. X-rays may be used to complete the assessment.

Treatment consists of a period of sports rest. Only the most severe cases require immobilization and offloading.

## Diagnosis of Death Prior to Removal from a Deceased Person

The definition of death is the result of a social agreement, which varies over time. Historically, death was recognized through the inanimate or cold corpse. Later, the notion of death due to cardiac arrest emerged, followed by encephalic death.

In 1959, Mollaret and Goulon defined encephalic death, but it was not officially recognized until 1968 in the circular legalizing the removal of organs from a subject in a state of encephalic death (the Jeanneney circular).

Today, there are two recognized ways of being dead, as stated in Decree no. 96-1041 of 2 December 1996 on the determination of death prior to the removal of organs, tissues, and cells for therapeutic or scientific purposes:

1. **Patient in Cardiac Arrest (Clinical Criteria):**
   - Absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity with no response to stimulation.
   - Abolition of all brain stem reflexes.
   - Absence of spontaneous ventilation.
   - In this case, samples must be taken rapidly.

2. **Patient in a State of Encephalic Death:**
   - No spontaneous ventilation in hypercapnia test.
   - Two EEGs with no detectable activity 4 hours apart, each recorded for at least 30 minutes, and/or cerebral angiography showing the absence of effective circulation.
   - In these cases, sampling may be deferred, and the dead body maintained in a circulatory and ventilatory state to preserve the quality of the organs. This condition is an important source of organs, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the context of a donation policy.

It is important to be familiar with the Maastricht classification and the questions it raises:

- People in circulatory arrest, declared dead on admission (Maastricht category I).
- People in circulatory arrest with effective cardiac massage and mechanical ventilation, but without recovery of circulatory activity (Maastricht category II).
- People for whom a decision has been taken to limit or stop treatment due to the prognosis of the pathologies that led to their admission to intensive care (Maastricht category III).
- People who have died of brain death and suffered irreversible circulatory arrest during intensive care (Maastricht category IV).

Encephalic death is little known to the general public; it conveys complex emotional representations for relatives because the body is ventilated and moving. Additionally, there is a fear that the body will be removed when there is still a chance of life. It is crucial to be clear with family and friends and establish death as a real, irreversible state. Listening, explaining, and supporting them is essential. There is a strong need for educational clarification on two levels: firstly, prior to any death, for all citizens and the general public, and secondly, at the time of death, for the next of kin.

## A Special Case: Organ Donation and the Medico-Legal Obstacle

- If there is a ""medico-legal obstacle"" at the time of death, this is not an obstacle or a prohibition on organ removal.
- However:
  - Agreement of the Public Prosecutor is required (role of the forensic pathologist is crucial).
  - The donation process can sometimes be compatible with the medical-legal process.
  - The removal(s) with a view to donation must not involve areas or organs necessary for the expert assessment of the autopsy.
  - The question of proof and justice takes precedence over the logic of donation.",1.0,9.054285714285715,False,True,0.6682356595993042,0.0,b,False,1,1

- Collecting and processing data on health status for epidemiological purposes via correspondents in the national public health network (RNSP).
- Examples include monitoring the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in certain bacterial species (e.g., Escherichia coli and β-lactams, enterococci and glycopeptides), the incidence of notifiable diseases (e.g., invasive meningococcal infections, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis), and vaccination coverage in the population.

**2. Health Watch and Vigilance**

- Analyzing and updating knowledge of health risks, their causes, and trends.
- Detecting risk factors likely to modify or alter the health of the population.

**3. Health Warning**

- Informing the Minister for Health of any threat to public health.
- Making recommendations to prevent or mitigate the threat.

**4. Contributing to the Management of Health Crisis Situations**

- For example, in the event of an alert linked to an emerging virus (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), SPF is responsible for validating the criteria defining a suspect case when a patient presents as a possible case.

Its fields of action cover communicable infectious diseases, the effects of the environment on health, work-related risks, chronic diseases and trauma, as well as international health risks, whether infectious or not.

**Definitions:**

- Hyponatremia: [Na+] < 135 mmol/L; Severe hyponatremia (biological definition) = < 120 mmol/L.
- The diagnosis of intracellular hyperhydration (ICH) is biological: hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality.
- Hyponatremia reflects plasma hypo-osmolality (POsm < 280 mOsm/kg). It is therefore the consequence of excess water. It is associated with intracellular hyperhydration (ICH). The increase in intracellular volume is due to a transfer of water from the extracellular sector to the intracellular sector as a result of plasma hypo-osmolality. Hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality is explained by a relative water content higher than the sodium stock, which may be normal (pure HIC), increased (HIC + HEC = global hyperhydration), or decreased (HIC + DEC).

**Clinical Presentation:**

- The clinical presentation of a hydrocele is that of an enlarged, non-painful, non-inflammatory bursa. In adults, the increase in volume is progressive.
- The testicle is often not perceived because of the volume of fluid surrounding it. The hernial orifices are free.
- Positive transillumination helps in the diagnosis of a hydrocele since the application of a light source behind the scrotum allows light to pass through, unlike an inguinal hernia or a tumour (313).
- In children, the hydrocele is due either to the persistence of the peritoneovaginal canal, known as a communicating hydrocele, or, as in adults, to a reaction to an inflammatory, tumoral, or traumatic phenomenon. In this case, it reflects a failure to resorb the liquid secreted by the vagina (known as a non-communicating hydrocele). The increase in volume is progressive.
- In children, the communicating nature is suggested by the variations in volume during the day, the increase in symptoms when standing, and the possibility of expelling the fluid by squeezing the bursa.
- Sudden tension (often coinciding with a viral infection in children) may be painful, and the skin may be bluish. In this situation, the differential diagnosis of strangulated hernia or torsion of the spermatic cord may be raised.
- In adults, it is common and is due to a defect in the resorption of fluid secreted by the vagina (non-communicating).
- The clinical presentation of a cord cyst is that of a non-painful swelling suspended above and independent of the testicle.
- Hydrocele or cord cyst are not emergencies.",0.8333333333333334,11.096666666666668,False,True,0.7670795917510986,0.0,c,False,4,4

Venous approaches are a major source of iatrogenia (""Prescribing and monitoring a vascular approach (SD-271)""). This is why:

- Venous ports should be removed as soon as possible to limit iatrogenicity.
- Their indication and maintenance must be reviewed daily in light of the treatments and monitoring required.

**Complications during follow-up**

These complications may be locoregional or general. They can be mechanical, thrombotic, or infectious. Their frequency depends on:

- Location
- The clinical context
- The time required to install the equipment

**Infectious complications**

Infection of the equipment can lead to bacteremia (""Positive blood culture (SD-190)"") and secondary foci. Early infections are most often related to insertion and late infections to handling: importance of asepsis during insertion and use (""Preventing healthcare-associated infections (SD-311)"").

It is essential to add fats (butter or vegetable oils) to all savory dishes for infants, whether homemade or in commercial jars, to meet their high lipid requirements.

When a meal is fully diversified, around the age of 4-6 months, follow-on formulas replace infant formulas.

== Definitions ==

The French Public Health Code (article L1142-1) provides for two liability regimes in medical law:

- A fault-based liability regime
- No-fault liability

The aim of no-fault liability is to compensate the victim (or their heirs) for the loss suffered ""without having to prove fault"" on the part of the person who caused the loss.

== Role of ONIAM ==

In the event of a medical accident, the victim (or their heirs) may refer the matter to the Commission de Conciliation et d'Indemnisation (CCI) in their region. In the case of no-fault liability, the victim will be compensated by the Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux, des Affections Iatrogènes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) on the basis of national solidarity.

The ONIAM's mission is to organize a system of ""out-of-court,"" rapid, and free compensation for victims of medical accidents, whether at fault (in the event of insurance failure) or not, ""without going to court.""",1.0,9.081818181818182,False,True,0.7482761740684509,0.0,b,False,5,2

**Title:** Sampling Methods  
**Description:** How to Define Sampling Methods  
**Rubric:** Definition  

It is often impossible to study a given population as a whole. We then examine a subset of individuals (or sample) to deduce, from the observations made on this sample, what exists in the target population.

A sample must be selected to be as representative as possible of the source population from which it is drawn. To achieve this, there are various sampling methods:

- **If a sampling frame (exhaustive list of individuals in the source population) is available:**

  - Exhaustive recruitment: if possible, all the individuals listed are recruited.
  - Random draw:
    - Simple random sampling
    - Stratified survey: the source population is divided into sub-populations according to a categorical variable (for example, age categorized into 5 modalities, i.e., strata: <18 years, 18-34 years, 35-49 years, 50-64 years, 65 years and over) and individuals are drawn at random within each sub-population. The aim is to ensure that all 5 age categories are represented in the sample drawn.
    - Cluster sampling: not individuals but collective units (clusters) are drawn (e.g., hospital services, departments, schools, etc.) and all the individuals in the collective unit drawn are included.

- **No survey database available:**

  - Consecutive recruitment: individuals are included as and when they are presented at the inclusion centers and throughout the inclusion period. Ensures good representativeness of the source population if refusals to participate or non-response are low.
    - Exhaustive if possible
    - Otherwise: random or systematic selection (1 in 2 or 3, etc.)
  - Quota method: consists of ensuring that a sample is representative by assigning it a similar structure (according to certain characteristics, for example: age, gender, department of residence, etc.) to that of the source population. This is a non-random method (widely used by survey institutes), which means that the probability of each individual belonging to the sample is unknown, which prevents the variance from being estimated correctly and therefore the precision of the estimates.
  - Sample of convenience: individuals are included in the study for practical reasons of accessibility, cost, logistics, etc. This method should be avoided because it is very likely to result in a sample that is not representative of the source population.",1.0,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.7981002330780029,0.0,c,False,5,1

**Description:** Knowing the mechanisms of action.

**Rubric:** Management.

==Hypolipidemics: Understanding the Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure==

Cholesterol-lowering drugs include Statins (Simvastatin, Pravastatin, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin), Ion exchange resins (Cholestyramine), Ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab).

Hypotriglyceridemics include Fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil) and Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oils).

==Mechanisms of Action==

===Cholesterol-lowering Agents===

- **Statins:** These HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduce hepatic cholesterol synthesis and increase the turnover of hepatic LDL receptors, stimulating the activity of LDL receptors and thus the capture of LDL by hepatocytes.
- **Cholestyramine:** A bile salt chelator that prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, reduces the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors, leading to increased uptake of LDL lipoproteins by hepatocytes.
- **Ezetimibe:** Reduces the absorption of enterocyte cholesterol and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors.
- **PCSK9 inhibitors:** Promote renewal of hepatic LDL receptors.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** PPAR alpha receptor agonists that reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase lipolysis, triglyceride catabolism, HDL production, and their return to the liver.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis and increase triglyceride catabolism.

==Indications==

The prescription of a hypolipidemic drug is always preceded by 3 to 6 months (primary prevention) or associated (secondary prevention) with a phase of hygiene and dietary measures.

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia alone or in combination.
- **Resin:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination.
- **Ezetimibe:** Isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Severe hypercholesterolemia, secondary prevention if LDL-C > 0.70 g/L under maximum tolerated lipid-lowering treatment.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Alone in the case of isolated hypertriglyceridemia, possibly combined with a statin in the case of mixed hyperlipidemia.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** In combination with a fibrate if ineffective.

==Undesirable Effects==

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Myalgias, rare rhabdomyolysis, increased transaminases, rare drug-induced hepatitis, increased risk of type 2 diabetes.
- **Resin:** Constipation, nausea, epigastralgia, reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
- **Ezetimibe:** Myalgias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Rare pain, hemorrhage, hematoma at the injection site, upper respiratory symptoms, pruritus.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Myalgias, cramps, muscular fatigue, rare drug-induced hepatitis, increased biliary lithogenesis, skin allergy.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Digestive effects.

==Drug Interactions==

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Interaction with molecules metabolized by cytochrome CYP 3A4 and CYP2C9, increased risk of hemorrhage with VKAs, disruption of immunosuppressant pharmacokinetics.
- **Resin:** Reduced absorption of medicines if taken simultaneously.
- **Ezetimibe + Fibrates:** Potentiation of the risk of adverse effects and biliary lithiasis.
- **PCSK9 inhibitors:** None described.
- **Cholestyramine:** Decreased intestinal absorption of oral anticoagulants, digitalis, and fat-soluble vitamins.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Increases the duration of action of oral anticoagulants, risk of pharmacokinetic interference with many molecules.
- **Omega-3 fatty acids:** None.

==Monitoring Procedures==

For all lipid abnormalities, monitoring is conducted 4-8 weeks after treatment initiation, depending on the drug type.

===Cholesterol-lowering Drugs===

- **Statins:** Clinical monitoring for myalgias, biological monitoring for hepatic transaminases and CPK.
- **Resin:** Clinical monitoring for constipation.
- **Ezetimibe:** Clinical monitoring for digestive disorders.
- **PCSK9 inhibitor:** Clinical monitoring for local reactions at injection sites.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

- **Fibrates:** Biological monitoring for hepatic transaminases, CPK, creatininemia, and INR if treated with VKAs.
- **Omega 3 fatty acids:** Clinical monitoring for digestive problems.

==Main Causes of Failure==

Failure is an inappropriate term for lipid-lowering treatment; ineffectiveness or intolerance would be more appropriate. Poor compliance with treatment may be encouraged by poor tolerance (muscular with statins, ezetrol or fibrates; digestive with Cholestyramine and omega-3s).

Red yeast rice (Monascus purpureus) has no marketing authorization for hypercholesterolemia but contains variable quantities of lovastatin.

Confusion results from moderate impairment of alertness. The diagnostic approach is therefore similar to that for coma. The stages are as follows:

- **General Clinical Examination:** Includes vitals, O2 saturation, blood sugar, lateral tongue bite, search for a cause of acute pain (wounds, urinary globe, fecal impaction), traces of injections, etc.

- **Neurological Examination:** Assess alertness, pupils, meningeal syndrome, focal signs, signs of encephalopathy (asterixis), and clonia.

- **Patient History:** Reconstitute the patient's history, including any treatment, alcoholism or drug use, neurocognitive disorders, by questioning relatives, first aiders, the attending physician, and obtaining medical documents.

- **Systematic Paraclinical Examinations:** Includes increased creatinine, dyscalcaemia, dyskalaemia, dysnatremia, elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP); urine dipstick (leukocytes, nitrites); ECG; usually add ECBU, liver biology.

  - Anticoagulant treatment
  - Recent head injury
  - Even in the absence of focal signs, a brain scan will usually be necessary before a lumbar puncture in the case of a major confusional syndrome with fluctuating vigilance (disturbed consciousness = contraindication to LP without imaging).

== General ==

A bullous dermatosis should be suspected clinically in the presence of skin lesions such as bullae, post-bullous erosion, wet-linen detachment, and Nikolsky's sign (detachment of the epidermis on rubbing the peri-lesional normal skin).

The medical approach to bullous dermatosis should always distinguish between autoimmune mechanisms and all other causes of bullous dermatosis.

There are two places in the skin where a bubble can form: a bubble is intra-epidermal when the cleavage occurs in the epidermis (roof and floor of the bubble in the epidermis) and a bubble is sub-epidermal when there is a cleavage under the epidermis (roof of the bubble consisting of the entire epidermis and floor in the dermis).

The subepidermal bulla is usually taut, and the intraepidermal bulla is flaccid and fragile.

# Know the Objectives and Principles of Materiovigilance

## Definition and Objectives of Materiovigilance

The aim of materiovigilance is to monitor incidents or risks of incidents resulting from the use of medical devices (MDs) after they have been placed on the market. It applies to all medical devices, regardless of their class or state of sterility.

The aim of material vigilance is to ensure the safety of patients and users by:

- Monitoring medical devices after they have been placed on the market
- Preventing the (re)occurrence of incidents and risks of incidents involving medical devices
- Taking appropriate preventive and/or corrective action

## Organisation of Materiovigilance

Materiovigilance is organised at three levels: national, regional, and local.

### National Level

At the national level, materiovigilance is the responsibility of the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM). The ANSM:

- Records and investigates incidents and potential incidents reported to it
- Informs manufacturers and takes public health decisions if necessary, and informs the various parties involved
- Handles downstream alerts (batch withdrawals, safety information, etc.) from manufacturers
- Maintains its national register of local pharmacovigilance correspondents

### Regional Level

At the regional level, the regional materiovigilance coordinator (CRMRV):

- Ensures the regional assessment of material vigilance and reactovigilance reports
- Alerts the ANSM in the event of a potential signal constituting a threat to public health
- Coordinates and leads the regional network of local material vigilance correspondents (CLMV) and reactovigilance correspondents (CLRV)
- Provides expertise and support to Regional Health Agencies, CLMVs, CLRVs, and healthcare professionals in the field of material vigilance
- Takes part in the ANSM's permanent scientific committee on material vigilance
- Leads or participates in investigations or work carried out by the ANSM

### Local Level

Local material safety correspondents (CLMV):

- Report incidents related to a medical device
- Raise awareness of material vigilance among users
- Record and disseminate downstream alerts",1.0,9.655000000000001,False,True,0.729830265045166,0.0,d,False,4,3

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose Rib Fractures in Children and Adults  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**

A rib fracture is defined radiologically by a break in bone continuity at the non-cortical edges. On a chest X-ray, there is a break in the continuity of the line running along the upper and lower edges of the ribs. The lateral segment is most often affected, and multiple fractures occur in more than half the cases. In one out of two cases, a rib fracture is not detected on standard X-rays. CT scans are more sensitive in identifying rib fractures. Any displaced rib fracture should be scanned for pneumothorax, haemothorax, or laceration of the lung parenchyma.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity. A costal flap is defined by the presence of two fracture sites involving at least three successive ribs. On clinical examination, a paradoxical movement of the hemithorax is observed. A rib flap is a serious injury often requiring intensive care and sometimes surgical treatment.

Damage to the first three ribs is a marker of high-energy trauma and may be associated with vascular or nerve damage (brachial plexus). Involvement of the 8th to 11th costal arches should prompt a search for an upper abdominal injury (hepatic or splenic).

=Calcium Channel Blockers: Understanding the Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure=

These drugs are commonly called ""calcium channel blockers"" or ""calcium antagonists,"" but the more accurate term is ""calcium channel blockers.""

== Drug Classes ==

- Calcium antagonists with a mixed cardiac and vascular effect: verapamil and diltiazem.
- Dihydropyridines with a predominantly vascular effect; INN ""-dipine"": e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine.

== Mechanism of Action ==

Calcium channel blockers bind to cardiac and/or vascular membrane L-type calcium channels. This binding leads to a reduction in the inflow of calcium into the cardiomyocyte (inotropic, dromotropic, and negative chronotropic effect) and/or into the smooth muscle cell (peripheral, coronary, and cerebral vasodilatation).

== Indications ==

- Hypertension, as first-line treatment
- Stable angina
- Verapamil and diltiazem: paroxysmal junctional tachycardias and certain supraventricular rhythm disorders.
- Verapamil: post-infarction if beta-blockers are contraindicated
- Nifedipine: symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon
- Nimodipine: prevention of neurological deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm after meningeal hemorrhage.

== Undesirable Effects ==

- **Dihydropyridines and less frequently verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Flushing, headaches
  - Peripheral edema

- **Specific to verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Bradycardia, conduction disorders
  - Heart failure

== Drug Interactions ==

- **Dihydropyridines:**
  - Avoid grapefruit juice, which can cause overdose.

- **Verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Pharmacokinetic interactions: CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, responsible for multiple drug interactions (atorvastatin and simvastatin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, ergot derivatives, dabigatran, etc.).
  - Pharmacodynamic interactions: contraindicated in combination with beta-blockers, bradycardia drugs, antiarrhythmics, etc.

== Contraindications ==

- **Verapamil and diltiazem:**
  - Heart failure
  - Bradycardia, sinus dysfunction, and untethered second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease transmitted by drinking water.

**Taeniasis**  
Taeniasis is a cestodosis, cosmopolitan for ""Taenia saginata"" and tropical for ""Taenia solium."" These flatworms release rings containing eggs in patients' feces. Humans become infected by ingesting eggs (fecal-oral transmission) or larvae contained in undercooked or uncooked meat from intermediate hosts (beef for ""T. saginata"" and pork for ""T. solium""). Ingestion of T. solium eggs leads to cysticercosis, which involves the migration of cysticerci into tissues, with the neurological form being serious. Ingestion of larvae leads to adult tapeworms in the digestive tract.

**Trichinellosis**  
Trichinellosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis, and humans are accidental hosts. Infection occurs by eating raw or undercooked meat contaminated with encysted larvae. Once ingested, the larvae travel to the striated muscles. Clinical symptoms typically include febrile polymyositis and facial edema. The course can be serious, even fatal, in the early phase of larval dissemination.

**Anisakidosis**  
Anisakiasis is a zoonosis of the cold seas. Humans are accidental hosts, contracting the disease by ingesting raw, marinated, or undercooked fish infested with larvae.

The practice of anaesthesia is governed by safety decrees included in the public health code.

In the event of a scheduled procedure requiring general or locoregional anaesthesia:

1. A pre-anaesthetic consultation, carried out at least 2 days before a scheduled operation, valid for 1 month (unless anaesthetic advice is sought).  
2. A pre-anaesthetic visit carried out within 24 hours prior to a scheduled operation.  
3. The resources required to carry out the anaesthetic procedure. The anaesthetic process for a planned procedure requiring general or locoregional anaesthesia is detailed in the process overview.  
4. Continuous monitoring after the procedure.  
5. An organisation capable of dealing with complications arising from the operation or anaesthesia at any time.  

The anaesthetic process as a whole is summarised in the preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. The anaesthetic process is identical for both general and locoregional anaesthesia.

**Rubric:** Definition

**Interaction:** Occurs when the association between an exposure and a health phenomenon varies according to the level of another factor, known as effect modification, called the interaction factor.

- The interaction factor must not be confused with a confounding factor: the presence of a confounding factor can produce (or amplify) the association under study even though it does not exist, or mask (or reduce) it when it does exist.
- To account for an interaction factor, we can perform:
  - A stratified analysis.
  - The introduction of an interaction term into a multivariate model.
- The interaction test is necessary to determine whether the effect is modified in a statistically significant way, i.e., whether there is a significant difference in the association between the levels of the interaction factor (the null hypothesis is the absence of interaction, the alternative hypothesis is the existence of an interaction).
- Example: Study evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer (fictitious figures):

**Confounding Factor:**

- Men: RR = 2.67
- Women: RR = 2.05

Sex is a confounding factor here: when stratified by sex, the association between smoking and lung cancer decreases, but the estimated RR is approximately the same in each stratum.

**Interaction Factor:**

- Inhalation: RR = 2.43
- No Inhalation: RR = 1.20

The fact of inhaling smoke is an interaction factor here: the estimate of the association between smoking and lung cancer is not the same depending on whether or not the smoke is inhaled.",0.3333333333333333,17.244285714285713,False,True,0.7997887134552002,0.0,a,False,5,1

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Two main mechanisms lead to hyperuricaemia:  

- A renal and/or intestinal elimination defect.  
- Excess production of uric acid (rare).  

The formation of sodium urate crystals results from chronic hyperuricaemia in excess of 360 µmol/l (60 mg/l), the threshold for saturation of plasma with sodium urate at 35°C (extremity temperature). As this crystallisation phenomenon is reversible, lowering uricemia below this value allows the crystals to dissolve. This value also corresponds to the 'target' uricemia that should be reached after initiation of a hypouricemic treatment.  

The microcrystals of UMS released into the joints are responsible for acute joint attacks and, over time, for the formation of tissue deposits of UMS in clusters, known as gouty tophus. In the urine, the pH can be acidic (below 6), allowing the formation of lithiasis, made up of uric acid in the case of hyperuricuria, which can lead to acute attacks of renal colic, and potential uric nephropathy in the case of chronicity.  

**Gout Classification**

Gout is usually:  

- **Primary:** Familial with a male predominance. Various elements of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with gout: obesity with increased abdominal circumference (> 94 cm in European men and 88 cm in women), arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia with reduced HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia. Patients with gout should therefore be considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, which explains the excess mortality observed. Gout occurring before the age of 35 is possible in 10-15% of cases. It should be investigated for a genetic origin with abnormalities in the genes encoding uric acid transporters in the renal tubules (URAT1, ABCG2).  

- **Secondary to:**  
  - Chronic renal failure, which reduces uric acid excretion.  
  - Several years' use of a drug that reduces urinary uric acid excretion, particularly thiazide diuretics, furosemide or etacrynic acid, acetazolamide, but also cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin or certain anti-tuberculosis drugs (ethambutol and pyrazinamide).

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management

Four areas: 1) hygiene care, 2) local anti-inflammatory treatment, 3) emollients, 4) therapeutic education.

### 1) Non-aggressive hygiene care for cleansing and avoidance of aggravating factors:
- Use a mild, unscented soap-free gel instead of soap.
- Reduce the frequency of washing skin (once every 2 days or once a day).
- Avoid prolonged hot baths.
- Apply an emollient after washing on non-inflammatory skin.
- Favor soft textiles and avoid wool.
- Do not overheat the home and avoid over-covering children, as home heating may aggravate the condition.

### 2) Local anti-inflammatory treatment: Dermocorticoids
Dermocorticoids (DC) have anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antimitotic actions. They are effective in the short term against atopic dermatitis (AD) flare-ups, though long-term efficacy studies are rare. DCs are classified by potency (very strong, strong, moderate, weak) and form (cream, ointment, lotion, gel).

**Choice of DC depends on four criteria:** age, location of lesions, extent to be treated, and oozing nature of lesions.

**Choice of galenical:**
- Ointment for dry, lichenified skin areas.
- Cream for oozing areas, folds, and large skin surfaces.
- Lotion for hairy areas and folds (rarely used on children).
- Scalp gel (rarely used in children).

**Choice of activity level:**
- Very strong DCs are contraindicated for infants, young children, and on the face, folds, and seat.
- High-activity DCs in short courses (4 to 7 days) are indicated for children on lichenified lesions, extremities, and lesions resistant to moderate-activity DCs.
- Moderate-activity DCs are used on the face and body of infants and children.
- Low-activity DCs are not recommended due to low efficacy.

**Number of applications per day:**
A single application per day is as effective as multiple applications and aids treatment adherence.

**Quantity to be applied:**
No maximum quantity is recommended during initial treatment. Maintenance treatment should not exceed 30 g/month of moderate-activity DC for children and 60 g/month for adults. Using a strong dermocorticoid twice a week on usually affected areas for 4 months can reduce flare-ups without side effects, suitable for chronic AD with frequent flare-ups.

### 3) Emollients
Emollients improve skin dryness and temporarily restore the skin's barrier function. Their use is recommended from the first symptoms of skin dryness and as maintenance treatment throughout AD, regardless of severity.

**Precautions for use:**
- Interrupt use during highly inflammatory flare-ups due to poor tolerance.
- Adapt galenics to patient preferences.
- Use fragrance-free and preservative-free products to avoid contact sensitization. Note: Emollients are not reimbursed by health insurance, except for atopiclair®, generics of dexeryl© (reimbursable at 15%), and magistral preparations reimbursed in the absence of an available equivalent.

### 4) Therapeutic education
The aim is to teach patients to live optimally with a chronic disease. It involves providing information and learning techniques by healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, psychologists) through consultations and/or small group meetings. The goal is to help patients and families become more independent, adhere to treatment, and combat corticophobia.

**Other treatments:**
- Oral antihistamines (anti-H1): No proven efficacy on pruritus in the acute phase, except for hydroxyzine, a sedative anti-H1, during flare-ups in young children with sleep disorders.
- Topical immunomodulator: Tacrolimus (in France) is indicated for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis flare-ups in children and adults where dermocorticoids are resistant or contraindicated (especially facial lesions).
- Systemic treatments for severe forms: phototherapy, cyclosporine, dupilumab, JAK inhibitors. General corticosteroid therapy is not indicated due to the risk of rebound upon discontinuation.",1.0,9.655000000000001,False,True,0.758811354637146,0.0,a,False,2,4

- The thresholds for leucocyturia are only of value in cases other than those listed below. In fact, all these elements can be a source of leucocyturia outside of any infectious process:
  - Recent urinary tract manipulation
  - Presence of endo-urinary material
  - Presence of a foreign body (stone, tumour)

- The accepted threshold for significant leucocyturia is ≥ 10<sup>4</sup> /mL.
- The threshold for significant bacteriuria in men is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL.
- The threshold for significant bacteriuria in women is set at 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL, except for E. coli and S. saprophyticus, for which the threshold is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL.

- Whatever the case, the clinical situation always takes precedence over these different thresholds, and the diagnosis of UTI should not be ruled out if the clinical situation is obvious.
- Genuine UTIs can have negative leucocyturia (immunodepression, etc.).

- On the other hand, bacteriuria with leucocyturia in the absence of symptoms should not lead to treatment because it is a case of urinary colonisation.
- Finally, remember that the ECBU is not an infallible test and that in 10 to 15% of cases, it proves negative even though the infection is clinically proven (bacteria ""decapitated"" by antibiotic therapy, ECBU performed incorrectly, etc.).",1.0,13.371818181818181,False,True,0.7511758804321289,0.0,b,True,4,4

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT): indicated in cases of macular anomaly at the back of the eye (drusen, haemorrhage, vitreomacular traction, macular hole, epimacular membrane, etc.). It is increasingly requested as part of the pre-operative cataract assessment. OCT may also be centered on the optic nerve head and indicated in cases of glaucoma or neuro-ophthalmological pathology.

- Fluorescein angiography: indicated in cases of retinal pathology (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], diabetes, central retinal vein occlusion [CRVO], central retinal artery occlusion [CRCAO], etc.).

- Angiography with indocyanine green (ICG): indicated in cases of AMD or inflammatory pathology of the posterior segment (posterior uveitis).

- Electrophysiology (electroretinogram [ERG], electro-oculogram [EOG], visual evoked potentials [PEV]): the ERG and EOG are useful for diagnosing retinal dystrophies, while the PEV are useful for diagnosing optic neuropathies.

- Ocular ultrasound: in A mode, its main purpose is to assess the length of the eyeball (in particular to determine the power of the implant during cataract surgery in patients with a very dense cataract); in B mode, its main indication is to detect a possible retinal detachment in the event of an ocular media disorder (cataract or vitreous haemorrhage), or to locate an intraocular foreign body or help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.",0.2,12.286666666666669,False,True,0.7868704199790955,0.0,d,False,3,2

Pregnant women are monitored for toxoplasmosis by monthly serological screening: toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM testing is mandatory when pregnancy is declared (unless previous maternal immunity has been documented).

In non-immune women, serology should be repeated monthly until delivery, due to the high frequency of inapparent forms of maternal toxoplasmosis (80%).

The steps to be taken in the event of positive maternal serology are as follows:

1. **Dating Maternal Contamination**  
   - It's straightforward if seroconversion occurs during serological monitoring.
   - If serology is positive with the presence of IgG and IgM in early pregnancy, the IgG avidity index should be used as a guide: a high value indicates a long-standing infection. A reference laboratory should also be called in to repeat all the maternal samples to assess how far the infection has progressed and when it occurred.

2. **Confirmed Seroconversion During Pregnancy**  
   - The patient should be referred to a Centre Pluridisciplinaire de Diagnostic Prénatal (CPDPN) for further treatment. Anti-parasitic treatment will be initiated as soon as seroconversion is diagnosed.

**Epidemiology:**

- Scarlet fever is linked to the erythrogenic toxin of Group A Streptococcus (GAS = Streptococcus pyogenes).
- Predominantly affects children aged 5 to 10 and occurs more often in winter.
- Transmitted human-to-human via the respiratory route (oropharyngeal secretions, droplets).
- Several types of GAS produce different erythrogenic toxins, making it possible to have multiple types of scarlet fever.
- 80% of adults are immune to different types of toxin.

**Prevention:**

- Eviction from the community up to 48 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy.
- Oral antibiotic prophylaxis for subjects at risk of invasive infection (refer to HCSP opinion on invasive GAS infections).

(Note: Scarlet fever is not an invasive GAS infection but justifies antibiotic prophylaxis in subjects at risk.)

**Clinical Features:**

Two phases:

- **Pre-eruptive (Invasion):** High fever, marked general signs, erythematous or erythematopultaceous angina with a positive rapid diagnostic test, and cervical adenopathy preceding the eruption by about 24 hours.
- **Eruptive (6 days):** Diffuse erythema, confluent without a gap of healthy skin, with a granular appearance to the touch. Erythema is more marked in the flexion creases (axillary and inguinal), regressing with desquamation in large flaps (glove fingers). Accompanied by mucosal involvement (enanthema) with exfoliative glossitis (tongue initially sandy, then depilated, then raspberry) and angina.

**Complications and Referral:**

Complications are similar to those of GAS angina: loco-regional complications (rare) and post-infectious complications (acute glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever), which have largely disappeared in France and high-income countries.

Treatment is the same as for GAS angina: antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin for 6 days, symptomatic analgesic treatment avoiding NSAIDs, and preventive measures as outlined above.",1.0,6.705000000000002,False,True,0.7248855233192444,0.0,a,False,4,3

Before the abortion:

- Two compulsory consultations
- A psycho-social interview is mandatory for all patients and is compulsory for minors.

Abortion is an exception to the coordinated care pathway, allowing patients to consult a doctor other than their GP. It is not necessary to see your GP before a consultation. Access to a gynaecologist or midwife is unrestricted. Abortions can also be performed by GPs in private practices up to 9 weeks' gestation.

**Rubric:** Definition

There is no legal relationship between the doctor, a public hospital employee, and the patient. Both are only legally bound to the public health establishment. In the case of acts performed by hospital doctors, it is the responsibility of the public health establishment that is brought before the administrative courts: administrative tribunal, administrative court of appeal, Conseil d'Etat.

Administrative jurisprudence has defined a typology of faults likely to engage the liability of the public service:

- **Official Misconduct:** Misconduct committed by a public official in the performance of duties, i.e., while on duty, using official resources, and without any personal interest.

- **Fault in the Organisation and Operation of the Department:** This may include inadequate supervision of patients or premises, poor maintenance of premises and equipment, poor coordination between doctors, etc.

A distinction must be made between personal misconduct or misconduct detached from the service, which gives rise to personal civil liability on the part of the perpetrator. There are two possible scenarios:

- It was committed outside the service and has no connection with the service (e.g., misconduct committed by a doctor in providing care in a private setting).

- It was committed on the ward but was not related to it because of the perpetrator's malicious intent or its exceptional seriousness (e.g., the refusal of the on-call surgeon to attend to a gunshot wounded patient even though he had been warned by the resident of the seriousness of the patient's condition).",0.2,11.500000000000004,False,True,0.7134621143341064,0.0,b,False,2,3

- BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) and its precursor NT proBNP are peptides secreted by atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes when tissue is strained. Their value reflects the average pressure regime in the heart chambers.

- Normal values of BNP (<100 pg/ml) or NT-proBNP (<300 pg/ml) make a diagnosis very unlikely in the presence of acute dyspnoea.

- BNP > 300 pg/ml or NT-proBNP with age-dependent threshold values:
  - > 450 pg/ml in subjects under 50
  - > 900 pg/ml between the ages of 50 and 75

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

== Occlusion of the Central Retinal Artery (OACR) ==

CRAO results in the following:

- Sudden, very profound drop in visual acuity (light perception)
- Pupil in areflectic mydriasis
- On fundus examination: diffuse narrowing of the arterial calibre, ischaemic white retinal oedema of the retina with cherry-red staining of the macula.
- Clinical picture varies according to the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal artery.

The younger the patient, the more exhaustive the aetiological work-up. The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:

- Embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.
- Thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.
- Coagulation disorders.

Aetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.

The treatment is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:

- In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.
- Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox®, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.
- Long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g., atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).

== Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) ==

CRVO is characterised by the following:

- Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.
- On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.
- Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form.
- Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.

In patients aged over 50, the etiological work-up is usually as simple as possible:

- To look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia.
- As well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.

In cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).

Non-ischaemic forms in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:

- Either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases).
- The persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.

Ischaemic forms, either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.

The development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to neovascular glaucoma (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).

The aim of treating a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.

No medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.

Treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation.

## Definitions

Lung opacity is a term generally reserved for chest radiography. It is characterized by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematized, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.

The etiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal, or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas. Radiographic opacities can thus be categorized into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome, and parietal syndrome.

Examples of opacities visible in pulmonary projection on chest X-ray include:
- Solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura
- Infectious pneumonia of the right middle and lower lobes
- Aneurysm of the aortic arch
- Pleural plaques in a patient exposed to asbestos

Among pulmonary opacities, a well-circumscribed round opacity (nodular syndrome) should suggest lung cancer until proven otherwise. However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass. Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.

Examples include:
- Lung nodule in right basal projection showing fatty content on CT, signaling benignity (pulmonary hamartochondroma)
- Right hilar mass found to be small cell bronchial carcinoma",0.6666666666666666,17.618461538461542,False,True,0.77913498878479,0.6608864466349283,b,False,3,3

**Description:** Cover test, corneal reflection, restitution movement, red lens examination

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

**1. Inspection:** Study of corneal reflections: The corneal reflections of a light source directed onto the eyes of a normal subject are both projected onto the center of the pupil. In the case of deviation, one of the two reflections is not centered.

**2. Examination of ocular motility in different gaze positions:** This examination is used to observe the six oculomotor muscles of each eye separately (ductions) and in combination (versions).

**3. Cover-test:** This test consists of asking the subject to stare at a point situated straight ahead in the distance. One eye is masked by a cover and then the cover is moved to the opposite eye. In subjects with normal oculomotor parallelism, no movement is observed. In the case of paralytic strabismus, a restitution movement is observed.

**4. Red lens examination:** This examination consists of placing a red lens in front of one eye (conventionally in front of the right eye) while the subject stares, with the uncovered left eye, at a white spot of light in front of them. Normally, the two images are confused in all gaze positions, and the patient sees only one point of light. In the case of an oculomotor imbalance, the two points are separated: the patient sees a red point and a white point, and the shift can be analyzed to identify the muscle in deficit.

**5. Hess-Lancaster or Lancaster test:** This test is used to diagnose oculomotor paralysis, determine the side of the paralysis, and identify the paralyzed muscle or muscles. It also allows the evolution of the paralysis to be followed by successive readings. A different colored glass is placed in front of each of the patient's eyes, a red glass in one eye and a green glass in the other. The patient is asked to move a luminous arrow, seen in red, on a screen and superimpose it on a luminous arrow, seen in green, moved by the examiner. The result is a graphical record of oculomotricity in the different gaze positions.

**6. Investigation of intrinsic motricity:** Inspection should look for pupillary inequality (anisocoria). The photomotor reflex (PMR) or pupillary response to light involves illumination of one eye causing miosis of the illuminated eye (direct PLR) and simultaneous miosis of the contralateral eye (consensual PLR).",0.5,10.154545454545456,False,True,0.5706100463867188,0.0,a,False,2,4

- **Direct Biomicroscopy:** Provides a straight image of the back of the eye with a reduced field of view, not allowing vision of relief (method used by internists).
- **Indirect Biomicroscopy:** Carried out with a slit lamp using a lens, gives an inverted image of the back of the eye, allowing vision of relief and an extended field of observation.

### 7. Examination of Oculomotricity
This examination assesses the six oculomotor muscles of each eye separately (ductions) and in combination (versions).

### 8. Additional Examinations

#### A. Visual Field (Perimetry)
The visual field is the portion of space encompassed by the eye looking straight ahead and motionless. The examination studies sensitivity to light within this space by assessing perception of light tests of varying intensity and size.  
- **Kinetic Perimetry:** Suitable for exploring peripheral deficits, such as hemianopsia and quadranopsia. It is the examination method of choice in neuro-ophthalmology.
- **Static Perimetry:** Mainly indicated for optic nerve pathology, particularly for diagnosing and monitoring chronic glaucoma. Initial alterations to the visual field are very localized and central.

#### B. Colour Vision
Useful for assessing dyschromatopsia in two circumstances:
1. Detecting congenital anomalies, such as daltonism, using coloured charts (e.g., Ishihara chart).
2. In the presence of acquired ocular conditions. The Farnsworth test is used, where the patient classifies coloured tablets. This study aids in diagnosing certain retinal disorders and optic neuropathies and is essential for monitoring treatments likely to cause retinopathy or optic neuropathy (e.g., synthetic anti-malarials, ethambutol, and isoniazid).

#### C. Fundus Angiography
Involves taking images of the fundus after intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye, either fluorescein or indocyanine green.  
- **Fluorescein Angiography:** Provides a dynamic study of retinal vascularization.
- **Indocyanine Green Injection:** Mainly used to visualize pathological choroidal vessels (e.g., vascularization of a choroidal angioma, choroidal neovessels during age-related macular degeneration).

#### D. Electrophysiological Investigations
1. **Electroretinogram (ERG):** Records the retinal action potential secondary to light stimulation using a corneal electrode. Reflects a global response of the retina, altered in extensive retinal lesions (e.g., hereditary retinal dystrophies).
2. **Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs):** Represent action potentials in the occipital cortex following light stimulation of the retina, exploring the optic pathways from the ganglion cell to the occipital cortex. Useful in diagnosing optic neuropathies, particularly in multiple sclerosis.
3. **Electro-oculogram (EOG):** Measures the activity of the pigment epithelium.

#### E. Ultrasound
- **A-mode Ultrasound:** Assesses the length of the eyeball.
- **B-mode Ultrasound:** Detects retinal detachment in ocular media disorders, locates intraocular foreign bodies, or aids in diagnosing intraocular or intraorbital tumors.

#### F. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
Used to obtain high-precision slices of the retina. Main applications include studying macular disorders (e.g., premacular membrane, macular hole, macular oedema), visualizing and localizing choroidal neovessels, and screening for chronic glaucoma by revealing optic fiber loss.

#### G. Complementary Examinations of the Anterior Segment
- **Corneal Topography:** Gathers information about the curvature or relief of the cornea, analyzing the reflection of a light pattern. Used for analyzing astigmatism, particularly in searching for keratoconus.
- **Biometry:** Combines measurements of corneal curvature (keratometry) and anterior-posterior (axial) length of the eye using an optical device. Used to calculate implant power in cataract surgery.",0.5,12.62714285714286,False,True,0.7478700876235962,0.0,b,False,5,2

**Description:** Information, education, nutritional advice, triage of gout attacks, hypouricemic treatment.

**Definitions**

Four simple principles govern management, based on patient education:

- Patients must be informed of the importance of treating a gout attack at the earliest signs. They must be able to self-treat according to a predefined treatment explained and prescribed by their doctor.

- Patients should be aware that treating an attack alone is not enough to treat gout, and should understand the importance of hypouricemic treatment, which alone can permanently relieve the symptoms of gout.

- The choice of treatment for a gout attack depends on:
  - Co-morbidities (cardiovascular disease, renal insufficiency defined by an estimated GFR <60 ml/min, diabetes, peptic ulcer, infections).
  - A history of drug intolerance.
  - Potential drug interactions.
  - The number and type of joints affected.

- The drugs that can be used to treat the crisis are:
  - Colchicine: 1 mg at the onset of the attack, followed by ½ mg an hour later, i.e., 1.5 mg on day 1 and continued on subsequent days at 0.5 mg × 2-3 per day depending on progress.
  - NSAIDs per os: at the onset of the attack and for a short period during the attack. They should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency or severe cardiovascular disease.
  - Oral corticosteroid therapy: from the onset of the attack, at a dose of 30 to 35 mg per day (prednisone equivalent) for 3 to 5 days.
  - Local corticosteroid therapy (intra-articular).
  - IL-1 inhibitors: in hospital, if other treatments have failed or are contraindicated.

Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures may be combined:

- Rest (simple brace, orthosis) and joint icing (with skin protection, which shortens the duration of access).
- Analgesic medication according to pain assessment.",0.6666666666666666,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.8278317451477051,0.0,a,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Etiologies

### Infectious Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis (Item 151)

- **Headache typical of meningeal syndrome:** Helmet-shaped, diffuse, intense, resistant to analgesics, beginning subacutely or progressively depending on the cause, gradually worsening, with nausea and vomiting (inconstant; effortless, in spurts and temporarily relieves the headache), photophobia, shotgun attitude, stiff neck (positive meningeal maneuvers, Kernig and Brudzinski signs, may be missing).
- **Isolated headache:** Chronic and insidious progression over weeks or months in the absence of diagnosis in certain infectious meningitis (e.g., tuberculosis).
- **Infectious syndrome:** Fever (may be absent).
- **If meningoencephalitis:** Headache with confusion, consciousness disorders, comitial seizures, central focal neurological deficit, cranial nerve damage.
- **Non-infectious meningitis:** Headache of a progressive meningeal syndrome (differential diagnosis of infectious meningitis, based on lumbar puncture).
- **Carcinomatous meningitis**
- **Aseptic meningitis in inflammatory diseases**

### Intracranial Hypertension Syndromes (HTIC)

- **Headache:** In the form of a helmet, diffuse, intense, morning, wakes the patient at the end of the night, exaggerated by coughing/exertion/decubitus, resistant to analgesics. Progressive onset (sometimes abrupt). With vomiting (inconstant; effortless, in spurts and temporarily relieves the headache). The headache precedes disorders of vigilance (obnubilation, confusion, then coma). Other symptoms include horizontal diplopia (VI uni or bilateral), visual eclipses (transient bilateral amaurosis, late), bilateral papilledema at the fundus. In infants: fontanel bulge, increased PC.
- **Risk:** Commitment
- **Causes:** Intracranial tumor (Item 299), pituitary adenoma (Item 244), chronic subdural hematoma (Item 344), hydrocephalus, cerebral venous thrombosis, chronic meningitis, rarely idiopathic HTIC (young, obese woman, no cause on imaging and LP).

### Intracranial Hypotension Syndromes

- **Post-dural puncture headache:** A few hours after an iatrogenic dural breach (LP, epidural, spinal anesthesia, etc.), progressive (sometimes sudden). Postural orthostatic headache which appears when standing or sitting, and disappears in less than 15 minutes when lying flat without a cushion. With nausea, sometimes vomiting, cervicalgia (in standing position).
- **Spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache:** Orthostatic postural headache in the absence of iatrogenic dural rupture.

### Acute Post-Traumatic Headache

- By definition appears less than 7 days after a head injury and may resemble a migraine or tension headache. The possibility of a more serious secondary headache (extradural hematoma, subdural hematoma, cervical artery dissection) must be systematically raised and ruled out by appropriate imaging (Item 334).

### Giant Cell Arteritis (Item 195)

- Any unusual headache in a subject >50 years of age should raise the suspicion of giant cell arteritis (Horton's disease), even in the absence of the classic picture (AEG, limb-girdle pain, bitemporal pain, indurated, warm, non-throbbing temporal artery, jaw claudication).

### Acute Blocked Sinusitis (Item 148)

- Intense, progressive or sometimes brutal headache, increased by tilting the head, decubitus, and/or pressure on the sinus regions. Pain is sometimes isolated, without nasal discharge (blocked sinusitis); fever is inconstant.

### Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma (Item 84)

- Severe periorbital pain, with ocular redness, unilateral visual disturbance (decreased acuity, light halos), and sometimes moderate areactive mydriasis.

### Carbon Monoxide (CO) Poisoning (Item 337)

- Progressive headache then dizziness, visual disturbances, asthenia, ebriety sensation, consciousness disturbances, in a winter context, defective combustion heating system.

### Drug-Induced Headache

- Headache resembling migraine or tension headache, but temporally related to the intake of a headache-inducing treatment (frequently: phosphodiesterase inhibitors).

### General Headache

- Headache without specific features, diagnosis guided by the other signs and symptoms of the causative conditions.
  - Sleep apnea syndrome (Item 110)
  - Anemia (Item 213)
  - Hypothyroidism (Item 243)

== Clinical Aspects According to Disease Stage ==

- **Acute Phase:** Acute eczema characterized by erythema, oedema, vesicles that rupture leading to oozing and crusts, pruritus, and crumbled contours.

- **Chronic Phase:** Erythematosquamous lesions and/or lichenification, which is the thickening of the skin with an irregular squared appearance.

== Location of Lesions by Age ==

- **Infants:** Lesions start on the face and scalp, extending to the sides of the limbs and trunk. The area under the nappy and mid-face area (nose) is spared.

- **Early Childhood:** Lesions are localized in the flexion creases of the limbs (knees, elbows) and often the ankles.

- **Older Children:** Frequent lichenification induced by chronic scratching.

- **Adolescents and Adults:** Lesions appear on the face and neck, with rare but typical localizations such as lips (atopic cheilitis), eyelids with possible ophthalmological complications (keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis), and lower limbs (lichenification, prurigo).

== Development ==

Atopic dermatitis (AD) most often begins in the first 12 months of life. It usually develops in winter flare-ups but can develop continuously in severe forms. Improvement or even ""cure"" often occurs in childhood, but 3 to 5% of children progress to an adult form, particularly those with a severe form. A late onset in adulthood is possible but rare, requiring a differential diagnosis to rule out other conditions such as scabies, contact eczema, or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Puberty is triggered by the hypothalamic reactivation of the GnRH (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone) pulsatility. GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). The appearance of this pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, including leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

- **In Boys:**  
  - FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
  - LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (penis, hair) and musculoskeletal changes.

- **In Girls:**  
  - LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
  - Oestrogens cause mammary, uterovaginal, and OGE development, followed by the appearance of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

Pubic hair development is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.

The increase in sex hormones enhances the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, accelerating the speed of statural growth (pubertal growth peak).",1.0,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.7869304418563843,0.0,c,False,3,4

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**  
The onset of puberty is hypothalamic, characterized by the reactivation of GnRH pulsatility (Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone). GnRH stimulates the anterior pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). This pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, including leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status, and intercurrent pathologies.

**Puberty in Boys**  
- FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume.  
- LH stimulates the production of testosterone, leading to the development of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., penis, hair) and musculoskeletal changes.

**Puberty in Girls**  
- LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens.  
- Oestrogens cause the development of mammary, uterovaginal, and external genital structures, followed by the onset of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

**Additional Factors**  
- Pubic hair development is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.  
- The increase in sex hormones enhances the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, accelerating the speed of statural growth (pubertal growth peak).",1.0,9.087500000000002,False,True,0.7792842388153076,0.0,a,False,2,4

**Title:** Identifying an abnormal mediastinal image in infants and children and prescribing a thoracic CT scan  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Abnormalities of the mediastinum in children are generally mass syndromes which may correspond to multiple causes (malformative, vascular, infectious, benign or malignant tumors). The diagnostic approach takes into account the age of the child and the topography of the lesion on the frontal thoracic X-ray, the first-line examination. If there is any doubt on the X-ray, ultrasound is the first test to be carried out in babies and young children. CT scans and MRIs are second-line examinations, mainly for tumor pathology or in older children. The younger the child, the more MRI is preferred to CT for reasons of radiation exposure. In infants, the most common lesions are malformations (bronchogenic cyst, esophageal duplication, etc.), neuroblastomas, and teratomas. In older children (over the age of 7), the most common lesions are hematological malignancies (lymphoma, leukemia).

**Identification of an Abnormal Mediastinal Image**

Reading the frontal radiograph involves locating the abnormality and identifying its topography (anterior, middle, or posterior mediastinum), which involves analyzing the contours and lines of the mediastinum. Mediastinal reflection lines are formed when the X-ray is tangent to the interface between two media of different density. The mediastinal reflection lines include paratracheal lines, posterior mediastinal line, anterior mediastinal line, para-azygo-esophageal line, paravertebral lines, and para-aortic line.

In general, a mediastinal mass present on radiography has:

- Clear external contours
- Internal contours that are not visible (because they are embedded in the normal mediastinal opacity)
- Obtuse connection angles (gently sloping) with the mediastinal opacity

Depending on its topography and size, a mediastinal mass may distort the contours of the mediastinum, repress or obliterate mediastinal lines, or determine certain characteristic signs which facilitate the diagnosis. For example:

- **Silhouette Sign:** A thymic mass in an infant obliterates the left edge of the heart, indicating its anterior location.
- **Lymphoma in a 9-year-old Child:** Enlargement of the upper borders of the mediastinum in relation to a mass syndrome of the anterior mediastinum.
- **Cervico-thoracic Sign:** A right upper mediastinal mass not silhouetted by the right border of the mediastinum, with its external limit remaining visible above the clavicle, confirming its posterior location (neurogenic tumor).
- **Iceberg Sign:** The outer edges of the mass remain visible through the abdominal opacity, indicating a pure intrathoracic location, posterior to the left cupola, as demonstrated by the CT scan. This was a neuroblastoma in a 2-year-old girl.",1.0,7.570000000000004,False,True,0.7944688200950623,0.0,d,False,3,4

Fragile X syndrome is:

- The leading cause of familial intellectual disability (Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly SD-115)
- The second most common cause of genetic intellectual disability (after trisomy 21)
- The leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder (Child and Adolescent Behaviour Disorder SD-133)

Prevalence is estimated at around 1/5,000 in men and 1/8,000 in women (2% of intellectual disabilities in boys and 1% in girls).

The estimated frequency of premutations in the general population is 1/250 in women and 1/500 in men.

In the case of small premutations (< 100 CGG), genetic investigations should be continued to look for another cause of the neurodevelopmental disorder. However, it is important to offer genetic counselling to the patient's family, as there is a high risk of genetic instability that could lead to the appearance of a complete mutation in other children (announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327, disability situation SD-345).

Not all fetuses are equal when faced with maternal smoking or passive smoking. The effect of smoking requires the interaction of multiple factors: socio-demographic, epidemiological, or genetic.

Tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 toxic products, some of which are metabolized by cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase. The genes encoding these two enzymes have been studied in mothers who smoke. In the group of low-weight children, more patients were found to have a polymorphism in one or other of these two genes.

Among the toxic substances, nicotine is the most addictive. There is a dose effect between maternal smoking and fetal impairment. However, the effect of smoking seems to be more marked in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, since patients who successfully stop smoking in the 1st trimester and 2nd trimester have newborns whose birth weight is hardly any different from that of non-smoking mothers.

Cleft lip and palate is an embryopathy that affects approximately 1 in 2000 births. It may be isolated (70%) or syndromic (30%).

Diagnosis can be made on antenatal ultrasound scans or after birth through clinical examination by inspecting the lips and palate and palpating the palate to check its integrity.

There are several types of cleft:

- **Primary cleft palate (lateralized):** More or less complete damage to the opening of the nostril, upper lip, and alveolar arch as far as the nasopalatine canal. It can be unilateral (most frequent) or bilateral.
- **Secondary cleft palate (medial):** Involvement of the nasopalatine canal as far as the uvula, resulting in communication between the oral cavity and the nasal cavities. Partial forms include cleft palate (bifid uvula).

**Interrogatory**

The interrogatory process enables:

- Confirming the diagnosis of constipation and its chronic nature.
- Identifying contributing factors (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, low-fiber diet, medication).
- Detecting symptoms suggesting a secondary cause.
- Understanding the mechanism of constipation: transit or distal (dyschezia).
- Identifying warning signs of colorectal cancer or anal canal cancer (e.g., rectal discharge, change in general condition, recent unexplained change in bowel movements).
- Assessing the impact on quality of life.

Note: It is important to be aware of the notion of ""false diarrhea in constipated patients."" In some patients with distal constipation and the presence of feces in the rectal ampulla (fecal impaction), the breakdown of these feces in the rectum can lead to ""false diarrhea,"" most often reported by the patient as episodes of sudden diarrhea following several days of constipation, with frequent repetition of this ""cycle.""

**Clinical Examination**

Examination of the abdomen may reveal tenderness in the left iliac fossa, opposite the left colon and sigmoid, where fecal matter is stored. The presence of fecal matter can be perceived. Abdominal meteorism may also be observed. The examination looks for signs of a secondary cause. A proctological examination is essential in cases of constipation.

- Examination of the anal margin to look for local lesions (e.g., hemorrhoids, fissures).
- The rectal examination ensures there are no anal or rectal lesions. It can also be used to check for the presence of abnormal matter in the rectal ampulla (fecal impaction), to assess anal sphincter tone, and to look for a rectocele.
- The ""dynamic"" perineal examination consists of examining the patient during pushing. It can reveal a problem with the contraction of the external anal sphincter (most often a lack of relaxation or paradoxical contraction during pushing) and reveal anatomical problems such as perineal descent.",1.0,14.270000000000007,False,True,0.7411789894104004,0.0,a,False,3,3

- Signs of pleurisy under tension: complete opacity of the hemithorax, mediastinal displacement towards the opposite side.

**Chest X-ray, Supine, Front View:**

- More difficult to interpret because the pleural fluid moves posteriorly, so the interface between the lung and pleura is no longer tangential but becomes perpendicular to the X-rays.

There are three main types of consumption, regardless of the type of drink involved (a drink containing approximately 10g of pure alcohol):

- **Occasional, light, or moderate consumption:** Around 1 to 2 drinks per day. There is no dysmorphic or malformative syndrome. In the case of occasional or light alcohol consumption, the scientific data are reassuring regarding the occurrence of long-term cognitive or behavioral problems. In the case of moderate drinking, studies are contradictory, but there is a risk of alteration in behavioral scores, as well as affective and/or anxiety disorders.

**Title:** Understanding the mechanisms of maternal-fetal transmission of frequently implicated viruses

**Description:** HSV, HBV, HIV, VZV

**Definitions**

**HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus)**

Severe neonatal herpes is rare, with 20-30 cases per year, but more than half of affected children die or suffer serious neurological sequelae. The main route of infection (80%) is through the infected genital tract during childbirth. In exceptional cases, infection may occur during the mother's pregnancy or postnatally from a maternal herpes infection or within the family.

The risk of contamination during childbirth is approximately:

- 50% if the primary infection occurred in the month preceding labor
- 2 to 5% if the recurrence occurred in the week preceding labor
- 1/1,000 in cases of a history of genital herpes without visible lesions
- 1/10,000 in the absence of a history of genital herpes

The risk is minimal in the absence of a known history of herpes but requires further investigation. However, as this is the most common case, the majority of neonatal herpes cases are observed in this situation. This is because:

- 3 to 5% of women have a known history of recurrent genital herpes
- 20% of women are seropositive for the HSV2 virus and may excrete the virus intermittently; genital herpes is commonplace but often goes unrecognized

**HBV (Hepatitis B Virus)**

One percent of pregnant women are affected. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by measuring the maternal plasma viral load:

- 90% in the presence of viral DNA (PCR test); if the viral load is very high (> 200,000 copies/ml), a hepatologist's opinion is recommended
- 10 to 20% if the viral DNA test is negative but in the absence of anti-HBe antibodies; close to 0% in the presence of anti-HBe antibodies

In the event of a high viral load, antiviral treatment should be initiated. Transmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Sero-vaccination of the child at birth is recommended, and the neonatologist should be informed.

**HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)**

Mother-to-child transmission, which is 15-20% in the absence of prenatal treatment, is now around <1% with current antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy. The virus is not teratogenic.

Vertical transmission of HIV can occur in three stages:

- Pre-partum (infection during pregnancy), where HIV passes from the mother to the fetus via the placenta
- Intrapartum (infection during childbirth)
- Post-partum (via breastfeeding); 2/3 of contaminated children are infected during childbirth

Transmission can be influenced by several factors:

- Maternal: transmission is increased before childbirth in highly immunocompromised women with clinical signs (AIDS), a high viral load, and low CD4 lymphocyte levels
- Obstetric: transmission is increased in cases of premature rupture of the membranes, placental abruption, premature delivery, and intra-uterine infection (chorioamnionitis)
- Breastfeeding: a major factor in postnatal contamination in developing countries
- Associated maternal infections: genital infections, STIs, and especially HCV-HIV-HSV co-infection

**VZV (Varicella-Zoster Virus)**

Transmission of chickenpox during pregnancy exposes the fetus to risks such as:

- Embryofetopathy: the risk is estimated at 2-2.5% for contaminations mainly before 20 days' gestation, leading to amniotic bridges, skin lesions following a dermatome, anomalies of the extremities, intrauterine growth retardation, muscular hypotrophies, limb hypoplasia, microphthalmia, cataract, chorioretinitis, microcephaly, polymicrogyria, hydrocephaly, cortical atrophy
- Shingles in the first year of life: when chickenpox is contracted between 21 and 36 weeks' gestation (and more than 3 weeks before childbirth)
- Varicella neonatorum: for a birth occurring during maternal varicella in the days surrounding the birth. Vesicles and vesicular rash (cutaneous-mucosal) may occur

In the case of maternal varicella, there is a risk of potentially serious pulmonary varicella, which warrants monitoring and awareness-raising by the attending physician (fever, pulmonary auscultation, etc.).

**Definitions**

The concentration of ionised calcium is regulated by two circulating factors: parathyroid hormone (PTH) and active vitamin D (calcitriol). The secretion of PTH by the parathyroid glands depends on whether the calcium-sensitive receptor expressed on the membrane of their cells is stimulated. Stimulation of the receptor slows down the secretion of PTH. PTH acts by mobilising calcium from the bone mineral phase and increasing tubular reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule. PTH inhibits phosphate reabsorption and stimulates calcitriol synthesis in the proximal tubule. Calcitriol, an active metabolite of vitamin D, increases the digestive absorption of calcium and phosphorus.

**Mechanisms of Hypocalcaemia**

Hypocalcaemia occurs when the net loss of calcium from the extracellular compartment exceeds the calcium intake from the intestine or bone. Hypocalcaemia therefore results from:

- An increase in calcium losses (deposits in tissues, bone transfer, urinary losses, intravascular chelation)
- A reduction in calcium entering the circulation (intestinal malabsorption, reduced bone resorption)",1.0,12.425714285714289,False,True,0.8055170178413391,0.0,b,False,2,4

Elderly patients should be aware of the risk of iatrogenic side effects, particularly from psychotropic drugs. Polymedication exposes patients to the risk of drug interactions.

For mood disorders, risk factors are more marked in the elderly: non-psychiatric co-morbidities, loss of autonomy, and stressful psycho-social events. Progress depends in part on the therapeutic strategy. The risk of suicide is high, and the number of completed suicides is higher than in younger patients.

There is a frequent association with non-psychiatric pathologies, either by increasing the risk of developing a depressive episode characterized by certain pathologies (dementia, cardiovascular pathologies, sensory impairment, cancer) or by the fact that a depressive episode increases the risk of occurrence or aggravation of certain non-psychiatric pathologies (cognitive impairment, or even progression to Alzheimer's disease or related illnesses, diabetes, coronary artery disease).

Serotonergic antidepressants are the first-line treatment. For bipolar disorder, thymoregulators are the mainstay of treatment.

For psychotic disorders, second-generation antipsychotics should be used as first-line treatment. Treatment is identical to that for adults.

For Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD), management must be comprehensive, with priority given to non-drug approaches.

**Extra-Membranous Glomerulopathy (GEM)**

**Diagnosis:**

- In over 85% of cases, there is a nephrotic syndrome, often impure.
- Diagnosis is based on renal biopsy:
  - Light microscopy:
    - Absence of proliferation
    - Normal or thickened and spiculated MBG on the outer surface
  - Immunofluorescence: Granular extramembranous deposits of IgG and C3
- GEMs often present with extramembranous deposits of IgG targeting an autoantigen expressed by podocytes, primarily the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). These anti-PLA2-R IgGs (autoantibodies) are detected in the serum.
- GEM is sometimes diagnosed without a renal biopsy when there is a combination of nephrotic syndrome and anti-PLA2R serum antibodies.

- GEM can be:
  - Primary (85% of cases)
  - Secondary (15% of cases)

**Causes of Secondary GEM:**

- Solid cancers, especially if age > 50 years:
  - Lung, breast, colon, and melanoma cancers
- Systemic lupus erythematosus:
  - Women aged 20 to 55
- Other autoimmune diseases:
  - Sjögren's syndrome, thyroiditis

- LVEF measurements can be used to classify three main types of heart failure:
  - Heart failure with reduced LVEF if LVEF ≤ 40%.
  - Heart failure with preserved LVEF if LVEF ≥ 50%.
  - Heart failure with moderately impaired LVEF if between 41% and 49%.

Depending on the patient's level of autonomy and the availability of existing aids, they may be able to live independently in their own home (or even with their family) without needing any assistance. Housing assistance can take the form of:

- Therapeutic or community flats
- Social support services (SAVS) or medical-social support services for disabled adults (SAMSAH)
- Home visits and/or household help
- Collective accommodation establishments (foyers de vie, foyers d'accueil spécialisés, foyers d'accueil médicalisé) when independent housing is not possible

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Management  

**Management Guidelines:**

- In cases of acute retention of urine due to clotting macroscopic hematuria, and in the absence of retention of urine or renal colic, it is advisable to maintain good hydration to allow the evacuation of clots and eliminate reversible favoring factors such as hemostasis disorders and anticoagulants.

- A full blood test must be carried out, including CBC, TP/TCA +/- INR, and ABO Rh group RAI.

- In the event of associated hemodynamic problems, intravenous filling should be started, and transfusion of packed red blood cells should be considered in the event of poorly tolerated deglobulation. Hemostasis disorders must be corrected simultaneously, which may involve discontinuation of an anticoagulant, correction of an overdose, or supplementation with vitamin K or PPSB.

- In case of urine retention due to bladder clotting:
  - Placement of a suprapubic catheter (KT) is contraindicated due to the risk of dissemination in case of an unrecognized underlying bladder urothelial tumor and the impossibility of unblocking and continuous bladder cleansing, which poses a risk of obstruction of the KT (insufficient caliber).
  - Placement of a double-stream bladder catheter (large bore CH>18) is recommended, with manual decapping using a syringe followed by continuous irrigation/washing with physiological saline. An ECBU is performed when the catheter is inserted.

- If manual decalcification fails, if the transfusion yield is poor, or if the patient is clinically unwell, endoscopic surgical decalcification should be considered in the operating theatre. This procedure may allow a bladder lesion to be treated or resected simultaneously.

- In cases of macroscopic hematuria originating in the upper excretory tract, clotting may lead to renal colic, which is usually self-limiting. It may sometimes be necessary to insert a ureteral stent in cases of obstructive pyelonephritis, renal failure, or resistant renal pain.",1.0,15.030000000000001,False,True,0.8439054489135742,0.0,c,False,3,3

- **Amoebiasis**

- **Toxoplasmosis**
- **Giardiasis**

### Etiologies

#### Amoebiasis

Amoebiasis is a protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is cosmopolitan but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebiasis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebiasis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues by vegetative forms of *Entamoeba histolytica histolytica*.

#### Cryptosporidiosis

Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.

#### Giardiasis

Giardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via the faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.

#### Toxoplasmosis

Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat feces and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.",1.0,7.368571428571428,False,True,0.6676369905471802,1.0,a,True,5,1

**Special Occupational Risks: Carcinogenic, Toxic for Reproduction, etc.**

- **Reinforced Individual Monitoring:**
  - **Prior to Assignment to the Workstation:** An aptitude medical examination by an occupational physician.
  - **At Least Every 4 Years:** A medical examination for fitness by an occupational physician.
  - **Intermediate Visit:** Nurse interview, possibly involving an occupational physician.
  
- **Out of Risk Workstation:**
  - **Prevention Information Visit:** Conducted on recruitment and periodically, at least every 5 years, involving a nurse interview.

Consultations carried out by the occupational physician as part of reinforced individual monitoring include a medical aptitude examination leading to the drafting of an aptitude sheet.

== Consultations Related to Work Stoppage ==

- **Resumption Visit:**
  - Mandatory after more than 60 days' absence from work.
  - Objective: To determine if working conditions need to be adapted.

- **Pre-Reinstatement Visit:**
  - Not compulsory.
  - Takes place while the employee is off work.
  - Purpose: To anticipate any difficulties upon return and to organize workstation adaptation with the employer.
  - Can be requested by:
    - The employee
    - The attending physician
    - The social security doctor
    - The occupational physician
  - Note: The employer cannot request this visit but must inform the employee of its possibility.

== Consultations at the Request of the Employee or Employer in the Event of a Problem ==

During all of these consultations, the occupational physician may make written recommendations to the employer on adapting the employee's workstation due to health conditions, while respecting medical confidentiality. Recommendations indicate necessary adaptations without providing a medical diagnosis.

Sometimes, the consultation results in the employee being declared unfit for work. This requires the employer to seek another position suited to the employee's remaining capabilities.

      - Digestive: osmotic diarrhea  
    - Renal: Hypotonic polyuria (U/P osm ≤ 1) with plasma hyperosmolality, characteristic of diabetes insipidus. Induced polyuria is compensated by polydipsia (polyuro-polydipsic syndrome), hypernatremia occurs when the patient has reduced access to water:  
      - Diabetes insipidus of central origin linked to the complete or partial absence of ADH secretion  
      - Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus characterized by a reduced or abolished renal response to ADH. Urinary osmolality is low and unaffected by the administration of synthetic ADH (dDAVP= minirin®)

The various aetiologies are suggested based on the history and examination. The general examination is supplemented by a neurological examination to look for motor deficits, pyramidal, parkinsonian or cerebellar syndromes, deep sensitivity disorders, and cognitive disorders.

**The Different Origins of Gait Disorders:**

- **Walking Disorders of Painful Origin:** The disorder is due to a pain avoidance mechanism (avoidance lameness) or a real limitation (intermittent claudication). Some pains are very specific, such as exertional myalgia and the second wind phenomenon of McArdle's disease (muscular glycogenosis).

- **Walking Disorders of Ataxic Origin:**  
  - Cerebellar ataxia: static, kinetic, and locomotor cerebellar syndrome.  
  - Vestibular ataxia: vertigo, gait deviation, maneuvers.  
  - Proprioceptive ataxia: heeling gait, hypopallesthesia.

- **Gait Disorders of Central Origin:** Central motor deficit disorder, often due to cerebrovascular accident sequelae, typically presents as hemiparesis or hemiplegia resulting in mowing, with the homolateral upper limb fixed in adduction.

- **Peripheral Gait Disorders:** Motor disorders of peripheral origin often affect the extremities (steppage) or involve muscular disorders with a symmetrical and predominantly proximal deficiency, resulting in a waddling gait.

- **Gait Disorder with Small Steps:** Parkinsonian syndrome (small-step walking, paroxysmal festination freezing), lacunar walking, or chronic hydrocephalus in adults.

**Other Walking Disorders:**

- **Dystonia:** A hyperkinetic motor disorder characterized by pseudo-stepping, painful varus equinus foot, ""heron"" gait with elevation of the knees, pseudo-spastic gait, and ""dromedary gait"" with alternative flexion-extension of the trunk. A dopa-sensitivity test should be performed.

- **Chorea:** A hyperkinetic motor disorder.

- If the patient is unconscious:
  - No oral ingestion due to the risk of aspiration.
  - Administer an IM or SC injection of glucagon (awakens in 15 minutes; side effects include nausea and vomiting) or nasal glucagon (not reimbursed). Note: Glucagon is contraindicated if the patient is on hypoglycemic sulfamide.
  - In a hospital setting, administer glucagon or a direct (slow) intravenous injection of one or two ampoules of 30% glucose solution (immediate awakening), followed by G10%.

**Prevention**

Prevention is based on patient education:

- Know the clinical signs of hypoglycaemia.
- Be familiar with the drugs that cause hypoglycaemia: sulphonamides, glinides, and insulin.
- Be aware of high-risk situations, such as:
  - A light meal without reducing insulin doses.
  - A long delay between the injection of rapid-acting insulin and the meal.
  - Heavy physical exertion without reducing insulin doses or having a snack.
  - An error in insulin dose or sulphonamide/glinide intake.
  - Resolving a hyperglycaemic situation such as an infection, stress, or corticosteroid therapy.

- In most cases, haemorrhoid treatment is a comfort treatment.
- Medicinal treatments are usually reserved for acute symptoms and offered as a short course of treatment.
- Instrumental and surgical procedures, on the other hand, constitute the basic treatment for internal haemorrhoidal disease and are reserved for specialist care.",1.0,9.054285714285715,False,True,0.7093572616577148,0.0,c,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the definition of disciplinary liability.

**Rubric:** Definition.

**Definitions**

Disciplinary liability is incurred before the bodies of the Ordre des Médecins. Disciplinary action is independent of any other action that may be taken against a doctor, whether civil or criminal.

**Misconduct and Disciplinary Sanctions**

**Disciplinary Offences**

Any breach of the rules of medical ethics constitutes a disciplinary offence. It is a violation of a moral rule rather than a strictly legal rule, whether or not it is enshrined in a text such as the Code of Medical Ethics. In principle, such misconduct is related to professional activity, but not exclusively. An act in private life may be prejudicial to the honour or morality of the profession. The rules governing medical ethics are set out in the Code of Medical Ethics (articles R.4127-1 to R.4127-112 of the Public Health Code). The fundamental principles it contains apply to all doctors registered with the Ordre des Médecins, as well as to medical interns performing locums.

This Code differs from the Penal Code, which does not set out principles but rather lists behaviours prohibited by our society (criminal offences). It is drawn up by the Conseil national de l'Ordre des médecins, which is vested with regulatory powers that are subject to the Conseil d'Etat. It is revised periodically, as it must comply with the law.

**Disciplinary Sanctions**

The penalties incurred include:
- A warning.
- A reprimand.
- A temporary ban from performing any duties remunerated by the State or public authorities.
- A temporary ban from practising (for a maximum of three years).
- Removal from the roll of the Ordre.

Temporary disqualifications may be accompanied by a suspended sentence (partial or total), which may be revoked if a new disciplinary offence is committed within the following five years. If the ban is lifted, the person concerned may ask for it to be lifted again after three years. If this is refused, they must wait three years before applying again.

**Implementation of Disciplinary Liability**

**Jurisdictions**

The competent courts are the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's regional council and, on appeal, the disciplinary chamber of the Ordre's national council. Appeals may be lodged with the Conseil d'Etat.

**Referral**

Referrals may be made to the disciplinary chamber of the regional council of the Ordre for self-employed doctors by:
- A departmental council of the Ordre.
- The national council of the Ordre.
- A doctor.
- A doctors' union.
- The director of the regional health agency.
- The prefect.
- The public prosecutor.
- The minister responsible for health.

For doctors working in the public hospital sector, the power to refer cases is limited to:
- The Conseil départemental de l'Ordre.
- The Conseil national de l'Ordre.
- The Director of the Regional Health Agency.
- The Prefect.
- The Public Prosecutor.
- The Minister for Health.

A patient's complaint against a private practitioner or hospital doctor must be referred to the Conseil départemental de l'Ordre, which is obliged to attempt conciliation. If this fails, the Conseil départemental de l'Ordre is obliged to forward the complaint to the disciplinary chamber of the Conseil régional de l'Ordre.

**Procedure**

The patient is one of the parties to the proceedings, so he or she is entitled to appeal (recours, pourvoi en cassation) and may be accompanied by a lawyer. The doctor, for his part, may be assisted before the court by a lawyer from the bar or a colleague. Proceedings before the Order's courts are adversarial; the hearing is public.",0.0,15.797142857142859,False,True,0.7746002078056335,0.0,b,False,2,3

  - Assessment of soft tissue and neurological structures (spondylodiscitis)  
  - Spondylodiscitis: reference diagnostic examination, search for complications (paravertebral abscess, spinal cord or radicular compression).  
  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: diagnostic confirmation (shows bone oedema with T1 hyposignal and T2 hypersignal), search for complications (subperiosteal or soft tissue abscesses, arthritis, associated venous thrombosis).  
  - Chronic osteitis: not systematic, extent of initial bone involvement  
  - Arthritis: rarely useful

- **Functional Imaging**  
  - Early but non-specific abnormalities  
  - Modalities: bone or marked polynuclear scintigraphy, PET scan, etc.  
  - Not systematic  
  - Spondylodiscitis: 18FDG PET scans, if MRI is contraindicated.  
  - Acute osteomyelitis in children: Technetium-99m bone scintigraphy as an alternative to MRI, especially useful for young children in whom MRI is difficult to perform (need for sedation) or in cases of clinical difficulty in locating the infection.

- Promotion of physical activity: Exercise is encouraged. Regular, prolonged physical activity (such as walking) should be at a pace that does not cause breathlessness.

- Monitoring of weight and symptoms: Regular weighing allows patients to seek advice quickly if they gain 2 to 3 kg in weight.

- Work and professional reintegration: Engage in professional activities that avoid major physical effort (e.g., handling, carrying loads, building, and public works). Certain high-risk jobs (such as lorry or public transport driver) and shifting hours should be avoided. Application for invalidity or an adapted post may be necessary depending on the disability.

**Title:** Awareness of Infection Risk in Patients with Valve Prostheses

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Identification of the Emergency

The presence of a prosthetic valve significantly increases the risk of infective endocarditis (IE). Patients with prosthetic heart valves are classified as having a high risk of infection, with the incidence of prosthesis-related IE estimated at around 5% at 5 years.

Early adverse events (AEs) occurring less than one year after implantation result from peri-operative contamination (e.g., catheter, urinary catheter, orotracheal intubation). The germs are mainly from the Staphylococcus family (Coagulase negative or Aureus).

Late infective endocarditis (IE) occurring more than one year after implantation originates from more common routes of entry for IEs (cutaneous, dental, digestive). The germs are similar to those found in AEs on native valves (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus).

Clinical monitoring of patients with valve prostheses is essential. The onset of fever associated with an unknown murmur should alert the clinician. Additionally, any prolonged fever without a warning sign should prompt a search for infective endocarditis.

The diagnostic strategy for adverse reactions (ARs) on prosthetic valves is identical to that for native valves.

Antibiotic treatment is the same as for AEs involving native valves.

The indications for surgery are discussed on a case-by-case basis, with the following conditions being particularly favorable: clinically significant prosthesis dysfunction, uncontrolled infectious syndrome despite antibiotic therapy, presence of an abscess or fistula, and IE caused by Staphylococcus Aureus.

Prevention of AEs for prosthesis wearers depends primarily on clear information being provided to the patient. It is also essential to provide the patient with a valve prosthesis wearer card.

Therapeutic education is crucial, particularly regarding signs that should prompt consultation (e.g., prolonged fever, general malaise). Blood cultures should be taken systematically before any antibiotic treatment.

Dental care should be carried out every 6 months, with scaling and a search for infectious sites. Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in cases of dental extraction, periodontal surgery, dental procedures involving manipulation of the apical or gingival region, and any perforation of the oral mucosa.

The antibiotic of choice is Amoxicillin (2g in adults, 50mg/kg in children) 1 hour before the procedure. In the event of allergy, Clindamycin is used (600mg in adults, 20mg/kg in children).",1.0,16.220000000000006,False,True,0.8019008040428162,0.0,a,True,5,2

**Urinary tract infection** is one of the most common bacterial infections in children.

- Favored by: immaturity with abnormal bladder emptying (constipation plays a role) and bacterial reservoir (prepuce in young boys).
- In the first few months of life, urinary tract infections are more common in boys (up to 20% of infants under 3 months with an isolated fever) than in girls.
- Often associated with RVU (functional or malformative).",0.0,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.7828031182289124,0.0,a,False,1,1

**Title:** Knowing the Main Classes of Oral Antidiabetic Treatments

**Description:** None

The therapeutic strategy for non-insulin-dependent diabetes (mainly type 2 diabetes) is evolving rapidly, and HAS proposals are pending at the time of writing (December 2021).

The following classes of anti-diabetic treatments are currently available in France:

- **Biguanides:** Only representative, metformin. Active on the liver, reduces hepatic glucose production, particularly hepatic gluconeogenesis (uncertain effect on the intestine). Frequent digestive side effects. Short half-life, unchanged renal elimination, therefore accumulates in renal failure: need to reduce doses, and formal contraindication for a GFR <30 ml/min. Contraindicated in situations with spontaneous risk of lactic acidosis.

- **Hypoglycaemic Sulphonamides (Sulphonylureas):** Several representatives (gliclazide, glimepiride, etc.). They are associated with glinides (repaglinide) which have the same mechanism of action. Trigger insulin secretion, so inactive in the absence of pancreatic beta cells. Major risks: hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Metabolism and pharmacokinetics vary depending on the molecule and therefore require variable adjustment of dosage to renal function for hypoglycaemic sulphonamides. No contraindication for glinides even for end-stage renal failure.

- **Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 Inhibitors (DPP4, ""Gliptins""):** Several representatives (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, etc.). By inhibiting DPP4, they modestly increase circulating concentrations of incretins (GLP1 and GIP) and therefore increase insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion. No effect on weight, no effect on gastric emptying. Rare adverse effects (bullous pemphigoid). Posology to be adjusted to renal function. Modest therapeutic effect. No hypoglycaemia.

- **GLP1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1 Agonists):** Several representatives (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide). Injection. Have the same action as the natural hormone GLP1: amplify insulin secretion, slow down glucagon secretion. Early satiety, slower gastric emptying. Digestive side effects, start with increasing dosage. Weight loss, no hypoglycaemia. Variable pharmacology, all injectable, daily or weekly. Beneficial effect on cardiovascular prognosis.

- **Intestinal Alphaglucosidase Inhibitor:** Only representative: acarbose. It slows the end of digestion of complex carbohydrates, delays their intestinal absorption. Frequent digestive side effects. No effect on weight. Modest therapeutic effect.

- **SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Several types (dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, etc.). Inhibit glucose reabsorption by the proximal convoluted tubule, thus induce glucosuria and natriuresis. Beneficial effect on heart failure and chronic kidney disease, including in non-diabetic subjects. Weight loss, reduction in blood pressure. Adverse effects: risk of genital infection, dehydration, ketoacidosis, uncertainty about an increased risk of amputation. Can be prescribed up to a GFR of 25 ml/min.",0.16666666666666666,13.98769230769231,False,True,0.7974027395248413,0.0,a,True,4,1

The main symptom reported is chronic abdominal pain, spasm-like, most often localized in the left iliac fossa or hypogastrium (but may be present over the entire colonic frame). It is usually not present at night and may be exacerbated by eating. The pain is intermittent and occurs in fits and starts. It is often aggravated by episodes of stress or anxiety and subsides during periods of rest, such as holidays. The pain is linked to transit, with improvement or worsening after defecation.

Abdominal bloating and a subjective feeling of fullness or abdominal discomfort are very often associated.

The second key symptom of the disease is transit disorders. This may be constipation, clinically defined as fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, hard stools, or difficulty in evacuating. There may be diarrhea, defined as frequent stools, i.e., at least 3 a day (often postprandial, soft to liquid). These bowel movements may be urgent, and some patients develop toilet-seeking syndrome (locating available toilets in anticipation of a journey), or alternating diarrhea and constipation.

IBS is often associated with other functional symptoms. These include functional dyspepsia with the presence of upper gastrointestinal symptoms (early satiety, pyrosis, epigastric heaviness), fibromyalgia (diffuse myalgias and arthralgias with no organic substrate), and chronic fatigue syndrome.",0.6666666666666666,10.73,False,True,0.7776252031326294,0.0,a,False,2,4

Communicable infectious disease surveillance involves the compilation and analysis of clinical and/or microbiological data relating to infectious diseases. Its aim is to describe a disease and study its risk factors, with a view to implementing and evaluating prevention and control measures. Data may be collected on an ongoing or ad hoc basis, for example from laboratory networks, hospitals, or general practitioners.

**Monitoring can be:**

- **Passive:** Spontaneous reporting by field workers.
- **Active:** Data collection by dedicated staff who gather information that is often more exhaustive and elaborate than in the case of passive surveillance.
- **Semi-active:** Reminders sent to field workers, search for additional cases.

**Title:** Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome

**Description:** Attention, perceptual integrative functions, memory, and executive functions

There are four main sets of cognitive functions. Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).

**Definitions**

**Attention**

- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between ""Attention Disorder (SDD-129),"" ""Mental Confusion/Disorientation (SD-119)"" (which result from severe ""Attention Disorder (SDD-129)""), and ""Coma and Consciousness Disorder (SDD-028).""

- Attention is necessary for all major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.

- Tests include repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, and giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.

**Perceptual Integration Functions**

- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition, and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects, and the body schema.

- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe) and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.

- **Temporal Lobe Involvement:**

  - Aphasia (""Language and/or phonation disorders (SD-134)"") by impairment of comprehension, visual agnosia (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects like colors or shapes or more complex ones like faces, manufactured or living objects).

  - Tests understanding of simple commands (""close your eyes""), naming of objects or faces.

- **Parietal Lobe Involvement:**

  - Apraxia (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), visual neglect unilateral, i.e., inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), disturbance of the representation of the body schema (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc.).

  - Tested by copying a geometric figure, drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures (""military salute"", ""nose-thumbing""), and gestures involving the use of objects (""brushing teeth"", ""combing hair"", ""playing the violin"", ""hammering a nail"").

**Memory**

- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.), but in the tests, episodic memory is mainly assessed.

- **Episodic Memory:**

  - The ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e., the place, the moment, the emotional state).

  - The critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or ""consolidation"").

  - Depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the hippocampi and adjacent cortices.

  - Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to ""progressive forgetting"" (""What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?"").

- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.

  - 1. Read five words (""Museum"", ""Lemonade"", ""Colander"", ""Grasshopper"", and ""Truck"") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word (""What is the drink?""...).

  - 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).

  - 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g., a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.

**Executive Functions**

- Mental operations enabling the individual to understand the context of the action, to inhibit automatic or reflexive behavior, and to generate voluntary behavior directed towards a goal.

- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.

- Dysexecutive syndrome leads to a lack of contextualization (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgment and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviors (repetitive and stereotyped obsessive disorders, compulsive behavior) and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).

- Tested using the rapid frontal efficiency battery (BREF).",1.0,8.89777777777778,False,True,0.7346418499946594,0.0,c,False,1,3

The risk of respiratory complications and mortality is increased in pregnant women in the event of influenza.

**Definitions**

**Primary Prevention**

Flu vaccination is the best way for pregnant women to protect themselves. Only inactivated influenza vaccines can be used in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy. Transplacental passage of maternal influenza antibodies confers protection on newborns and infants who cannot be vaccinated before the age of 6 months.

Hygiene measures (wearing masks, using hydroalcoholic solutions, limiting visits) to reduce transmission have proved effective. It is important to limit contact with other people, especially those at risk.

**Hygiene Measures**

- Cover your mouth whenever you cough (mask).
- Cover your nose every time you sneeze.
- Blow your nose into single-use tissues disposed of in a lidded bin, then wash your hands with SHA.
- Spit only into a single-use paper handkerchief disposed of in a lidded bin, then use SHA.
- Wash your hands after each of these actions and regularly throughout the day.

**Secondary Prevention**

**Situation**  
- Influenza in pregnant women: Yes, if signs of severity.  
  - Treatment: Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) 75 mg: 2/d for 5 days ± paracetamol ± amoxicillin 3 g/d for 7 days.  
  - Hospitalization: No, unless signs of severity.  
  - Additional droplet precautions: 7 days (reference LG/ULI/051).  

- Contact < 48 hours with a pregnant woman with a possible case of influenza in the family: No in the absence of symptoms.  
  - Prophylactic treatment with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) 75 mg: 1/d for 10 days.  
  - Hospitalization: No.  

- A close relative of a pregnant woman has had contact with a possible case of influenza: No.  
  - Treatment: No.  
  - Hospitalization: No.  

**Clinical Signs of a Possible Case of Influenza (Epidemic Period):**  
- General signs: fever > 38°C or aches and pains or asthenia.  
- Respiratory signs: cough or dyspnoea.  

**Surroundings:** People living in the same dwelling or in close contact with it (< 1 m).

**Signs of Seriousness:**  
- Impairment of higher functions (confusion, impaired alertness, disorientation).  
- Respiratory rate > 30/min.  
- PAS < 90 mmHg.  
- HR > 120/min.

A nasal swab is taken for virological testing if there are any signs of seriousness or co-morbidities.

Curative antiviral treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) is started as soon as possible, and at the latest within 48 hours of the first signs, regardless of the trimester of pregnancy and whether or not there are any serious risk factors, without waiting for the results of the biological diagnosis.

Treatment is stopped if the virological test is negative (RT-PCR).

**Description:** Interrogatory and Clinical Examination  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Author:** CFEU: Proofreading  

== Definitions ==  

The diagnostic approach to micturition disorders begins with a careful clinical history, followed by a clinical examination. One or more long-term consultations are often necessary. Questioning of the parents and the child should look for:

- Signs of urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly, such as pollakiuria, urgency, daytime leaks when not urinating, and/or nocturnal leaks, with the date of onset of the problems and any notion of urinary infection.
- How and at what age the child learned to be toilet trained.
- The child's psychomotor and statural development, living habits, daily water intake, schooling, and leisure activities.
- Any use of protection and the psychosocial impact of bladder weakness.
- Any history of functional problems in the parents or siblings.
- Notions of malformative uropathy.
- Abdominal pain and anorectal problems.
- The existence of psychiatric disorders (e.g., ADHD), developmental disorders, sleep and obstructive disorders, and the family context in which the child is growing up.

== Differential Diagnoses ==  

This will enable us to rule out the main differential diagnoses, namely:

- In girls, vaginal micturition, which manifests as urine leakage often after micturition, without micturition problems. Vaginal micturition is associated with an inappropriate micturition position.
- Isolated urinary incontinence with laughter.
- Stress incontinence: urinary leakage during physical exercise or when coughing or sneezing.

== Clinical Examination ==  

The clinical examination begins with an inspection of the underwear for signs of urine leakage or soiling, followed by a search for a bladder globe. The following tests should be carried out:

- Examination of the external genitalia, including the appearance of the penis, any abnormality of the vulva, and irritation of the genitals and vulva.
- Observation of urination, if possible, is informative.
- Abdominal palpation to look for stercoral congestion and a bladder globe.
- Complete neurological examination, assessing motor skills of the lower limbs and perineal sensitivity, and searching for skin stigmata in the lumbosacral region, sometimes discreet, in favor of a spinal dysraphism.
- Neuro-orthopaedic examination, including assessment for hollow foot, unequal length of lower limbs, scoliosis, and trophic disorders in favor of an associated neurological pathology.

A 48-hour voiding diary is a simple and highly informative tool, which complements the interview and enables pollakiuria to be confirmed and quantified, and the severity of urinary incontinence to be assessed. Its purpose is to record the frequency of micturition, the volume urinated (in ml), and the existence of urine leakage. It is very useful for characterizing the bladder-sphincter behavior of children, differentiating pollakiuria from polyuria, and assessing the extent of urine leakage.",0.25,12.3,False,True,0.8576470613479614,0.0,d,True,2,3

**Rubric:** Management

# Drugs Affecting the Renin-Angiotensin System: Mechanisms of Action, Indications, Side-Effects, Drug Interactions, Monitoring Procedures, and Main Causes of Failure

## Renin-Angiotensin System Drugs

### Two Classes of Drugs

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, INN ""-pril"" or ""-prilate"".
- Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, INN ""-sartan"".

## Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and the increase in concentrations of bradykinin. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists act as competitive inhibitors of angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors.

## Indications

### Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors

- All: Hypertension
- Most: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction
- Some: Proteinuric glomerular nephropathy
- Some: Recent post-myocardial infarction
- Ramipril: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with risk factors

### Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists

- All: Arterial hypertension
- Candesartan, losartan, and valsartan: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction in cases of contraindication or intolerance to ACE inhibitors.
- Irbesartan, losartan: Proteinuric diabetic nephropathy with hypertension
- Valsartan: Recent post-myocardial infarction
- Telmisartan: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with target organ damage

## Adverse Reactions

### Common

- Orthostatic or non-orthostatic hypotension, frequent, take care when taking for the first time.
- Hyperkalaemia, rare, most often in cases of renal failure.
- Acute renal failure, rare, reversible
- Angioneurotic oedema, rare, more frequent with ACE inhibitors (0.1 to 0.5%)
- Foetotoxicity, very serious, exceptional (pregnancy absolute contraindication)

### Specific to ACE Inhibitors

- Dry cough, frequent (5-20% on ACE inhibitors), stops after treatment is stopped

## Drug Interactions

- Potassium salts: Combination not recommended, risk of hyperkalaemia.
- Potassium-sparing diuretics: Risk of hyperkalaemia, combination not recommended except for spironolactone and eplerenone in heart failure. In the latter case, combination under strict control of kalaemia and renal function.
- Lithium: Combination not recommended, risk of increased lithaemia due to increased proximal tubular reabsorption.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: Combination not recommended, increased risk of renal failure and hyperkalaemia.
- Loop diuretics and thiazides: Caution in use, risk of arterial hypotension and/or acute renal failure in the event of hydrosodic depletion.

## Contraindications

- Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Absolute contraindication for both classes.
- Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- Angioneurotic oedema with ACE inhibitors.
- Renal insufficiency is not a contraindication, but requires precautions (monitoring of blood pressure, glomerular function, and kalaemia).

## Monitoring Procedures

- In the event of activation of the renin-angiotensin system, there is a significant risk of severe arterial hypotension, necessitating correction of associated factors and prescription of moderate, progressive doses, under clinical (blood pressure) and biological (kalaemia, creatininaemia) supervision. Classic situations include heart failure, intensive treatment with diuretics, severe de-sodorisation, hypovolaemia, diarrhoea, or vomiting.
- In patients whose renal function depends mainly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is a risk of severe arterial hypotension and acute renal failure. Classic situations include severe congestive heart failure, underlying renal damage, or rare bilateral renal artery stenosis.
- Most of these drugs are eliminated predominantly by renal excretion. Consequently, in cases of renal insufficiency, dosage should be adapted to glomerular function and biological monitoring (kalaemia, creatininaemia) should be closely monitored.
- Anaesthesia: Interruption of treatment is recommended the day before the operation due to the increased risk of arterial hypotension.
- Injection of iodinated contrast products increases the risk of acute renal failure, and it is advisable to interrupt treatment 24 hours beforehand.",0.6666666666666666,10.356923076923078,False,True,0.7838194370269775,0.0,a,False,4,3

**Title:** Knowing the major epidemiological trends in allergies to hymenoptera venoms: prevalence, mortality, etc.

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Epidemiology

**Definitions:**

Hymenoptera venoms (bees, wasps, hornets) contain:

- Vasoactive substances responsible for toxic reactions and non-allergic hypersensitivity.
- Enzymes and other proteins responsible for immediate immuno-allergic reactions mediated by venom allergen-specific IgE antibodies.

Bee stings occur mainly in spring and early summer, generally when the insect feels threatened. The sting remains in the skin, causing the bee's abdomen to rupture. The main allergen in the venom is phospholipase A2.

Wasps are more aggressive than bees and can sting for no apparent reason, sometimes several times because the sting does not stay in the skin. They sting until late autumn. Hyaluronidase, antigen 5, and phospholipase A1 are the three major allergens in the venom.

Hornets belong to the same family as wasps. Their stings are more painful, and the quantity of venom injected is greater. Allergic reactions are often crossed with wasp venom allergy (similar composition) and sometimes with bee venom (50% homology between phospholipase A2 from hornet venom and phospholipase A2 from bee venom).

**Prevalence of Hymenoptera Allergy:**

**Definitions**

Human beings are fallible, and it is in their nature to make mistakes. Acknowledging that we can make mistakes is a prerequisite for adopting error-prevention behavior. Recognizing that we have made a mistake is an opportunity to learn and progress. This is true for individuals and organizations. When an organization implements systems for identifying, analyzing, and preventing errors, it is referred to as a ""learning organization.""

An error of omission occurs when a necessary action has not been taken. An error by commission refers to an action that was carried out but was not useful. An error of execution refers to an action that was poorly carried out.

A violation (or non-compliance) occurs when a recommendation or professional rule is not respected. This non-compliance may be routine (a bad habit), the result of personal prioritization (to save time, for example), or induced by the context (over-activity, urgency, etc.).

Errors in care may relate to preventive, diagnostic, or treatment actions. They may or may not have resulted in harm to the patient. They are unintentional and avoidable. A serious adverse event (SAE) occurs when the harm is a death, a serious complication, or, at the very least, a one-day stay in the hospital.

**Types of Error**

- **Omission:** Occurs when a necessary action has not been taken.
- **Commission:** Refers to an action that was carried out but was not useful.

- **Stool Culture:** To be prescribed in cases of acute febrile diarrhoea, particularly in the case of TIAC, signs of seriousness, return from the tropics, and in immunocompromised patients. It should be done in the first few days of the illness, before any antibiotic therapy, if possible. Rectal swabs may be useful in infants.

- **Parasitological Examination of Stools:** To be prescribed after a stay in an endemic area, in immunocompromised patients (to look for cryptomicro- or isosporidia), or in cases of persistent diarrhoea as a second-line treatment. A fresh stool sample should be taken 3 times, spaced a few days apart to increase sensitivity, and sent to the laboratory in less than 2 hours. A negative result does not rule out the diagnosis.

- **C. difficile Toxin Testing:** Should be requested in adults in the event of diarrhoea following hospitalisation (nosocomial) and/or post-antibiotic treatment. C. difficile diarrhoea is rare in children and virtually non-existent before the age of 4, due to the absence of a toxin receptor. However, children are readily colonised by C. difficile, including toxin-secreting organisms, so there is no need to test for C. difficile in young children.

- **Blood Cultures:** Recommended if febrile diarrhoea is present.

**Rubric:** Pathophysiological elements

Like the vast majority of neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by an accumulation of proteins (known as proteinopathy) associated with cell loss. In the case of AD, this includes:

- The accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ-42) in extracellular deposits forming ""amyloid plaques"" or ""senile plaques."" A peptide is a protein fragment; in this case, the parent protein is Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). The plaques are mainly present in the associative cerebral cortices (prefrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices) and relatively spare the primary visual cortex (occipital lobes) and the motor cortex (precentral gyrus).

- Abnormal accumulation in the body and neuronal extensions of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein forming neurofibrillary degeneration (NFD); these NFDs are found in large quantities in the medial temporal regions, particularly the hippocampi.

**Title:** Know the Principles of Treating Hyponatremia According to the Severity of Symptoms

**Description:** Evaluate the degree of urgency according to the clinical symptoms, know the principles of water restriction, and correction rules (rhythm and strategy of possible osmolar supplements).

**Rubric:** Management

**Treatment of Hyponatremia:**

- Includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
- The amount of excess water is estimated using the formula: Excess Water = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).

**In Chronic Hyponatremia, Priority Should Be Given to:**

- Etiological treatment (e.g., discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH).
- Fluid restriction (500 mL/day) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
- Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector:
  - In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
  - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatremia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
    - Adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
    - If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/day orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.
    - In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles (""tea and toast"" syndrome), water restriction and/or increased osmole intake (animal proteins, NaCl) are generally sufficient.
  - In cases of associated extracellular hyperhydration: sodium restriction and loop diuretics.

**Rate of Correction:**

- The rate of correction of hyponatremia must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).

**In Emergency Cases of Severe Hyponatremia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O):**

- Whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:
  - Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.
  - NaCl 9 ‰ (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natremia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e., ≤ 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.
  - Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.
  - In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.
  - Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natremia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).",1.0,13.860000000000003,False,True,0.7742173075675964,0.0,d,False,2,3

Ectopic Pregnancy (Item 25 - ectopic pregnancy)

**Symptomatic Ectopic Pregnancy (EP)**  
Presence of any one of these severity criteria indicates a surgical emergency: haemodynamic instability, abdominal defense, or haemoperitoneum on ultrasound.

**Surgical Treatment:**

- As a matter of urgency
- After conditioning of the patient, preoperative work-up, grouping, and RAI call from the anesthetist

In the absence of these three criteria, surgery is indicated in patients with algism and/or a β-hCG level greater than 5,000 IU/L.

Diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis, specifies the location of the EP, and may identify risk factors (adhesions, sequelae of HGI). Conservative treatment options include salpingotomy or removal of the tube (salpingectomy).

**Pauci or Asymptomatic Ectopic Pregnancy (EP)**

In this case, treatment with methotrexate can be discussed with the patient: an intramuscular dose of 1 mg/m² in the absence of contraindications on the biological work-up (CBC, PT/ACT, renal and hepatic work-up).

Monitoring includes questioning about clinical symptoms and weekly monitoring of plasma β-hCG levels. A clinical examination and ultrasound scan may be carried out at any time in the event of functional signs suggesting a haemorrhagic complication of the EP. A second injection of methotrexate should be considered if the decrease in the plasma β-hCG level at day 7 is not satisfactory compared with the initial level (in practice, the β-hCG level at day 7 should be strictly lower than the level at day 0 or strictly lower than 85% of the β-hCG level at day 4 if this is available). Cure corresponds to an undetectable plasma β-hCG level, generally achieved after one month.

**Special Cases:**  
In certain exceptional cases, if the patient is asymptomatic, if the initial β-hCG level is less than 1,000 IU/L, and if the kinetics of β-hCG show a progressive and constant decrease, it may be possible to discuss abstention from treatment subject to good compliance by the patient (β-hCG measurement every 48 hours and clinical and ultrasound monitoring once a week).

**Meningioma:**

- Often benign, WHO grade 1
- Develops from arachnoid cells
- Predominantly affects females
- Peak incidence: 50-70 years
- Favoured by certain progestogens (e.g., cyproterone acetate)
- Possibility of multiple localisations (meningiomatosis), associated with other tumour varieties (e.g., schwannomas) in neurofibromatosis type 2
- MRI: extra-parenchymal tumour; well-circumscribed; dural thickening (""comet tail"" sign); homogeneous enhancement post-contrast (gadolinium)
- Treatment: primarily surgical for symptomatic or progressing cases

**Pituitary Adenoma:**

- Can be secreting (prolactinoma, GH, LH, FSH, ACTH, TSH adenomas) or non-secreting
- Clinical signs:
  - Endocrine syndrome: hypersecretion or insufficiency of hormonal sectors
  - Mass syndrome: e.g., optic chiasm compression (bitemporal hemianopia)
  - Pituitary apoplexy (rarer)
- First-line treatment: surgery, except prolactinoma (treated with dopaminergic agonists). Correction of endocrine deficits is crucial.

**Low-Grade and High-Grade Glioma (Glioblastoma):**

- Develops from glial cells:
  - Astrocyte → astrocytoma
  - Oligodendrocyte → oligodendroglioma
- WHO classification grades:
  - Grade 1: benign
  - Grade 2: low-grade malignancy (progresses to grades 3 and 4)
  - Grades 3 and 4: high-grade malignancy
- Glioblastoma subtypes:
  - Primary (de novo)
  - Secondary: transformation of low-grade glioma; affects younger subjects
- Prognostic factors for glioblastoma (grade 4):
  - Age < 70
  - Preserved general and neurological condition (Karnofsky index > 70%)
  - Quality of surgical resection
- Molecular biology: IDH mutation (secondary glioblastoma); MGMT gene promoter methylation predicts chemotherapy sensitivity

**Gliomas:**

- **Low Grade:**
  - Grade 1: < 20 years, infra-tentorial, mixed cystic/solid, enhancement post-contrast, surgery can lead to healing if complete resection
  - Grade 2: 20-40 years, supra-tentorial, T2 hypersignal, T1 hyposignal, no contrast enhancement, surgery (maximal resection if possible), +/- radiotherapy/chemotherapy, inevitable progression to anaplasia (grades 3 and 4)

A clinico-biological examination is carried out prior to MAP to investigate and identify the causes of the couple's infertility. It is also used to assess the benefit-risk balance of MAP treatment for the individuals concerned.

It includes, as a minimum, the following examinations, following a medical history to look for specific risk factors:

- Clinical examination of both members of the couple if necessary
- Examination of the cycle and ovarian status
- Uterine and/or uterotubal examination as appropriate
- Spermogram, spermocytogram, sperm culture, and sperm survival migration test if appropriate
- Testicular ultrasound and even sperm excretory tract ultrasound if necessary, in the event of alterations in sperm parameters
- Health safety tests on both members of the couple or on the unmarried woman

For a detailed exploration of infertility, refer to the LISA sheet for item 38 (Couple's infertility, what to do at the first consultation).

""Health security tests"" include HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis serologies for both members of the couple or the unmarried woman. For people vaccinated against hepatitis B, a serological check is not necessary if immunity is known and documented.

The sperm survival migration test is indicated prior to MPA, in order to choose the most appropriate MPA technique. This test selects the most mobile spermatozoa and induces sperm capacitation. The result is an estimated number of progressively mobile spermatozoa ""usable"" for MPA.

A psycho-social assessment, involving an interview with a psychologist, may be offered to all couples undergoing MAP. An interview with a psychiatrist or a psychologist attached to the team is recommended (and systematically offered) for couples or unmarried women having recourse to gamete or embryo donation.

**Title:** Know the indications, procedures for performing, analyzing, and interpreting blood cultures.  
**Description:** None  

**Indications:**  

Blood cultures must be taken if bacteremia or fungemia is suspected:  

- Fever (with or without chills) associated with one of the following criteria:  
  - Purpura febrile  
  - Need for hospitalization or fever occurring during hospitalization  
  - Special circumstances (asplenia, neutropenia, presence of a vascular catheter)  
  - Hypothermia with or without signs of organ failure (see Sepsis and septic shock)  
  - Hypotension, tachycardia associated with signs of poor peripheral perfusion (mottling, cold extremities, prolonged skin recoloration time)  

- Suspicion of endocarditis: Perform three pairs of blood cultures, even in the absence of fever  

- If fungemia is suspected (catheter, febrile immunosuppressed patient on antibiotics, digestive surgery, etc.), blood cultures on fungal flasks are indicated, as these media inhibit bacterial growth, which prevents yeasts from growing.  

Blood cultures do not need to be taken at the time of a fever peak or when shivering.  

**How Blood Cultures Are Taken:**  

- Compliance with asepsis rules: hand hygiene, careful skin antisepsis of the puncture area (using an alcoholic antiseptic solution), wearing gloves, etc.  
- Puncture of a peripheral vein  
- If the patient has a central catheter: concomitant blood cultures on the catheter  
- Inoculation of at least 2 bottles (1 pair): aerobic then anaerobic  
- If signs of severity: collect 4 to 6 vials during a single puncture (do not delay antibiotic therapy)  
- In the absence of serious signs:  
  - 4 to 6 vials are taken with 10 ml/vial (approximately 1 CFU of bacteria/mL of blood): maximum sensitivity with 40-60 mL of blood, so the vials must be well filled  
  - To be taken at the same time or 30 minutes apart, except if endocarditis is suspected = spread over the first 24 hours  

- In children, if venipuncture is difficult (often the case in infants), it is preferable to fill a single blood culture bottle with a large quantity of blood rather than multiplying the bottles with a small quantity of blood  
- Samples should be taken before any antibiotic therapy, except in cases of purpura fulminans  

**Analysis of Blood Cultures in the Laboratory:**  

- After transfer to the microbiology laboratory, the vials are introduced into the automated system for monitoring (detection of bacterial/fungal growth)  
- If culture positive (within 24-48 hours for most bacteria): direct examination (Gram stain) and clinician informed  
- Then carry out the antibiotic susceptibility test (requires a further 24 hours)  
- Inform the microbiologist of suspected endocarditis: incubation period 10 to 14 days  
- Inform the microbiologist/mycologist of immunosuppressive factors requiring cryptococcosis testing (incubation period 3 to 4 weeks)  
- Fungal blood cultures: positive in 1 to 5 days (confirmation of the presence of yeasts or filaments by MGG or Giemsa staining). Immediate communication to the clinician to start probabilistic antifungal treatment  
- Fungal subcultures for identification and antifungal gram: minimum delay 3 days  
- Techniques for more rapid identification of the microorganism exist (PCR, mass spectrometry) but are not available in all laboratories  

**Interpretation of a Positive Fungal Blood Culture:**  

- Any flask positive for ""Candida"" spp or ""Cryptococcus neoformans"" should be taken into consideration and treated  
- The detection of rare yeasts should be discussed with the mycologist  
- Malassezia yeasts are responsible for fungemia in neonatology  

**Interpretation of Blood Cultures: Contamination During Puncture or ""True"" Bacteremia?**  

Take into account the number of positive vials and the microbial species:  

- Infectious agents that are always pathogenic (always a true bacteremia): Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pyogenic streptococci, Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria, Brucella, Pasteurella, and Candida  
- Possible contaminants (because they belong to the skin flora):  
  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp., and Bacillus spp.  
  - To conclude that bacteremia has been caused by these bacteria, the following is required:  
    - A compatible context (catheter or endovascular equipment in place)  
    - At least 2 positive blood culture bottles from 2 different pairs with the same bacterial species presenting the same antibiotic sensitivity phenotype (same antibiogram)  ",1.0,13.945882352941176,False,True,0.8705484867095947,0.0,a,False,2,3

**Title:** Social Protection: Definition and Operating Principles

**Description:** Understanding the definition of social protection, social risks, and the four logics of social protection: social insurance, social assistance, universal protection, and individual or collective providence.

**Rubric:** Definition

**Social Protection** refers to all the protection mechanisms granted by a society to its members to enable them to cope with the social risks of life and their financial consequences.

Social risks are situations likely to compromise the financial security of an individual or their family by causing a fall in resources or an increase in expenditure (e.g., old age, illness, unemployment, family responsibilities).

**Four Approaches to Social Protection Coexist:**

- **Compulsory Social Insurance Approach:** Aims to protect insured persons against loss of income due to social risks. Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries.

- **Social Assistance Logic:** Allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (e.g., minimum social benefits such as the revenu de solidarité active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicapé [AAH], or the fonds de solidarité vieillesse [FSV]).

- **Logic of Universal Protection:** Covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits).

- **Individual Protection Logic:** Based on savings (e.g., the decision to buy dental implants) and private insurance, while collective protection is based on the pooling of risks.",1.0,6.705000000000002,False,True,0.7596563696861267,0.0,a,True,3,2

# Diuretics

## Three Drug Classes

The image shows various types of diuretics.

- Loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide)
- Thiazide diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide)
- Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., amiloride, spironolactone)

## Mechanisms of Action

### Loop Diuretics

- Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NKCC2 co-transporter (""Na-K-Cl cotransporter"") at the level of the large ascending branch of Henlé.
- Associated effects: renal loss of calcium and magnesium, renal loss of potassium, and metabolic alkalosis.

### Thiazide Diuretics

- Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NCC transporter in the distal convoluted tubule.
- Associated effects: altered dilution capacity, renal potassium loss, reduced urinary calcium excretion.

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Two mechanisms of action depending on the molecule:

- Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (eNaC) (amiloride)
- Aldosterone receptor antagonist (spironolactone)
- Associated effects: potassium sparing, metabolic acidosis

## Indications

### Loop Diuretics

- Edema of cardiac, renal (in particular nephrotic syndrome), or hepatic origin (usually in association with a potassium-sparing diuretic).
- Heart failure
- Arterial hypertension (SD-042) in patients with chronic renal failure when thiazide diuretics are contraindicated (particularly when creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min).

### Thiazide Diuretics

- High blood pressure
- Edema of cardiac, renal, or hepatic origin (usually in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic).

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- eNaC inhibitor (amiloride): In association with thiazide or loop diuretics, to prevent potassium depletion; ascites and edema in cirrhotics.

### Aldosterone Receptor Antagonist

- Hyperaldosteronism secondary to diuretic treatment or edema.
- Essential arterial hypertension and resistant arterial hypertension (after use of a validated triple antihypertensive therapy at the right dose and hygiene and dietary measures).
- Stage III or IV heart failure, in association with a loop diuretic or a conversion enzyme inhibitor.
- Adjuvant therapy for myasthenia to reduce potassium requirements.

## Adverse Reactions

### Loop Diuretics and Thiazides

- Hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia, hyperuricaemia, volume depletion.
- Glucose intolerance, increased triglycerides
- Immuno-allergic reaction
- Tinnitus, deafness (loop diuretics)
- Hypercalcaemia (thiazide diuretics), hypomagnesaemia (loop diuretics)

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
- Gynecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularity, libido disorders (non-specific aldosterone receptor antagonists).
- Immuno-allergic reaction

## Drug Interactions

### With Loop and Thiazide Diuretics

- Drugs that prolong the QT interval (risk of torsade de pointes)
- Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blockers of the renin-angiotensin system: risk of acute renal failure.

### With Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hyperkalaemic drugs (ciclosporin, tacrolimus, renin-angiotensin system blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trimethoprim), particularly in diabetic patients and/or patients with heart failure, who are at greater risk of hyperkalaemia.
- Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin-angiotensin system blockers: risk of acute renal failure.

## Contraindications

### Loop Diuretics

- Hypersensitivity
- Urinary tract obstruction, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia
- Acute hepatitis, severe hepatocellular insufficiency (furosemide)
- Pregnancy and breastfeeding

### Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

- Hypersensitivity, hyperkalaemia, severe or acute renal failure, pregnancy, breastfeeding.

## Monitoring Procedures

- Clinical: weight, hydration status, blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, skin fold, etc.
- Biological: kalaemia, natraemia, creatininaemia, calcaemia in certain patients on thiazides, uric acid, etc.
- ECG if hypo- or hyperkalaemia

## Causes of Failure

- Refractory edema: severe hypoalbuminemia, heart failure, etc.

**Description:** Hip examination, hearing screening, vision screening  

## Examination of the Hips (Term Newborn Examination SD-039)

Congenital dislocation of the hips (CDH) affects 3 to 20 children per 1000 births, with 4 girls for every 1 boy. CDH results from an abnormality in the antenatal development of the hip, leading to instability of the joint or even dislocation at birth. The risk factors for CDH are:  
- Family history of 1st degree CDH  
- Breech presentation, regardless of the mode of delivery  
- Limitation of unilateral or bilateral hip abduction  
- Congenital asymmetric pelvis  
- Associated postural abnormalities (genu recurvatum, torticollis)  

Screening consists of a clinical examination at birth and at each consultation until walking age, looking for:  
- Asymmetry of the folds and lengths of the lower limbs  
- Abduction limitation <60°  
- Instability of the hip using the Barlow manoeuvre, which reveals a protrusion in the case of a ""dislocatable hip"" or ""reducible dislocated hip."" In the case of an irreducible dislocated hip, there is no protrusion, only a limitation of abduction with asymmetry  

If there are any abnormalities in the clinical examination or risk factors for CDH, an ultrasound scan of the hips is prescribed. After 4 months, the reference examination is a pelvic X-ray.

## Hearing Screening (Hearing Loss/Deafness)

5% of children under the age of 6 have a hearing defect. Congenital CMV infection is the leading cause of congenital deafness. Risk factors for congenital deafness are:  
- Family history  
- Birth before 32 weeks' gestation and/or birth weight <1800g  
- Perinatal asphyxia  
- Hyperbilirubinaemia >350 µmol/L  
- Neurological disorders  
- Malformation of the face and neck  
- Foetopathy (CMV, rubella, herpes, toxoplasmosis)  
- Ototoxic treatment  

Screening is carried out systematically in maternity wards using induced acoustic emission tests (EAPT). If the examination is abnormal on two occasions, the newborn is referred to an ENT specialist for a check-up. If abnormalities are confirmed on examination, an audiogram and auditory evoked potentials will be carried out in a specialist centre.

## Visual Screening

The risk factors for visual problems are:  
- Prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation  
- Neurological disorders  
- Deafness  
- Chromosomal anomalies (trisomy 21, etc.)  
- Craniostenosis, craniofacial dysostoses  
- Embryo-fetopathies (toxoplasmosis)  
- In utero exposure to cocaine, alcohol  
- Family history of hereditary ophthalmological disease (congenital cataract, congenital glaucoma, etc.)  

Screening is based on clinical examination:  
- Eyelids: ptosis, epicanthus, angioma  
- Eyeballs: microphthalmia, buphthalmia  
- Conjunctivae: redness, tearing  
- Corneas: symmetry of corneal reflections, corneal opacity  
- Pupils: leukocoria (retinoblastoma, cataract), anisocoria (neuroblastoma)  
- Iris  

The examination assesses ocular pursuit with a target and looks for the presence of nystagmus. Intermittent and alternating strabismus may indicate delayed acquisition of oculomotricity up to the age of 3 months. Permanent or divergent strabismus, whatever the age, or present after the age of 3 months, should be considered pathological (Child Strabismus SD-157).",0.3333333333333333,14.414782608695656,False,True,0.640363335609436,0.0,a,False,1,1

**Title:** Know the positive clinical and/or biological elements that allow the diagnosis of menopause to be made.

**Description:** None

== Typical Form ==
In its typical form, the positive diagnosis is primarily clinical and is based on the association of:

- An amenorrhoea of at least 12 months
- Occurring around the age of 50
- Associated with climacteric symptoms (though climacteric symptoms may be absent).

In the typical form, there is no room for biological confirmation of the diagnosis.

The search for other diagnoses of amenorrhoea should be taken into account depending on the patient's age (necessary if under 40).

== Special Cases ==
In the case of hysterectomy, the diagnosis will be based on the conditions of the hysterectomy, the existence of climacteric symptoms, and/or the patient's age.

In the case of oestroprogestogenic contraception or amenorrhoea induced by certain contraceptives or hormonal treatments, the diagnosis of menopause can be difficult. Biological assays can be used (FSH > 30 IU/ml and estradiol < 10-20 pg/ml). However, these assays can be distorted by the use of hormonal contraception, and there is considerable variability in these assays during the perimenopausal phase.

The strategy proposed is most often to stop the treatment in progress and monitor the clinical situation (onset of amenorrhoea).",1.0,10.154545454545456,False,True,0.7910018563270569,0.0,b,True,4,2

Potassium is the main cation in intracellular fluids, where its concentration varies from 100 to 150 mEq/L. In a 70 kg man, potassium represents a stock of around 3,750 mmol, 98% of which is located in the intracellular compartment. The skeletal muscle cell constitutes the largest potassium reserve. For a 70 kg man, 28 kg of muscle cells correspond to 2,600 mmol of potassium.

Potassium is not very abundant in the extracellular compartment (less than 2% of total potassium) but its plasma concentration is very finely regulated. Normal plasma values are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L. Kalaemia is finely regulated by internal regulatory systems, linked to NaK-ATPase activity, and external systems (mainly kidneys, adrenals, liver, and digestive tract):

**Internal Systems Regulating Intracellular Potassium Transfer via NaK-ATPase Activity:**
- Catecholamines, which stimulate cellular uptake of K+ (β-adrenergic effect)
- Insulin, which stimulates cellular K+ entry
- Acid-base state: Metabolic acidosis blocks cellular K+ entry (inhibition of NaK-ATPase). It also increases the passive leakage of potassium into the extracellular sector.

**Title:** Knowing the indication for carrying out a multi-allergen IgE screening test (aeroallergens and trophallergens)

**Description:** None

The multiallergenic test is prescribed by the primary care physician. It is prescribed for patients when questioning points to a respiratory or food allergy, and when an allergist cannot be consulted for several months.

The aim is to detect IgE antibodies specific to a panel of allergens most commonly encountered in the immediate type of allergy.

**In case of suspected respiratory allergy:**

- Tests with mixtures of pneumallergens: Phadiatop®, Alatop®, Allergyscreen®.

**In the event of a suspected food allergy:**

- Tests with trophallergen mixtures: Trophatop® (children or adults, see ""paediatric specialities"" below)

It is not necessary to be fasting or to have stopped taking antihistamines before the sample is taken.

The answer is only qualitative (positive or negative).

**Warning:** A positive multi-allergen test does not mean allergy. If exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy (e.g., positive specific IgE to peanuts, even though the patient eats peanuts without any problem, means sensitisation and not allergy). This is important because it is not necessary to avoid the food in this case, or it may cause a long-term allergy to this food (break in tolerance).

Multi-allergenic tests can also detect atopy with very good sensitivity (>90%).",0.16666666666666666,12.172307692307694,False,True,0.8076094388961792,0.0,a,False,4,3

== Definitions ==

When a TDS is mentioned, differential diagnoses must be ruled out because the clinical symptoms are not very specific:

- Thyroid pathology: Hypothyroidism (243)
- A hypothalamic central involvement: Pituitary adenoma (244)
- Prolactin adenoma
- Iatrogenic hypogonadism (spironolactone, ketoconazole, flutamide, cyproterone, etc.)
- Hypogonadism secondary to another pathology (haemochromatosis, Cushing's disease, cirrhosis (279), pathological obesity (253), hypopituitarism (244), etc.)
- Natural ageing (123)

In the event of a confirmed diagnosis of TDS, initial treatment will be based on natural testosterone supplementation via the transdermal or intramuscular route. The management of all symptoms secondary to TDS must not be forgotten, including osteoporosis (123), brittle osteopathies (128), and metabolic syndrome (222).",0.0,16.63,False,True,0.8496429920196533,0.0,a,True,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the pathophysiology of hypersensitivity reactions: allergic and non-allergic  
**Description:** Added today  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**

Hypersensitivity: Objective, reproducible symptoms, initiated by exposure to a defined stimulus, at doses tolerated by healthy individuals.

A distinction is made between allergic hypersensitivities (proven immunological mechanism, specific to an allergen) and non-allergic hypersensitivities (pharmacological or via direct stimulation of innate immunity).

**Atopy**

Hereditary predisposition to produce IgE antibodies in response to low doses of allergens. Atopy is considered a risk factor for developing immediate hypersensitivity symptoms (asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic urticaria).

**Awareness**

A term classically used in atopy, defined by the presence of an immediate positive skin test to an allergen, without prejudging any clinical reaction of an allergic type. This means that the body has developed specific IgE antibodies to the allergen in question. It is possible to be sensitized without being allergic (no clinical symptoms). In this case, tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.) are more effective than IgE and protect against clinical allergy. The skin test will be positive, IgE will be present in the patient, but there will be no allergy symptoms.

**Allergy**

Hypersensitivity reaction caused by adaptive immunity mechanisms: mediated by antibodies (most often IgE) or cells (most often T lymphocytes). Allergy corresponds to an imbalance between sensitization and tolerance mechanisms (IgG4, allergen-specific regulatory T cells, etc.).

**Allergens**

Antigens that induce the synthesis of antibodies (most often IgE) or specific T lymphocytes, inducing an allergic hypersensitivity reaction.

- Pneumallergens: Airborne allergens that are inhaled (nose, bronchi) or come into contact with the eyes.
- Trophallergens: Food allergens involved in food allergy reactions.
- Occupational allergens: Allergens present in the workplace.

**Physiopathology of Allergic Hypersensitivities**

All allergic hypersensitivities have two phases:

- A phase of central sensitization in the lymph nodes, asymptomatic, which leads to the synthesis of antibodies (IgE in HS type 1, IgM or IgG in HS type 2 or 3) or the differentiation of allergen-specific T lymphocytes (HS type 4).
- Peripheral revelation phase (in tissues), symptomatic (clinical allergy) following new contact with the allergen.

**Types of Hypersensitivity**

1. **Type 1 Hypersensitivity or Immediate Hypersensitivity**
   - This is the most common allergic reaction (allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, allergic urticaria, anaphylactic shock, etc.).
   - It is mediated by IgE antibodies specific to one (or more) allergens.
   - After their synthesis (sensitization phase), IgE antibodies bind to receptors on the surface of mast cells and basophilic cells.
   - During the revelatory phase, the allergen binds to IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils, activating these cells and leading to:
     - The release of stored mediators (histamine, proteases).
     - The synthesis of other inflammatory mediators from arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, leukotrienes).
     - The production of chemokines, which attract and activate inflammatory cells, and cytokines, which perpetuate inflammation.
   - These different mediators induce bronchoconstriction, vasodilatation, extravasation, and edema, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of anaphylaxis.
   - Activation of the inflammatory cascade leads to the recruitment of immune cells to the site of the allergic reaction, which explains why symptoms persist even though allergenic contact has ceased.

2. **Type 2 Hypersensitivity or Antibody-Related Cytotoxicity Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize an ""allergen carried by a target cell"".
   - Activation of complement or immune cells (NK cells, phagocytes, etc.) then leads to destruction of the target cell.
   - Example: Drug-induced cytopenia.

3. **Type 3 Hypersensitivity or Immune Complex Reaction**
   - Reaction mediated mainly by IgG or IgM, which recognize a ""circulating allergen"".
   - Formation of circulating soluble antigen/antibody complexes (or ""circulating immune complexes"").
   - These complexes are deposited in tissues and cause lesions due to inflammation by activating the complement system and recruiting inflammatory cells.
   - Example: Hypersensitivity pneumonia, serum sickness.

4. **Type 4 Hypersensitivity or Delayed Hypersensitivity**
   - Reaction mediated by allergen-specific memory T lymphocytes (LT), differentiated during the sensitization phase. The memory T cells recognize the allergen during the revelation phase (new contact with the allergen) and trigger either a cytotoxic reaction (TCD8+ lymphocytes) or a granulomatous reaction (TCD4+ lymphocytes) 48-72 hours after this new contact.
   - For example: CD8+ LT in contact eczema and certain drug allergies, LTCD4+ in hypersensitivity pneumonia, epithelioid and giganto-cellular granuloma (e.g., pulmonary granulomatosis).",1.0,12.425714285714289,False,True,0.7157406806945801,0.0,c,False,1,2

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose a Mediastinal Anomaly  
**Description:** Tumor, emphysema, aortic widening, cardiomegaly  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions**  
The mediastinum is the anatomical region of the thorax between the two lungs. It is divided into three compartments, often defined on a profile X-ray:

- **Anterior Mediastinum:** Contains fatty tissue, the thymus, and ganglion chains.
- **Middle Mediastinum:** Contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.
- **Posterior Mediastinum:** Contains the descending thoracic aorta, esophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, and lymph node chains.

The segmentation of the mediastinum is illustrated on a profile chest radiograph, with the anterior mediastinum in blue, the middle mediastinum in green, and the posterior mediastinum in yellow.

**Mediastinal Abnormalities**  
Mediastinal abnormalities may correspond to:

- The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious, or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Examples include mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumor, paraspinal abscess, and bronchogenic cyst.
- An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure. Examples include aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, and cardiomegaly.
- An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure in the mediastinum. Examples include intra-thoracic thyroid goitre and hiatal hernia.

**Causes of Mediastinal Masses**  
The main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are:

- **Anterior Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), thymic tumors, germ cell tumors, thyroid gland, pleuropericardial cyst.
- **Middle Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), bronchogenic cysts, vascular dilations.
- **Posterior Mediastinum:** Adenopathies (including lymphomas), neurogenic tumors, esophageal tumors, hiatal hernia.

**Characteristics of Mediastinal Abnormalities on X-ray**  
On a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality is characterized by:

- A clear external boundary convex towards the lung
- Gently sloping into the mediastinum
- Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements
- Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum

The mediastinal contours are often distorted. On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, and the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava. On the left, the superior arch corresponds to the left subclavian artery, the middle arch to the aortic button and pulmonary artery, and the inferior arch to the left ventricle.

The left pulmonary hilum is always slightly higher than the right. Normal pulmonary hili are never convex.

**Cardiomegaly**  
A frequently encountered mediastinal anomaly is cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly is defined on a chest X-ray taken in the standing position by a cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5.

**Diagnostic Imaging**  
While chest X-rays can detect mediastinal abnormalities, thoracic CT is the examination of choice for pinpointing the location of the abnormality and characterizing the lesion. Mediastinal MRI may also be indicated in certain special cases.

**Examples of Mediastinal Abnormalities on Imaging**  
Examples of mediastinal abnormalities on chest radiograph, with CT images provided for illustration, include:

- Superior and middle mediastinal enlargement (""chimney"") on chest radiograph and anterior and middle mediastinal mass on chest CT. Example: Hodgkin's disease.
- Convex deformity of the left middle arch on chest X-ray and dilatation of the pulmonary artery on chest CT. Example: Pulmonary artery hypertension.
- Convex deformity of the right hilum and filling of the aortopulmonary window on chest X-ray, with adenomegalia of the right hilum and aortopulmonary window on coronal CT scan. Example: Mediastinal sarcoidosis.
- Rounded opacity with sharp contours in projection of the cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray, with posterior mediastinal mass with partial aero content on chest CT. Example: Hiatal hernia.",1.0,6.705000000000002,False,True,0.6896771788597107,0.0,b,False,5,1

## Definitions

Adjustment is a method of statistical analysis used to account for one or more confounding factors (a third factor linked to both the exposure being investigated and the occurrence of the health phenomenon being studied).

A measure of adjusted association is often the result of a multivariate analysis method (such as linear regression, logistic regression, or a Cox model) which makes it possible to identify the exposure factors studied that are independently linked to the phenomenon studied (judgment criterion), taking account of confounding factors (their effect is neutralized). This means identifying the impact of the exposure factors studied, all other things being equal.

Unadjusted measures of association are referred to as gross.

Example: The following table is taken from ""Prado et al, Lancet Oncol 2008, 9:629-35"" and presents crude (Univariate analysis) and adjusted (Multivariate analysis) hazard ratios measuring the association between the presence of sarcopenia (exposure factor studied) and survival (endpoint) in obese patients with respiratory or digestive cancer. The association between sarcopenia and survival in these patients was significant in univariate analysis, with a crude HR of 2.4 (IC95%=[1.5-3.9]). This association remained significant after adjustment for functional status, cancer location, and stage with an adjusted HR of 4.2 (CI95%=[2.4-7.2]).

**Definitions**

**Headache (SD-118):** Severe (VAS of 7 or more) and maximal in less than one minute.

**Brutal Headache:** Maximum in a few minutes. Causes of headaches that peak in less than an hour are similar to those of thunderclap headaches.

**1. Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) or Meningeal Haemorrhage (item 341)**

- SAH or meningeal haemorrhage: Cause of 10 to 25% of sudden headaches.
- Typical headache (SAH due to rupture of aneurysm): Explosive, thunderclap-like, severe, associated with other signs of meningeal syndrome and persistent cervicalgia.
- Sometimes an isolated, short-lived headache (meningeal epistaxis of low severity, preceding a massive SAH).
- Associated signs: Comitial seizures, focal deficit (if cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage), III paralysis (compression by an aneurysm of the posterior communicating artery or carotid termination), and/or consciousness disorder (transient or coma).

**2. Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)**

- RCVS: 10 to 45% of thunderclap headaches in emergency departments; under-diagnosed because of recent description (2007).
- SVCR: Segmental and diffuse vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries, reversible within 3 months. May be complicated by cortical SAH without aneurysm and stroke (item 340) (either cerebral haemorrhage or cerebral infarction).
- Typical headache: Thunderclap headache, lasting 5 minutes to several hours and recurring over 1 to 3 weeks, usually provoked by exertion, emotion, Valsalva, or sexual activity.
- Other associated signs: Hypertensive crisis, comitial seizures, and/or focal deficit.
- Evocative contexts: Postpartum, exposure to vasoactive substances (cannabis, cocaine, serotonergic antidepressants, sympathomimetics, nasal decongestants, or triptan) or stress.

**3. Rarer Causes of Sudden Headache**

The following sudden headaches have few specific characteristics and should be investigated after ruling out SAH and if the picture does not suggest CVRS.

- **Intracerebral Hemorrhage:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discreet (frontal or cerebellar hemorrhage) (see stroke item 340).
- **Ischaemic Stroke:** Headache sometimes isolated, with focal deficit absent or very discrete (especially in cerebellar infarction) (see stroke item 340).
- **Dissection of Cervical Arteries:** Acute headache with cervicalgia.
  - Carotid dissection: On the side of the dissection: Claude-Bernard Horner, pulsatile tinnitus, paralysis of XII, orbital pain.
  - Vertebral dissection: Posterior neck pain and cervicalgia.
  - Headache precedes signs of retinal or cerebral ischaemia (transient amaurosis, TIA, or stroke) (stroke item 340).
- **Cerebral Venous Thrombosis:** More often gives progressive headaches by JTIC, but sometimes brutal headaches (stroke item 340).
- **Pituitary Apoplexy or Necrosis:** Abrupt headache, visual disturbances, bitemporal hemianopsia, then signs of pituitary insufficiency, postpartum setting, sometimes complicates a pituitary adenoma (pituitary adenoma item 244).
- **Cardiovascular Causes:** (Myocardial ischaemia, aortic dissection) by projected pain: rare.
- **Acute HTIC:** Acute hydrocephalus on certain intracranial tumours (item 299) compressing the 3rd or 4th ventricle, transient brutal headache on movement or coughing, later becoming permanent.
- **Hypertensive Encephalopathy and Eclampsia:** Headache preceding the signs of encephalopathy (consciousness disorders ± focal deficits ± epilepsy) with hypertension.
- **Intracranial Hypotension:** Postural orthostatic headache that disappears with decubitus; most often revealed by a progressive headache.
- **Meningitis and Meningoencephalitis (item 151):** Headache with infectious syndrome; most often reveals itself as a progressive headache.
- **Giant Cell Arteritis (item 195):** To be considered in the presence of any recent and unusual headache in a subject > 50 years of age, including in the presence of a sudden headache after ruling out other causes.
- **Acute Blocked Sinusitis (item 148):** Headache that increases with the head bent forward, should be considered as a diagnosis of exclusion (after ruling out neurological causes of sudden headache).
- **Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma (item 84):** Violent retrobulbar or periorbital headache, light halos, decreased visual acuity, nausea and vomiting, red eye, and mydriatic pupil.",1.0,6.705000000000002,False,True,0.7045811414718628,0.0,b,True,5,2

**Title:** Knowing the pathophysiology of antierythrocyte alloimmunisation  
**Description:** Understand and explain foetomaternal alloimmunisation  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**Definitions**  
Anti-erythrocyte alloimmunisation corresponds to the presence in a pregnant woman of an irregular antibody, i.e., non-A, non-B, directed against a blood group antigen. There are risks for the foetus and/or newborn baby if it has the corresponding antigen. This is the leading cause of foetal anaemia.

The patient may become immune during pregnancy as a result of foetomaternal haemorrhage (passage of ""incompatible"" foetal red blood cells into the maternal circulation).

The most frequent and serious alloimmunisations with foetal and neonatal consequences are anti-D (Rh1), c (Rh4), or Kell. Other blood group antigens may be involved much more rarely and with a lower risk (anti-E).

This situation can lead to foetal anaemia in cases of foetal-maternal blood incompatibility. If the foetus has the erythrocyte antigen corresponding to the maternal antibody, the passage of maternal antibodies across the placenta may be responsible for haemolysis and therefore foetal anaemia. In the case of severe anaemia, this can lead to hydrops (effusion of foetal serosa) and foetal death.

**Definitions**

The photomotor reflex (PMR) is the pupillary constriction that occurs when one eye is illuminated.

- The afferent pathway of the PMR travels with the optic pathways: it begins at the retinal photoreceptors stimulated by light. The pupillomotor fibers travel along the optic nerves to the chiasma, where they undergo hemidecussation, and then along the optic bands to the external geniculate bodies. They do not follow the optic radiations but reach the two nuclei of the Ill.

- The parasympathetic efferent pathway of the PMR follows the Ill pathway and ends at the sphincter of the iris.

In a normal subject, when one eye is illuminated, there is a reflex myosis on the same side: this is the direct PMR. Due to the hemidecussation of the pupillomotor fibers at the chiasma, there is also myosis of the opposite eye via the contralateral Ill: this is the consensual PMR.

**Sensory Mydriasis Secondary to Severe Visual Impairment**  
(e.g., occlusion of the central retinal artery, optic neuropathy):

- When the affected eye is illuminated, the afferent pathway of the PMR is ""suppressed"" due to the drop in vision. The direct PMR is abolished, as is the consensual PMR.
- With illumination of the other eye, the afferent pathway is normal in this eye and the efferent pathway is normal in both eyes, so the PMR is preserved in both eyes.

**Paralytic Mydriasis**  
(Mydriasis caused by Ill's paralysis):

- With illumination of the affected eye, the afferent pathway of the PMR is preserved, so there is an abolition of the direct PMR (linked to paralysis of the iris sphincter), but the consensual PMR is preserved.
- Conversely, when the other eye is illuminated, the direct PMR is preserved, but the consensual PMR (PMR of the affected eye) is abolished.

A patient with a photomotor reflex disorder presents with Anisocoria (asymmetry of pupil size).

- When anisocoria is more marked in the dark, the pathological eye is the one with the tightest pupil (myosis).
- When anisocoria is more marked in the light, the pathological eye is the one with the largest pupil (mydriasis).",0.75,11.706666666666667,False,True,0.7856196761131287,0.0,d,False,2,1

Neonatal blood screening is systematically carried out on blotting paper at around 72 hours of life (not before 48 hours). Clear and comprehensible information must be given to the parents, and written consent is recorded before the blood sample is taken. Parents are only notified if there is an abnormal result requiring a follow-up test. This screening concerns six diseases:

- **Phenylketonuria**  
  - Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency → screening = increased phenylalanine dosage  
  - Neonatal warning signs: none  
  - Risk of psychomotor retardation in the absence of treatment (phenylalanine-controlled diet).

- **Congenital Hypothyroidism**  
  - L-Thyroxine secretion deficiency due to thyroid dysgenesis (athyreosis, hypoplasia, ectopia) or hormonogenesis disorder (thyroid gland in place) → screening: elevation of TSH blood level  
  - Neonatal warning signs: prolonged jaundice, constipation, hypotonia, sucking difficulties, wide fontanelles, hypothermia, macroglossia. Risk of psychomotor retardation, osteodystrophy, growth retardation in the absence of treatment (thyroid hormone replacement).

- **Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia**  
  - 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (>95% of cases), leading to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and excess androgen production → screening: elevation of 17-OH-progesterone blood levels  
  - Neonatal call signs: salt loss syndrome with vomiting, dehydration, and metabolic disorders (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia). In girls, virilisation of the external genitalia visible from birth.  
  - Treatment: hydrocortisone replacement, fludrocortisone, and sodium supplementation.

- **Cystic Fibrosis**  
  - Mutations in the CFTR gene encoding a transmembrane protein regulating chloride ion transport → screening: increased immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) blood levels.  
  - Neonatal signs: meconium ileus, retentional cholestatic jaundice.

- **Sickle Cell Disease**  
  - Structural abnormality of the β chain of globin leading to the production of abnormal haemoglobin S → screening: haemoglobin electrophoresis (specific HbS band and absence of HbA band). Screening targeted at children whose parents are from high-prevalence countries: sub-Saharan Africa, West Indies, French Guiana, Réunion, Mediterranean basin.

An adverse event related to healthcare is an unfavorable event for the patient as a result of diagnostic, treatment, prevention, or rehabilitation strategies and procedures.

Risks related to healthcare are regularly assessed, particularly through the national study of adverse events related to healthcare in healthcare establishments (ENEIS). The main results of this ENEIS study are as follows:

- 3 to 5% of medical and surgical admissions were due to a serious adverse event.
- Approximately 50% of serious adverse events leading to hospitalization were associated with healthcare products, half of which were avoidable.
- The observed incidence of serious adverse events during hospitalization in medicine or surgery is around 7%.
- 2 out of 5 serious adverse events occurring during hospitalization are considered to be avoidable.
- In 2 out of 5 cases, serious adverse events occurring during hospitalization lead to prolonged hospitalization.",0.5714285714285714,18.52714285714286,False,True,0.7712060809135437,0.0,c,False,2,2

**Diagnosis**

All glomerular syndromes are possible:

- Recurrent macroscopic haematuria syndrome, without clots or pain, typically 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection.
- Chronic glomerulonephritis syndrome.
- Isolated microscopic haematuria.
- Other possible presentations include:
  - Impure nephrotic syndrome with haematuria and hypertension.
  - Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome.

**Diagnosis of NIgA is based on renal biopsy:**

- Mesangial deposits of IgA and C3.
- Mesangial cell proliferation, ± endocapillary, ± extracapillary.

**Etiological Diagnosis**

- Associated secondary NIgA:
  - Cirrhosis.
  - Chronic inflammatory bowel disease.
  - Spondyloarthropathies.
- IgA nephropathy in rheumatoid purpura:
  - Systemic vasculitis of small-calibre arteries with IgA.
  - More common in children than adults.
  - Extra-renal signs: vascular purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, myalgia.
  - NIgA is sometimes severe with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome.

**Title:** Knowing the definition of the different techniques for preserving female and male fertility (child, adolescent, adult)  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Definition  

There are several fertility preservation techniques, adapted to the age and sex/gender of patients, the gonadotoxic treatment envisaged (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery), the pathology that may impair fertility, and the general medical context of patients. It is important to warn patients that none of these techniques can guarantee a pregnancy.

In non-medical fertility preservation indications, only oocytes or sperm can be preserved (Bioethics Law 2021).

Prior to freezing, oocytes, spermatozoa, embryos, and germ tissue are packaged in tubes (germ tissue) or straws (oocytes, embryos, spermatozoa, and germ tissue) containing a cryoprotective medium. Frozen biological samples are stored in containers containing liquid nitrogen at -196°C.

**Female Fertility Preservation Techniques**

In pubescent girls and women, two techniques are possible:

- Freezing or storage of mature oocytes or embryos, which requires prior hormonal stimulation. As with IVF, the ovaries are stimulated with hormones, and an ultrasound-guided oocyte puncture is then performed vaginally. The mature oocytes recovered can either be frozen and stored at -196°C or used in fertilization for patients in couples who so wish, before freezing and storing the embryos.  
  - However, this oocyte or embryo freezing technique has several disadvantages:
    - It requires at least two weeks (stimulation and oocyte puncture): it is therefore not indicated in situations where potentially gonadotoxic treatment is required as a matter of extreme urgency.
    - It induces a supra-physiological increase in estradiol, which is potentially harmful in certain hormone-dependent diseases (e.g., hormone-dependent breast cancer).

- Freezing and storage of mature oocytes without prior hormonal stimulation. This is accompanied by prior in vitro maturation of immature oocytes. This involves puncturing the immature oocytes contained in the small antral follicles without injecting any hormone. The recovered oocytes are then matured ""in vitro"" in the laboratory for 24 to 48 hours. Only the oocytes that have matured are frozen or used for fertilization with a view to embryo freezing for patients in couples who so wish. This technique can be carried out as an emergency, regardless of the phase of the menstrual cycle.

If the patient in a couple chooses to keep embryos, she will only be able to reuse them later as a couple and with the same living spouse (the embryo belongs to the couple whereas the oocyte belongs only to the patient).

It should be noted that the fertilization method for mature oocytes stored will necessarily be ICSI.

- Ovarian cortex freezing or preservation involves removing part of an ovary or an entire ovary, usually during laparoscopy. The cortex, containing the stock of primordial follicles, is isolated and then cut into fragments which are then frozen at -196°C. For reuse, the fragments of ovarian cortex are grafted onto either the remaining ovary or the peritoneum. Autografting has the advantage of restoring endogenous hormone secretion as well as fertility. It has proved its effectiveness in humans, with more than 130 children born worldwide up to 2021 after an ovarian cortex autograft (spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies induced by IVF). The major risk of this transplant is, in the case of malignant pathologies, the ""reintroduction of the initial disease"" through the tumor cells present in the ovarian fragments. To avoid this risk, other reuse procedures are being developed and are still in the field of research (in vitro follicular maturation in the laboratory using primordial follicles from the preserved ovarian cortex or alternative grafting procedures using previously isolated primordial ovarian follicles).

In addition, injections of GnRH agonists aimed at ""resting"" the ovaries (to protect the pool of primordial follicles from the effects of chemotherapy) may be proposed, even if this has not been shown to be effective.

In addition, it is possible to propose ovarian transposition during pelvic radiotherapy in order to limit the gonadotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on the ovary.

In prepubescent girls, ovarian cortex freezing or conservation will be the only possible preservation technique.

**Male Fertility Preservation Techniques**

- In pubescent adolescents and adult men, freezing or preserving ejaculated spermatozoa is the technique most often used (sperm collected by masturbation in the laboratory).
- In prepubertal boys, there are no spermatozoa present in the testicles, only germ stem cells. Freezing or preserving testicular tissue may therefore be proposed. The possible future use of frozen testicular tissue is currently still in the field of research, with regard to ""in vitro"" spermatogenesis, testicular tissue grafting, and germ cell transplantation.",1.0,15.518181818181823,False,True,0.7497279047966003,0.0,c,False,5,2

Social protection is based on:

1. The payment of social benefits directly to individuals. These social benefits can be in cash with replacement income (daily allowances, retirement pensions) or in kind (reimbursement of expenses incurred such as healthcare costs or direct funding of services).

2. Access to social services provided free of charge or at reduced prices (e.g., crèches, canteen meals).

There are six categories of benefits corresponding to various risks:

- **Old Age-Survival Risk**
  - Old age is the most significant risk. It includes pensions, which are the largest part of this risk and social protection. It also covers care for dependency, not yet recognized as a separate risk, despite the introduction of the personalized autonomy allowance (APA) by the law of 20 July 2001, and the National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy, created by the law of 30 June 2004. Additionally, it includes benefits under the minimum old-age pension: the supplementary old-age allowance (ASV) and the solidarity allowance for the elderly (ASPA).
  - Survivors' risk covers needs arising from the death of a family member, usually the spouse.

- **Health Risk**
  - This includes illness, disability, accidents at work, and occupational diseases.

- **Maternity-Family Risk**
  - This includes daily maternity benefits, care for pregnant women, and various family benefits (family allowances, childcare subsidies).

- **Employment Risk**
  - This includes unemployment compensation, aid for vocational rehabilitation and reintegration, and early retirement.

- **Housing Risk**

Discrimination in healthcare is not solely due to social perceptions or a lack of vigilance by healthcare providers. It involves systemic malfunctions, a failure to provide care, or a reduction in the quality of care.

Several structural and organizational factors have been identified and are listed in the Migration Santé Alsace publication ""Vers plus d'égalité en santé: guide de prévention et de lutte contre les discriminations"" (2019).

- **Asymmetrical Power Relationships in Care:** Patients may feel illegitimate and therefore refrain from asking questions or expressing their preferences.
  
- **Heterogeneous Practices:** Some care teams lack the necessary conditions to reflect on malfunctions that can lead to discrimination.
  
- **Territorial Inequalities in Healthcare Provision:** In areas with healthcare desertification or shortages, refusal of care is not distributed equitably.
  
- **Lack of Coordination:** This can lead to some caregivers refusing to treat certain patients deemed more difficult to treat.
  
- **Insufficient Use of Professional Interpreters:** Despite the challenges of providing care without a common language, professional interpreters are underutilized.
  
- **Economic Logic in Tension with Care Objectives:** The pursuit of profitability can reinforce differential patient orientation, leading to poorer treatment for patients perceived as more complicated.

**Title:** Definition of Maternal-Fetal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection

**Rubric:** Definition

Maternal CMV infection is the first cause of congenital viral infection and the first non-hereditary cause of sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation in early childhood.

Maternal-fetal transmission is possible in the periconceptional period (1 month before to 3 weeks after the start of pregnancy: 15% risk).

The overall transmission rate during pregnancy averages 40%. It increases with gestational age (36% in the 1st trimester, 40% in the 2nd, 65% in the 3rd).

Among infected children:
- 10% will develop a severe prenatal infection (intrauterine growth retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, intracranial calcifications, fetal death in utero) ""Anomaly of psychomotor development (SD-115)""
- 10% are apparently healthy at birth but will have neurosensory sequelae (deafness in particular)
- 80% will have an asymptomatic form

Maternal reinfections also expose the child to these risks, although less frequently.

Severity is correlated with term: lower risk of transmission at the beginning of pregnancy but more severe forms.

In the event of maternal infection, the patient should be referred to a prenatal diagnosis center to discuss management (antiviral/amniocentesis/ultrasound/MRI).

The use of high-dose valaciclovir could reduce the risk of congenital infection for infections in the 1st trimester of pregnancy when introduced rapidly.

Systematic screening by maternal serology for this frequent infection during pregnancy is not currently recommended in France.",0.6,11.706666666666667,False,True,0.7224105596542358,0.0,b,False,2,3

Type 2 diabetes is characterized by poor use of insulin by the body's cells. It is linked to impaired insulin secretion capacity (relative insulinopenia) and insulin resistance.  

Hyperglycemia itself (glucotoxicity), lipotoxicity, and the presence of chronic low-grade inflammation all contribute to impaired insulin secretion.

Several factors are involved in the impairment of insulin secretion capacity, including genetic predisposition.

Insulin resistance is favored by environmental factors, including a sedentary lifestyle and overeating.

**Description:** Recognize an alveolar opacity and an air bronchogram  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

**Definitions:** Imaging of abnormal filling of the pulmonary alveoli with dense material (transudate, exudate, blood, pus, etc.). The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. Other causes include intra-alveolar hemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organized pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.

The definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:
- Pulmonary opacity (denser or ""whiter"" than normal parenchyma)
- Containing images of aerated bronchi (aerated bronchogram)

The term ""systemic"" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe, or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe. The silhouette sign can help localize the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term ""retractile"" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum, or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, it is referred to as atelectasis.

CT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary edema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.

**Special Presentations:**
- Acute lobar frank pneumonia: Non-retractable systematized alveolar syndrome in a patient with fever and cough.
- Some bacterial, fungal, or viral pneumonias may present as multiple poorly limited alveolar opacities.
- Acute pulmonary edema: Bilateral, symmetrical, peri-hilar alveolar syndrome, often associated with bilateral pleural effusion.
- Alveolar bronchial cancer: More or less extensive alveolar opacities, sometimes nodular, containing an aerated bronchogram, in a patient at risk of bronchial cancer.
- Intra-alveolar hemorrhage: Alveolar opacities, the topography of which indicates the site of bleeding.
- Organized pneumonia (cryptogenic or secondary): Alveolar opacities are bilateral and migratory.

The risk of recurrence depends on the karyotype:

- Free, complete, and homogeneous trisomy 21: recurrence risk of approximately 1% unless the mother is over 40 (risk then linked to the mother's age).
- Mosaic trisomy 21: low risk of recurrence.
- Trisomy 21 by translocation: high risk of recurrence if translocation inherited from a parent.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (14;21)
    - If of maternal origin: risk of recurrence 10-15%.
    - If of paternal origin: risk of recurrence 2-5%.
  - Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (21;21)
    - Risk of recurrence: 100% if inherited from a healthy parent (non-viable monosomy 21).

In the case of free trisomy 21, it is not necessary to carry out the parents' karyotype (de novo occurrence, generally due to meiotic non-disjunction).

In the case of trisomy 21 by translocation, it is necessary to carry out karyotyping of the parents. In the event of a balanced anomaly in one parent, the family branch concerned should be further investigated to identify other carriers.

The increased risk of recurrence after the birth of a child with Down's syndrome means that parents can request a foetal karyotype if they wish.

If the parents do not wish to take the risk of miscarriage, prenatal diagnosis (PND) can be offered.

Men with Down's syndrome have reduced fertility. A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome, and the children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced, but pregnancies are possible. The risk of trisomy 21 is around 30% in women with trisomy 21.",0.0,10.500000000000004,False,True,0.849852979183197,0.0,a,True,4,4

The power of a study is its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false.

More rarely, power may be the ability to show an absence of difference (non-inferiority trial or equivalence trial).

The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:

- **Size of sample analyzed (N):** If N increases, power increases.
- **Difference to be detected (d):** If d increases, power increases.
- **Variability of observations (variance):** If variance increases, power decreases.
- **Alpha risk:** If alpha increases, power increases.
- **One-tailed or two-tailed test:** If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.

In practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).",0.6666666666666666,7.773333333333333,False,True,0.7868215441703796,0.0,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing the Most Common Clinical Manifestations of Internal Hemorrhoids  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis

Haemorrhoidal symptoms linked to the internal plexuses can be expressed in two ways: either noisily over a short period of time (haemorrhoidal crisis) or as long-lasting symptoms accentuated during and after defecation.

Haemorrhoidal crisis combines, to varying degrees, a sensation of burning, tension, or sharp pain in the anus, red defecatory bleeding (anal epistaxis) which can be significant but is not mixed with stool, and sensitive anal swelling or a perception of internal tension. Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days, often accentuated by defecation.

When the signs become chronic, they often include defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant prolapse of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. These symptoms may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.

The classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:

- Grade I: No prolapse in the anoscopic lumen.
- Grade II: Prolapse in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside.
- Grade III: Prolapse outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing.
- Grade IV: Permanent prolapse from the outset. In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus, and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualize them.

The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in looking for associated lesions: anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.",1.0,10.73,False,True,0.8147145509719849,0.0,a,False,1,3

Several definitions of heart failure co-exist:

- From a pathophysiological point of view, heart failure is defined as an inability of the heart to deliver sufficient flow to meet the body's needs and/or to function with normal filling pressures.

- There is also a universal definition of chronic heart failure (CHF): this is a clinical syndrome with past or present symptoms of CHF (dyspnoea, fatigue) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac anomaly and confirmed by several elements: clinical signs of heart failure (crackles, ankle oedema, jugular turgidity); an elevated level of natriuretic peptide; haemodynamic echocardiographic radiological signs.

Heart failure is classified according to the level of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which corresponds to the proportion of blood ejected with each beat in relation to the ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEF (%) = (end-diastolic volume - telesystolic volume)/end-diastolic volume). Three types of heart failure are classically distinguished:

- Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%) caused by failure of myocardial contraction.

- Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%, generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.

- Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (LVEF ≥50%). This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).

This definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%).

The LVEF calculation involves determining the endocardial contours in telediastole on the left and telesystolic on the right.",0.0,7.368571428571428,False,True,0.7503895163536072,0.0,a,False,2,4

- Two out of three patients are not relieved by their treatment.
- More than 60% of patients admitted to emergency departments experience moderate to severe pain, and less than one in two receive analgesic treatment on admission.
- Almost 20% of patients who undergo surgery are left with painful after-effects.
- 45% of chronic pain patients take time off work for an average of more than 4 months a year.
- Chronic pain patients take five times more time off work compared to the general population.
- More than 70% of patients suffering from chronic pain experience psychosocial repercussions, including sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, and cognitive problems.

**Pain in the City**

- Pain is the number one reason for consultations, both in emergency departments and with general practitioners.
- Less than 3% of chronic pain patients are treated in a specialized pain center or facility, which acts as a multi-professional referral center for the most complex patients in conjunction with outpatient care.

**Pain in Hospital**

- Induced pain: Caused by the caregiver during clinical examination to identify mechanisms involved, providing useful information for management.
- Iatrogenic pain: Unintentionally caused by the caregiver or treatment in foreseeable circumstances. This includes pain induced by care (such as re-dressing of dressings, sutures, vascular punctures, mobilization in intensive care) or by diagnostic examinations (such as biopsies), sometimes referred to as procedural pain.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are frequently associated with atherosclerosis, affecting coronary arteries, carotid arteries, arteries of the lower limbs, and renal and digestive arteries. The existence of familial forms suggests a genetic component in some cases. Vascular prostheses can be complicated by false anastomotic aneurysms.

In rare cases, AAAs may be due to:

- Infectious aneurysm
- Aneurysmal evolution of an aortic dissection
- Hereditary connective tissue dystrophies (e.g., Marfan's disease, vascular Ehlers-Danlos disease, Loeys-Dietz syndrome)
- Inflammatory aortitis (e.g., Takayasu's disease, Horton's disease, and Behçet's disease)

AAA must be detected by ultrasound of the abdominal aorta, often discovered as an abdominal anomaly on medical imaging. This screening is recommended for patients at risk, who include:

Doctors must inform patients of the possibility of prenatal screening for trisomy 21 (SD-307), which is covered by the health insurance scheme but is not compulsory.

Screening includes a combined 1st trimester test based on:

- Maternal age
- Nuchal translucency measurement in the 1st trimester
- Measurement of serum markers in the 1st trimester (PAPP-A, free beta-HCG)

The course of action varies according to the result of the combined test:

- If the risk is less than 1/1000, simple pregnancy monitoring is recommended.
- If the risk is between 1/51 and 1/1000, non-invasive prenatal screening is proposed (test on free foetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, DPNI):
  - If the DPNI is negative: continuation of the usual ultrasound monitoring of the pregnancy.
  - If the DPNI is positive: proposal of a foetal karyotype. The FISH test has a very good positive and negative predictive value, but does not allow a definite diagnosis of trisomy 21 to be made. Therefore, no termination of pregnancy will be carried out on the basis of a positive result from an NIPD test.
- If the risk is greater than or equal to 1/50, a foetal karyotype is proposed straight away. However, the woman may ask to undergo an INFP.

If it has not been possible to carry out screening in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, it is possible to propose the measurement of serum markers in the 2nd trimester (hCG, alpha-feto-protein, oestriol).",1.0,6.2755555555555596,False,True,0.7769988775253296,0.0,c,False,3,3

The Bi-Rad Classification is used to assess breast lesions. Lesions classified as Bi-rads 4 and 5 (imaging classification) must be biopsied, as must lesions classified as Bi-rads 3 in BRCA mutated patients or patients who are otherwise carriers of a malignant biopsied lesion.

These biopsies are carried out preoperatively, reducing the need for peroperative extemporaneous examination and making it possible to define a course of action with the patient before the operation.

Breast biopsies are performed in two ways: microbiopsies or macrobiopsies. Microbiopsies are usually performed under ultrasound guidance (ultrasound mass), and macrobiopsies are usually performed under stereotaxis (mammographic microcalcification focus). Macrobiopsies may also be performed under MRI when the lesion classified as Bi-rads 4 or 5 is not visible on mammography or ultrasound. The biopsy is used to confirm the histological diagnosis and assess a number of prognostic factors.

Cytology samples are not recommended for a mass or a focus of microcalcifications. However, cytology of a suspicious axillary adenopathy or of a nipple discharge in the case of a suspicious discharge (bloody) may be useful.

**Rubric:** Additional Tests  

SynACTHene® (tetracosactide) is an ACTH analogue. It directly explores primary adrenal insufficiency and indirectly the possibility of corticotropic insufficiency by testing for adrenal atrophy resulting from the lack of stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.

**The Synacthen Test Consists of:**

- Cortisol measurement before the test (at 8 hours)
- IM or IV administration of a 250 µg ampoule of tetracosactide
- Followed by a cortisol measurement at 1 hour (+/- 30 min)

**Interpretation:**

- Peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates no response to the Synacthen test, suggesting adrenal insufficiency, regardless of the aetiology.
- Cortisolemia ≥ 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) indicates a normal response, ruling out adrenal insufficiency except in cases of recent or partial adrenocortical insufficiency. This is because the adrenal cortex is not atrophied and can respond to a high dose of exogenous ACTH during the test (e.g., acquired corticotropic insufficiency following surgery for a pituitary adenoma, when the corticotropic axis was normal pre-operatively).

**Additional Stimulation Tests:**

- Two other stimulation tests can be conducted in a hospital setting: insulin hypoglycaemia or the Metopirone test.

If the pre-test cortisol is <5 ng/ml (138 nmol/l), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made without the need for a SynACTHene stimulation test. Outside a situation of major physical stress, if cortisol is >500 nmol/l, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ruled out, and the stimulation test is not necessary.",1.0,6.2755555555555596,False,True,0.7555254697799683,0.0,a,False,1,4

The paraclinical investigations to be carried out as a first-line assessment of BPH are:

- **ECBU:** Used to test for haematuria and urinary tract infections, which are differential diagnoses of BPH.

- **Flowmetry:** Used to identify urinary disorders and incontinence in adults and the elderly. The key parameters in its interpretation are the maximum flow rate and the shape of the curve.
  - A urine volume >150mL provides a more reliable assessment.
  - A maximum flow rate < 15ml/s is considered pathological.
  - A normal curve is bell-shaped, whereas a flat curve indicates an emptying disorder.

**Rubric:** Management  

Since the development of medical techniques, the bodily signs of illness are no longer observed only by the eye of the caregiver but also by a range of technical devices: thermometers, stethoscopes, medical imaging, biological analyses, etc. These tools have redefined how illnesses are perceived and understood, as well as how bodies are approached. They act as an interface between caregiver and patient, observer and observed, redefining the boundaries between the inside and outside of the body. This transformation turns the materiality of the body into a set of variables, images, and data that can be reductionist.

The observation process comes with its own terminology, which can create a gap between the patient's subjective experience and the way medicine objectifies their body.

In the context of the human body, the human sciences often distinguish between a body-object and a body-subject. The body-object is impersonal, governed by natural laws, and devoid of specifically human characteristics, serving as an object of action or contemplation. The body-subject refers to both the subjective body, as the psychophysiological basis of individual experience, and the subject's body, as the dimension of corporeity on which human action is exercised. In healthcare, this distinction helps to relativize and clarify knowledge about the body, whether healthy or ill, without reducing the caregiver's focus to a single aspect of physicality. The body cannot be reduced to a collection of organs, a set of figures or laboratory images, or solely to the patient's personal narrative.",0.75,11.693684210526317,False,True,0.7459532022476196,0.0,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Know how to diagnose the removal of a prosthetic valve, including haemolysis  

**Definitions:**

There are two main causes of prosthesis deinsertion:

- Early onset: Loosening of the suture of the prosthesis or paravalvular leakage due to significant calcification.
- Medium- or long-term onset: Deleterious infective endocarditis, which should be systematically investigated.

The clinical picture varies, depending on the severity of the induced regurgitation and the speed at which it develops. Disinsertion may be completely asymptomatic or may progress to a state of cardiogenic shock.

**Physical Examination:**

- A regurgitant murmur is noted, diastolic at the aortic site for a prosthesis in the aortic position, and systolic at the mitral site for a prosthesis in the mitral position.

**Key Examinations:**

- The primary examination is Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE), generally supplemented by Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE).
- Colour Doppler can identify a paraprosthetic leak, i.e., a leak between the prosthesis and the native valve annulus.
- Ultrasound is used to quantify the leak and assess its impact, particularly on the left ventricle.

**Laboratory Tests:**

- Blood cultures should be taken systematically to avoid missing infective endocarditis.
- Biologically, there is generally a nonspecific inflammatory syndrome and sometimes haemolysis. In haemolysis, LDH is increased, and haptoglobin is reduced. The presence of schizocytes indicates the mechanical origin of the anaemia.

**Management:**

- If the deinsertion is moderate, stable, asymptomatic, and has no impact on the TTE, simple monitoring may suffice.

=Identify a Medication Error, Its Mechanisms, and Know the Consequences=

==Definition==
According to the French National Authority for Health, a medicinal product error is defined as any preventable event that could cause or lead to the inappropriate use of a medicinal product or harm to the patient when the medicinal product is under the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or user. This is an unintentional act involving the medicinal product during the care process. A medicinal product error is said to have occurred when the error has been confirmed, and a ""near miss"" or potential error when the error has been identified and avoided in time.

==Mechanisms==
A medication error may be linked to professional practice, healthcare products, procedures, and systems covering the entire medication circuit: prescribing, communication of the prescription, dispensing, preparation, distribution, administration, education, therapeutic monitoring/follow-up, and use. Causes directly related to the product may also be found, linked to the labeling, packaging, or nomenclature of the product.

==Characterization of an Error==
- Its classification: ""error, potential error, or risk of error.""
- Its stage: prescribing, dispensing, preparation, administration, therapeutic follow-up, etc.
- The nature of the error: drug, dose, dosage/concentration, route of administration, flow rate, administration technique, patient, time of administration, duration of administration, omission, etc.
- Their causes: communication problems, human factors, name confusion, labeling and/or information problems, packaging or design problems, etc.

==Consequences==
A medication error can result in:
- An adverse event resulting in harm to the patient
- A near miss in which the patient almost suffered harm
- No harm or risk of harm",0.25,,False,False,0.846102237701416,0.0,a,False,2,4

**Understanding the Role of Coronary Angiography in the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Coronary Syndrome**

**Definitions**

**Coronary Angiography:**  
This procedure is used to identify the coronary lesion responsible and decide on its treatment, which may include angioplasty with a stent, coronary bypass surgery, or medical treatment alone. It is an invasive examination requiring pre-operative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure.

**Principles of ACS Management**

- **ST+ ACS:** The emergency is coronary unblocking.
  - Assessment of the time between the ECG (diagnosis of ST+) and arrival in the coronary angiography suite for placement of the angioplasty guide (start of angioplasty).
  - If delay ≤ 120 minutes, primary angioplasty is recommended.
  - If > 120 minutes, fibrinolysis is preferred (unless contraindicated, except for symptoms >12 hours) followed by salvage angioplasty in the absence of reperfusion or deferred within 24 hours if reperfusion occurs.
  - For ACS >12 hours after onset of pain: primary angioplasty remains indicated in cases of persistent pain, hemodynamic instability, or rhythmic instability (ventricular rhythm disorders). Angioplasty should be considered up to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms; beyond that, in the absence of chest pain, viability should first be sought in the infarcted territory.

- **Non-ST+ ACS:** Coronary angiography is generally performed within 24 hours, particularly if troponin is elevated. Note: In the special case of non-ST+ ACS refractory to medical treatment (patient still in pain), the patient must be taken urgently (<2 hours) to the coronary angiography suite.",0.4444444444444444,18.525263157894738,False,True,0.8472042083740234,0.0,b,False,4,3

**1. General Principles of Migraine Treatment**

- **Factors Triggering Attacks:** Encourage a regular lifestyle with sufficient sleep, regular waking hours, balanced meals, optimal hydration, and physical activity. Discourage avoidance behaviors like extreme diets, which can reduce quality of life.

- **Types of Treatment:**

  - **Crisis Treatment:** Administer during each crisis to relieve headache within 2 hours, without recurrence within 24 hours. No treatment shortens auras. Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics.

    - *Mild Onset Seizure:* Paracetamol.
    - *Mild Attacks (if paracetamol fails) and Moderate to Severe Attacks:* An NSAID and a triptan on the same prescription, not exceeding 2 days a week or 8 days a month.
    - Assess effectiveness after 3 attacks.

  - **Background Treatment:** Reduce frequency and severity of seizures in eligible patients. Aim to reduce headache days by 50% for episodic migraine and 30% for chronic migraine.

    - Non-specific treatments include beta-blockers, tricyclics, and anti-epileptic migraine drugs.
    - Slow onset of treatment; assess efficacy after 3 months.
    - If effective, continue for 6 to 12 months, then gradually reduce.
    - Specific treatments for severe migraines (8+ attack days/month) after failure of at least 2 oral treatments: antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway (not reimbursed).

- **Chronic Migraine with Drug Abuse:**

  - Prescribe background medication.
  - Advise outpatient weaning off over-used medication.
  - Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, aiming for 8 treatment days per month.

- **For Migraines Affecting Quality of Life:** Non-medicinal treatments such as physical exercise, physiotherapy, and psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation) are proposed as complements to medicinal treatment.

**2. General Principles of the Treatment of Tension-Type Headache**

- **Information:** Explain that psychological tension can lead to headaches through excessive muscular tension.

- **Crisis Treatment:** Use paracetamol, aspirin, or NSAID, not exceeding 2 days per week or 8 days per month. Avoid opiates.

- **Background Treatment:** For frequent or chronic tension-type headaches, primarily use amitriptyline, increasing gradually to the maximum tolerated dose (10 to 50 mg). Other options include venlafaxine, gabapentin, and duloxetine.

- **Withdrawal:** In case of analgesic or NSAID abuse.

- **Non-Medicinal Treatment:** Encourage a healthy lifestyle, reduce sedentary behavior, and consider physiotherapy, relaxation, and cognitive-behavioral therapies for stress management.

**3. General Principles of the Treatment of Vascular Facial Pain**

- **Reassurance and Explanation:** Although benign, significant disability is possible. ENT, dental, and ophthalmological exams are unnecessary for typical attacks.

- **Assess Socio-Professional and Psychological Impact.**

- **General Measures:** Avoid alcohol, maintain regular sleep schedules, avoid naps, and encourage smoking cessation (though it does not lead to recovery).

- **Types of Treatment:**

  - **Crisis Treatments:** Taken during each crisis to relieve headache but do not prevent new attacks.

    - Subcutaneous sumatriptan injection relieves pain in 3 to 15 minutes, with a maximum of 2 injections per day. Sumatriptan spray may also be effective.
    - Oxygen therapy (12 to 15 L/min for 15 to 20 minutes) using a high-flow face mask is effective and reimbursed, prescribed by a neurologist, ENT specialist, or algology center.

  - **Background Treatments:** Useful for some patients to reduce attack frequency and severity.

    - Verapamil is first-line (120 mg, twice a day) after an ECG to check for contraindications. Higher doses may be used.
    - Other options include corticosteroid therapy for very frequent attacks, lithium carbonate for chronic forms, and surgical treatments for drug-resistant chronic forms.

**4. General Principles of the Treatment of Trigeminal Neuralgia**

- **Drug Treatment:**

  - Carbamazepine (400 to 1,600 mg/d), gradually increased, taken 2 or 3 times a day, 1/2 hour before meals. Side effects are common in elderly patients (drowsiness, dizziness, ataxia).
  - If intolerant, use oxcarbamazepine. Baclofen may be used alone or with carbamazepine. Other drugs include lamotrigine and gabapentin.
  - Treatment is the same for classic, secondary (e.g., to MS), or idiopathic neuralgia.

- **Surgical Treatments:** Offered when drug therapy fails.

  - Destruction of the trigeminal tract via gamma-knife radiosurgery, thermocoagulation, or balloon compression of Gasser's ganglion.
  - Surgery to decompress vascular-nervous impingement requires demonstration via strict MRI criteria.

**Title:** Knowing the Mechanisms Regulating Acid-Base Balance  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

**A. pH and the Acid-Base Buffer System**

- Hydrogen potential (pH) = Log 1/[H⁺]. The concentration of H⁺ ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.
- The quantity of H⁺ entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ ⇔ H₂CO₃ ⇔ CO₂ + H₂O.
- This buffer system is ""open"" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.
- Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH_blood = 6.1 + log₁₀ ([HCO₃⁻]/[H₂CO₃]) = 6.1 + log₁₀ ([HCO₃⁻]/0.03 PCO₂).
- The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO₂ and HCO₃⁻ is modified:
  - When there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO₃⁻ ions, known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis.
  - When there is a primary change in PCO₂, known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.

**B. The Main Sources of Acid**

- There are two main sources of acid:
  - Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O₂, water and CO₂ (oxidative metabolism). The CO₂ generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO₂ leads to respiratory acidosis.
  - Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H₂SO₄ for sulfur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H₂PO₄ for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.

**C. Role of the Lung in Acid-Base Balance**

- By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO₂ of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO₂ through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO₂ by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.
- Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO₂ and pCO₂, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.

**D. Role of the Kidney in Acid-Base Balance**

- Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.
- Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.",0.5,3.650000000000002,False,True,0.7081388235092163,0.5806097189585367,a,False,2,2

**Definitions**

The Social Security Financing Act establishes the general conditions for the financial equilibrium of the social security system and, based on revenue forecasts, sets expenditure targets. It is passed each year by parliament following a government bill.

The Social Security Financing Act (LFSS) is a category of law created by the revision of the Constitution on 22 February 1996. It aims to control social and health spending. It determines the conditions necessary for the financial equilibrium of social security and sets expenditure targets based on revenue forecasts.

It should be emphasized that this is a financing law rather than a finance law, indicating that the LFSS is not of the same nature as the State's finance laws; in particular, they have no budgetary scope. Parliamentary control remains limited. Parliament does not have the power to set social security revenues itself. The LFSS does not authorize the collection of revenue; it merely forecasts it. Similarly, the expenditure targets voted by Parliament assess expenditure but do not limit it.

The LFSS is voted on by Parliament every year, at the same time as the Finance Act (LF) that determines the State budget. It must be submitted to the National Assembly by 15 October at the latest. Parliament must vote on it within 50 days; otherwise, the PLFSS may be adopted by ordinance. It may also be amended during the year by an amending LFSS.

Since 1996, Parliament has had a say in the financial equilibrium of the social security system. It can give its opinion on the broad outlines of health and social security policies, as well as on the way they are financed.

Examples of new measures include:
- Extending paternity leave from 14 days to 28 days and making it compulsory for 7 days.
- Increasing the salaries of hospital staff and those working in accommodation establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD).
- Funding expenditure on tests, vaccines, and masks to respond to the health crisis.

The foetal karyotype is performed on a sample of:

- Chorionic villus (CVS) between 12 and 14 weeks of amenorrhoea
- Amniotic fluid (PLA) between 15 weeks of amenorrhoea and the end of pregnancy
- Exceptionally on foetal blood after 24 weeks of amenorrhoea

The risks are:

- Risk of foeto-placental discordance (1-2%) for CVS
- Risk of crop failure
- Risk of infection following sampling
- Risk of miscarriage estimated at 0.5% following CVS and 0.2% following PLA
- Risk of foetomaternal Rh(D) alloimmunisation in Rh(D) women; prophylaxis by injection of anti-D immunoglobulins should be considered
- Risk of bradycardia following puncture of foetal blood

Time taken to obtain results:

- The CVS allows a response within 2-3 days on direct examination, and 2-3 weeks for the definitive culture result.
- Karyotype results from amniocentesis take 2 to 3 weeks. A faster technique (24-48 hours) using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y on interphase nuclei can be used to obtain rapid results in the event of an ultrasound anomaly suggestive of foetal aneuploidy.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the two main entities of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).

**Deep Vein Thrombosis**

This is a partial or total venous obstruction caused by an endoluminal thrombus, which may be located throughout the venous tree, most often in the lower limbs.

In the lower limbs, DVT is:

- Proximal (popliteal and suprapopliteal)
- Distal, i.e., sub-popliteal, involving the collecting trunks (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, fibular) or muscle veins (soleus, gastrocnemius)

**Pulmonary Embolism**

PE occurs when a venous thrombus migrates into the pulmonary arteries.

**High-Risk PE (Severe PE)**

- PE associated with haemodynamic failure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or drop in SBP ≥ 40 mmHg for more than 15 minutes), in the absence of another cause such as sepsis, arrhythmia, or hypovolaemia.

**Rubric:** Definition  

**Definitions**

There are two sources of error in estimating a parameter:

- **Random Error:** Due to sampling fluctuation, it causes a decrease in the precision of estimates. It depends on sample size; the larger the sample size, the more precise the estimates.
- **Systematic Error (Bias):** Not due to chance, the presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. It is independent of sample size.

**Three Major Families of Bias:**

- **Selection Bias:** Linked to the choice of method of selection and/or follow-up (attrition bias linked to loss to follow-up in longitudinal studies) of subjects, leading to the sample analyzed ultimately corresponding to a population different from the target population. It threatens the representativeness and external validity of the study.
- **Classification Bias:** Linked to the measurement of exposure and/or the judgment criterion. The reality of an individual's status (e.g., truly obese) is not correctly collected in the study (e.g., faulty scales systematically giving 3 kilos less). Memory bias is an example of information bias linked to the unreliability of self-reported data.
- **Confusion Bias:** Related to the fact that the observed relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied may be distorted by not taking into account a third factor (confounding factor) itself associated with both the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied.

**Selection and Information Biases:**

- They relate to descriptive and analytical objectives.
- They may lead to an over- or under-estimation of measures of frequency and measures of association.
- They result from errors (avoidable or not) committed by the investigators (e.g., diagnostic errors, wrong choice of control group, refusal of participation of eligible subjects, lost to follow-up in a cohort). They must be identified and controlled at the time of protocol preparation and cannot be corrected at the time of analysis.

**Confounding Biases:**

- They relate only to analytic objectives.
- They may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the measures of association.
- They do not arise from errors made by the investigators but reflect the nature of things. They should be anticipated when planning the study (e.g., restriction of inclusion criteria, matching, randomization if possible, collection of potential confounders) and can be corrected in the analysis (e.g., stratification, adjustment).",0.5,10.723333333333333,False,True,0.7080380916595459,0.0,a,False,3,3

**Description:** Understanding the legal provisions governing prenatal diagnosis and the ethical issues involved in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in the context of prenatal diagnosis: women, couples, and professionals faced with complex choices.

== Definitions ==

**A. Ethics and Prenatal Diagnosis (PND)**

Prenatal diagnosis (PND) was defined by the Bioethics Act of 29 July 1994 as all ""medical practices aimed at detecting a particularly serious condition in the embryo or foetus in utero."" This activity is supervised by the Agence de biomédecine, a public body established by the law of 6 August 2004.

The main tools for PND are ultrasound and the study of foetal DNA and/or the foetal karyotype following invasive sampling (choriocentesis, amniocentesis, or cordocentesis). Ethical considerations led to the introduction of a legal framework for PND in 1994 with the Bioethics Act and its successive revisions. The law specifies the purpose of PND: ""to prevent or treat a particularly serious condition, in the interests of the unborn child.""

Advances in foetal imaging and human genetics applied to foetal medicine are highly debated. Initially focused on serious monogenic childhood diseases, prenatal diagnosis began with the detection of trisomy 21. The population concerned by prenatal diagnosis expanded due to the authorisation of termination of pregnancy for medical reasons (IMG) under the law of 17 January 1975, the development of ultrasound monitoring, and the appearance of biological techniques for assessing the risk of trisomy 21.

Progress in PND often outpaces therapy, leading to situations where recognising a disease means acknowledging the lack of available treatment, prompting some couples to request termination due to potential early or late-onset diseases.

In France, IMG is authorised ""at any time during pregnancy,"" and the law avoids automatic decision-making by not listing diseases that qualify for IMG. Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, considering the context and individual situations.

CPDPNs face requests for IMGs for late-onset genetic diseases, such as foetuses carrying the BRCA 1 gene. The legitimacy of certain requests is questioned, especially regarding the criteria for terminating a pregnancy. The debate includes the acceptance of disability in society and the quality of life for individuals with varying levels of awareness and autonomy.

The ethical process of deciding on pregnancy termination involves questioning terms like ""high probability,"" ""incurability,"" and ""particular seriousness,"" which are subjective and vary among individuals. Ongoing dialogue with the couple is crucial, requiring time and energy from multidisciplinary teams.

**B. The Specific Case of Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening (NIPS)**

Since 2013, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPT) for trisomy 21 has been available in France. This test uses foetal DNA circulating in the mother's blood, allowing earlier detection (around eight to ten weeks' amenorrhoea) with high sensitivity and specificity.

NIPT is revolutionising PND by enabling the study of other foetal genome characteristics. Current debates focus on access conditions for this test, including the search for other anomalies or sex diagnosis.

The implementation of foetal DNA analysis in maternal blood should be subject to applied research to understand professional and patient perceptions. The globalisation of healthcare access and e-health may lead women to conduct tests independently, necessitating new frameworks and rules.

The development of NIPT raises questions about its impact on pregnancy termination requests. The possibility of conducting the test before the first trimester's end challenges the distinction between abortion and IMG in French law. The ethical framework changes if results are communicated before 16 weeks' gestation, potentially leading to abortion requests based on biological results.

Healthcare professionals need clarity on the future status of NIPT in pregnancy monitoring. While few professionals oppose prescribing the test, debates continue on its legitimate indications and associated questions.

**Key Points**

- PND is designed to detect serious conditions in the embryo or foetus, allowing parents to decide on pregnancy termination and better medical management if continued.
- When a foetal anomaly is detected, the CPDPN certifies the probability of a serious, incurable condition, enabling medical termination if the pregnant woman decides.
- NIPS allows early selection of foetal sex or genetic screening for pathology markers. Careful targeting of indications and timing of result communication is necessary, especially concerning voluntary termination limits.",0.75,8.009090909090911,False,True,0.8142837285995483,0.0,b,False,2,3

**Title:** Know How to Diagnose Pain in Elderly Patients

**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

### Overview

- The elderly population is diverse in terms of biological aging and cognitive decline, which may be linked to age or neurodegenerative pathology. Aging alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain is often underestimated and undertreated, and treatment must be individualized and adapted according to the patient's health status, including comorbidities and chronic treatments.

### Acute Pain

- Certain acute conditions that are typically painful in adults, such as myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, and fractures, can be ""silent"" in the elderly. They often present late at the emergency department and report their pain later than younger adults, leading to more complications that can be serious or even fatal.

### Chronic Pain

- The prevalence of chronic pain is high, affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions. It has various aetiologies, including osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, and iatrogenic causes.

### Pain Management

Pain management is based on four pillars: Spotting, Evaluation, Treatment, and Revaluation.

#### Spotting

- Some types of pain are predictable, such as pain during care or pressure sores, while others are more difficult to anticipate, like paroxysmal attacks of pain. It is important to look for warning signs and have a pain reflex, especially if the behavior is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming. Any elderly person expressing pain or behavior suggestive of pain should be considered in pain, and the precautionary principle should be applied.

#### Evaluation

- The patient should be correctly seated, with an empathetic and patient approach, fostering a climate of trust while considering any cognitive or expressive difficulties. A geriatric assessment, including depression and behavior, is conducted alongside identifying pain components. Self-assessment is done using a simple numerical or verbal scale. If this fails, an observation of behaviors using a hetero-evaluation scale (e.g., Algoplus®, Doloplus®, ECPA®) is used, preferably in a team, and repeated regularly.

#### Treatment

- Aging modifies the pharmacology of drugs, including analgesics. The same analgesics and co-analgesics used by younger adults are used, but adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous due to comorbidities and polymedication. Clinical pharmacists can help screen for drug-related iatrogenia and assist in drug reconciliation. Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexist in the elderly. Before prescribing analgesics, the patient's health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation, and compliance must be assessed. Dosage adjustments are recommended, with dosages increased slowly, and renal function monitored. Potential adverse effects and interactions of added analgesics are anticipated and avoided, but pain should not be undertreated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred. It is recommended to combine analgesics with non-pharmacological techniques, adapted to the sensory deficits caused by aging.

#### Revaluation

- Always reassess to adapt and prioritize treatments to reduce multi-medication and optimize the benefit-risk balance. An elderly patient who does not complain can still be in pain.",1.0,6.010000000000002,False,True,0.7915846109390259,0.0,a,False,3,3

The benefits of regular physical activity for patients suffering from a chronic disease are described in the document ""Connaître les effets positifs de l'activité physique dans les maladies chroniques et savoir les expliquer au patient"" (2C-249-PC-A01, source HAS).

In patients with no chronic pathology, sport has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of all these chronic physical and mental pathologies. By improving patients' physical condition and developing their social interactions, sporting activities help to prevent the onset of these chronic pathologies, increase overall life expectancy, and improve the quality of life of patients of all ages (see item 248).

In children, daily physical activity is necessary for the development and improvement of motor and physical skills. Practising sport has beneficial effects on mental health (increased self-esteem, reduced anxiety) and physical health (prevention of obesity, metabolic syndrome). Moreover, an individual who takes part in sporting activities as a child is more likely to do so as an adult. Physical activity in childhood therefore partly determines the health of future adults. Involving children in competitions allows them to develop their social interactions and to test themselves against others, serving as a vehicle for motivation and progress.

At any age, the risks of practising sport include:

- Mainly cardiovascular: While regular physical activity has been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular risk is transiently increased during intense physical exercise (increased cardiac output and arterial pressure during exercise), compared with the situation at rest. This is why the main contraindications to practising sport are cardiovascular, and why the medical examination for the absence of contraindications to practising sport focuses on the cardiovascular system.

## Definitions

Atelectasis is a collapse of the lung parenchyma, affecting a segment, a lobe, or the entire lung.

Atelectasis is most often of bronchial origin, secondary to endo-luminal, mural, or extrinsic obstruction of a bronchus, usually of large diameter. It can also be passive (pulmonary collapse due to pleural effusion or ascension of the diaphragmatic dome) or due to coiling (secondary to pleural thickening).

Atelectasis of bronchial origin is manifested on chest X-ray by direct and indirect signs.

### Direct Sign

- Opacity corresponding to a retracted lung, with a reduction in volume of the affected area. This opacity is systematized with sharp edges. In lobar atelectasis, the shape of the opacity varies according to the lobe affected, but is most often triangular with a hilar apex.
- No aeriform bronchogram.

### Indirect Signs

- Scissural displacement, becoming concave towards the healthy parenchyma.
- Attraction of adjacent anatomical structures such as the trachea, heart, and hilum.
- Ascension of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome.
- Possible compensatory hyperinflation of adjacent territories.

Chest X-rays are frequently used to detect atelectasis of bronchial origin. A profile X-ray, in addition to a frontal X-ray, is often used to confirm and localize atelectasis. A thoracic CT scan is indicated to specify the site of the obstruction (endoluminal, wall, or extrinsic) and its nature (foreign body, tumor, etc.).

### Example of Parenchymal Atelectasis on Chest X-ray

1. **Figure 1**: Diffuse homogeneous opacity of the left lung field, without aeriform bronchogram, associated with left tracheal deviation and ascension of the left diaphragmatic dome on chest radiograph. Mediastinal deviation secondary to atelectasis of the left lung, with evidence of an endoluminal lesion of the left main bronchus on chest CT with contrast injection. Primary bronchial tumor.

2. **Figure 2**: Homogeneous systematized retrocardiac opacity of the left lower lobe on chest radiograph, roughly triangular in shape with hilar apex. Left deviation of the cardiac silhouette. Corresponding paravertebral opacity showing complete atelectasis of the left lower lobe.

3. **Figure 3**: Systematized homogeneous opacity of the right upper lobe with displacement of the small scissure, ascending.

**Definitions and Concept of Nociceptive Pain**

- Nociceptive pain, or pain caused by an excess of nociception, serves as a useful alarm signal in the acute phase. It provides information about a stimulus—injury or aggression—that threatens tissue integrity.

- These pains are generally acute and sometimes associated with neuropathic phenomena, referred to as mixed pain (e.g., cancer pain).

- They are frequent and still too often outsourced.

- Treatment focuses not only on the intensity but also on the etiology.

**Main Etiologies of Nociceptive Pain**

- Traumatic and/or intra- and post-operative pain: This is not directly correlated with the extent of tissue damage and varies from one individual to another. Intra-operative pain is prevented by anesthesia (general or loco-regional), while post-operative pain requires an analgesic strategy.

- Inflammatory pain is often acute, as in renal colic (due to distension and inflammatory reaction of the urinary tract upstream of an obstacle) or tissue infection, or more prolonged, as in arthritis flare-ups in the context of chronic joint damage (rheumatoid arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, gout).

- Mechanical pain, linked to movement, occurs either when walking in a context of osteoarthritis, spinal joint overload (cervicalgia, dorsalgia, lumbago), during prolonged joint stress, or during certain treatments, particularly physiotherapy.

- Pain of cancer.

- Pain induced by treatment.

**Diagnosis and Main Features**

- Unlike neuropathic pain, nociceptive pain does not necessarily have a specific symptomatology.

- They are generally located opposite the lesion and may be associated with inflammatory signs, particularly in the event of acute pain or acute painful flare-ups of a chronic pathology (e.g., osteoarthritis flare-ups).",1.0,9.655000000000001,False,True,0.7772087454795837,0.0,a,False,2,4

A medical certificate stating that you have no contraindications to practising sport is required:

- To obtain or renew a federal sports licence
- To take part in a sports competition if the patient is not a member of a sports federation

This medical certificate must be less than one year old on the day of application for the federal licence or registration for the competition.

Any medical doctor can draw up this certificate, which states that there are no contraindications to practising the sport, in competition where applicable, and mentions the contraindicated discipline(s) where appropriate.

If a sports patient renews their licence with the same federation from one year to the next, the medical certificate is only required every three years. During the two intervening years, the athlete can obtain a licence by certifying to his or her federation that he or she has answered NO to each of the sections of the ""QS-SPORT"" health questionnaire available online.

Certain sports involving special constraints (mountaineering, underwater diving, speleology, combat sports with knockouts, sports using firearms, sports using motor vehicles, sports using aircraft, rugby with 15, 13 or 7 players) require specific medical examinations (cardiological, ENT, dental, neurological, ophthalmological, cervical spine, etc.).

**Description:** Savoir expliquer la prescription d'un médicament générique ou d'un biosimilaire  
**Rubric:** Prescribing  

== Generic Drug ==  
A generic drug is a drug for which the patent on the active ingredient has expired and is therefore in the public domain. It can be freely produced by a pharmaceutical laboratory, provided it has the same qualitative and quantitative composition of active ingredients as the originator drug. It must also have the same pharmaceutical form (tablet, capsule, oral solution, etc.) and demonstrate identical pharmacokinetic characteristics to the originator, as shown in a bioequivalence study. Generic medicines may contain different excipients from the originator. Notable excipients are listed to help prescribers decide whether to replace an originator drug with a generic drug. The appearance, color, and taste of a generic drug may differ from the originator drug. In most cases, the generic drug is identified by the international non-proprietary name (INN), the name of the laboratory, the strength, and the pharmaceutical form of the drug. Substituting a generic drug for an originator drug serves the economic purpose of controlling healthcare costs.

== Authorisation of Generic Medicinal Products ==  
Generic medicines have a simplified marketing authorisation (MA) procedure. Marketing authorisation for these medicines is obtained for the indication of the originator medicine based on the pharmaceutical dossier and bioequivalence studies. These studies must be randomised, cross-over, and single-dose. Bioequivalence is achieved if the 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean of the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the generic drug are within the range of 80-125% of those of the originator drug. For medicines with a narrow therapeutic margin, the acceptance margin in bioequivalence studies is reduced to an interval of 90-111%.

== Substitution of a Generic Drug ==  
Generic drugs are listed in the generics register in groups containing the reference drug and the various authorised generic drugs. Substitutions of medicines are only possible within the same generic group. Substitutions may be made between the reference drug and a drug in the generic group, or between generic drugs.

Prescriptions must be in INN, and the prescribing doctor or the pharmacist dispensing the medicine is authorised to substitute a medicine with a generic. The prescriber and/or pharmacist making the substitution must consider the presence of excipients with a known effect when making the substitution:

- If the medicinal product to be substituted does not contain an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic product that does not contain such an excipient should be prescribed/dispensed in preference.
- If the medicinal product to be substituted contains an excipient with a notorious effect, a generic containing the same excipient or a generic without such an excipient should be prescribed/dispensed.

== Refusal to Substitute ==  
Under specific conditions requiring medical justification, the prescribing doctor may refuse to allow a generic drug to be substituted for a prescription. In this case, ""non-substitutable"" must be written on the prescription. This objection to substitution is only possible in three situations:

- Prescription in children under 6 years of age when there is no suitable galenic form.
- Prescription in a patient with a contraindication to an excipient of the generic medicinal product if this excipient is present in all the specialities of the generic group and is not present in the composition of the originator.
- Prescription of a medicinal product with a narrow therapeutic margin, the list of which is defined by decree, in a patient whose treatment with this medicinal product is balanced.

Pharmacists are authorised to substitute a drug with a generic from the same group if the drug is not labelled ""non-substitutable"" and if this substitution does not result in additional costs for the health insurance scheme.

== Biosimilar Medicinal Product ==  
A biosimilar medicinal product is a biological medicinal product (involving a biological source, protein, or cell, for their production) with the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as a reference biological medicinal product which has obtained marketing authorisation. The biological nature, complexity of the molecule, and difficulty in producing these medicines mean that this type of medicine does not meet the conditions for being considered a generic medicine.

== Authorisation of Biosimilar Medicinal Products ==  
Biosimilar medicinal products require additional preclinical and clinical pharmacodynamic and toxicological data proving comparability in terms of pharmacological mode of action, efficacy, and clinical safety. As these are biological medicinal products, it is also essential to study their immunogenicity.

If a biosimilar medicinal product demonstrates, in an indication deemed to be representative, comparable efficacy and a comparable safety profile to a reference biological medicinal product, this biosimilar medicinal product may obtain, by extrapolation, authorisation for the other indications approved for the reference biological medicinal product (e.g., marketing authorisation for biosimilars of anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha in all the indications of the reference biological medicinal product after demonstration of its efficacy and safety in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis).

== Interchangeability of Biosimilar Medicinal Products ==  
By definition, a biosimilar medicinal product cannot be substituted in the same way as a generic medicinal product, since it is not an exact copy of the reference medicinal product. However, these biosimilar medicines are 'interchangeable' at the prescriber's initiative. This interchangeability is possible at any time during a patient's treatment but requires informing the patient and obtaining their consent, recording the change to a biosimilar in the patient's file, and ensuring appropriate monitoring after the change to the biosimilar.",1.0,9.44923076923077,False,True,0.7260512709617615,0.0,d,False,2,4

- This definition is accompanied by the following comments:

  - Pain is always a personal experience influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, social, and environmental factors.

  - Pain and nociception are two distinct phenomena. The presence of pain cannot be deduced solely from the activity of sensory neurons.

  - Over the course of their lives, individuals learn the concept of pain. (Refers to the notion of pain as a ""learned"" or conditioned concept)

  - Although pain can play an adaptive role, it can also have deleterious effects on social and psychological function and well-being.

Typical HUS is characterized by a combination of acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia, and thrombocytopenia following food contamination that causes bloody diarrhoea. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolating the STEC strain (shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli) or through PCR detection of shigatoxin-encoding genes in stools.

Atypical HUS occurs more frequently in adults, without diarrhoea, and is most often linked to an acquired or genetic abnormality of the complement pathway. It often recurs, particularly after renal transplantation, and has a more severe prognosis.

**Description:** To understand the concept of differential selection, differential and non-differential classification bias. Anticipate and master the specifics of bias depending on the study design. Know how to limit these biases.  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Selection and Ranking Biases**

Selection and ranking biases can be:

- **Non-differential**: The risk of bias is identical in each of the groups studied (defined by the exposure factor or endpoint of interest). This type of bias results in a loss of power, i.e., it tends to bias the results of the study in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference.
- **Differential**: The risk of bias differs according to the group studied (defined by the exposure factor or the endpoint of interest). This type of bias can influence the outcome of the study either in favor of the null hypothesis of no difference or in favor of the alternative hypothesis of the presence of a difference.

**Selection Bias**

- **Nondifferential**: Occurs when the study population is not a representative sample of the population of interest, which will pose problems of external validity.
- **Differential**: Occurs if the way patients are selected differs between the study groups. Randomization prevents initial differential selection bias. However, during follow-up, patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw their consent for one of the exposure groups or for the risk of the event of interest will result in a differential selection bias. To minimize these biases, it is necessary to ensure that the selection and follow-up of subjects are as independent of the exposure group and event risk as possible.

**Classification Bias**

- **Nondifferential**: Occurs when the classification error on the judgment criterion (respectively on the exposure) occurs with the same probability in exposed and unexposed people (respectively according to the judgment criterion). It produces an underestimate of the association, in other words, bringing the value of the RR or OR closer to 1.
- **Differential**: Occurs if the way in which the data are collected (whether exposure or judgment criterion) differs according to the group (exposure or judgment criterion). In clinical trials, blinding prevents these biases; in observational studies, it is a major risk. In particular, in case-control studies, the classic example is exposure recall bias: cases remember more or make more effort to seek out information about their exposure, whereas this is often under-reported by controls. Generally speaking, these biases can be limited by using data collection procedures that are as standardized and objective as possible, and that are similar for all subjects included in the study.",0.75,18.736363636363638,False,True,0.701061487197876,0.0,a,False,2,4

**Rubric:** Definition  

Deep vein thrombosis can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are two main possible mechanisms: valve destruction, which causes reflux, and/or residual venous obstruction. This results in signs of venous insufficiency, which may even lead to venous claudication.

The severity of PTS depends on the extent of venous dysfunction resulting from the sequelae of post-thrombotic syndrome (valvular destruction, residual venous obstruction, and venous reflux). Its severity is assessed using the Villalta score, which is based on subjective and objective clinical signs of venous insufficiency.

**Evaluation of the Severity of Post-Thrombotic Syndrome Using the Villalta Score**

- **Subjective Symptoms (Patient):**
  - Heaviness
  - Pain
  - Cramps
  - Pruritus

- **Objective Signs (Doctor):**
  - Oedema
  - Calf pressure pain
  - Induration of the skin
  - Hyperpigmentation
  - Redness

For each symptom or sign, points are awarded:  
0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe

- Score 5-9: Moderate SPT
- Score 10-14: Intermediate SPT

  - PCO2 (mmHg): 42 - 50
  - HCO3- (mmol/L): 23 - 27

**Analysis of a Blood Gas Result**

1. **Acidosis or Alkalosis?**
   - Acidaemia (or decompensated acidosis): arterial pH < 7.38 or venous pH < 7.32.
   - Alkalaemia (or decompensated alkalosis): arterial pH > 7.42 or venous pH > 7.38.

   Note: A pH abnormality is not necessary to diagnose an acid-base disorder. For example, a low bicarbonate level with a normal pH may correspond to metabolic acidosis associated with respiratory alkalosis.

2. **Metabolic or Respiratory?**
   - Primary PCO2 abnormalities: acidosis (high PCO2) or alkalosis (low PCO2) known as ""respiratory"".
   - Primary HCO3- abnormalities: so-called ""metabolic"" acidosis (HCO3- low) or alkalosis (HCO3- high).

3. **Compensatory Renal or Respiratory Responses**

**Definitions**

Allergic contact dermatitis is an allergic hypersensitivity specific to a given antigen (called an ""allergen""). It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification. The Type IV delayed hypersensitivity is illustrated in the Gel and Coombs classification.

**Pathophysiological Phases**

1. **Asymptomatic Sensitisation Phase:** In non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to naïve LTCD8+. The naïve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.

2. **Symptomatic Phase (Allergic Contact Dermatitis):** When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction. This is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis). It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Emergency Identification  

In the event of a decrease in visual acuity with a white, painless eye, a fundus examination guides the diagnosis and treatment.

1. **Fundus Not Visible or Poorly Visible:** Intravitreal haemorrhage.  
   The cause of the haemorrhage is easy to recognize when the retina remains visible. A massive haemorrhage renders the retina invisible on fundus examination. If the retina is not visible, B-ultrasound should be performed to rule out retinal detachment.  
   The main causes of intravitreal haemorrhage are as follows:
   - Proliferative diabetic retinopathy
   - Occlusions of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - Retinal tearing, whether or not complicated by retinal detachment
   - Terson's syndrome: Uni- or bilateral intravitreal haemorrhage associated with meningeal haemorrhage due to rupture of an intracranial aneurysm (Terson's syndrome may also be associated with meningeal haemorrhage of traumatic origin).

2. **Clearly Visible and Abnormal Fundus:**  
   - Occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches: This is a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and, as such, the patient should be admitted urgently to a neurovascular unit to prevent another life-threatening vascular event. It should look for carotid atheroma and embologenic heart disease. In a young patient, a carotid dissection should also be sought.
   - Occlusion of the central retinal vein or one of its branches
   - AMD complicated by macular choroidal neovessels: This requires rapid initiation (within a few days of diagnosis) of treatment with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF.
   - Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD): The spontaneous evolution is very negative, with the detached retina suffering irreversible damage within a few weeks. A recent RD is a surgical ""semi-emergency"", justifying an operation within a few days of diagnosis, often less than a week when the macula is detached and even more urgent when the macula is still flat.
   - Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA): This must be ruled out as an emergency.

**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Etiologies  

== Optic Nerve Damage ==

=== Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy (NOIA) ===

NOIA is caused by acute ischaemia of the optic nerve head due to occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) or their branches. It is characterized by a sudden unilateral drop in visual acuity, associated with papilledema and visual field damage, typically in the form of an altitudinal deficit.

Horton's disease or gigantocellular arteritis (also known as arteritic optic neuropathy) should be considered first due to the need for systemic corticosteroids to be administered urgently. A systematic search should be made for evidence of Horton's disease: systemic signs of the disease, changes in the temporal arteries, suggestive ocular signs (episodes of fleeting amaurosis preceding the onset of NOIA, choroidal filling defect on fundus angiography indicative of choroidal ischaemia), biological signs (accelerated sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein), and temporal artery biopsy (should be performed as soon as possible, but there is no reason to wait for it before starting corticosteroid therapy). The risk of bilateralization and complete, bilateral, permanent blindness means that any suspected case of Horton's disease must be treated with high-dose corticosteroids urgently.

Arteriosclerosis (also known as non-arteritic optic neuropathy) is the most common cause of NOIA, due to occlusion of the PCAs or one of their branches by in situ thrombosis. Risk factors generally include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

The differential diagnosis includes other causes of papilledema.

=== Papilledema ===

This is a swelling of the optic nerve head following an increase in intracranial pressure. In the presence of papilledema, malignant arterial hypertension (if bilateral) and intracranial hypertension (if bilateral) should be ruled out, followed by inflammatory optic neuropathy.

Symptoms of intracranial hypertension include headache, nausea/vomiting, transient visual disturbances such as visual eclipses, and VI nerve paralysis. Initially, there is no loss of visual acuity and no visual field abnormalities other than enlargement of blind spots.

In cases of inflammatory optic neuritis with papillitis, visual acuity is predominantly impaired.

=== Retro-bulbar Optic Neuritis (RBON) ===

Damage is often rapidly progressive (over a few hours to a few days) and can cause a drop in visual acuity of varying severity. This is associated with the appearance of a scotoma, usually central or caecocentral. Visual impairment is often accompanied by retro-orbital pain, which increases when the eyeballs are moved. Retrobulbar optic neuritis should be investigated first and foremost for multiple sclerosis, which is the main cause, particularly in young patients.

Other causes of optic nerve damage include:

- Toxic and drug-induced optic neuropathies: These neuropathies are bilateral and progressive. They are dominated by four causes: ethylic optic neuropathy, optic neuropathies related to anti-tuberculosis treatments (ethambutol and isoniazid), occupational optic neuropathies (e.g., lead), and metabolic optic neuropathies (diabetes).

- Tumoral optic neuropathies, linked to intra-orbital tumors or tumors in the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).

== Damage to the Optic Chiasm ==

Compression of the optic pathways at the level of the chiasma results in a very specific aspect of the visual field known as ""chiasmatic syndrome,"" which, in its typical form, results in a bitemporal hemianopia, i.e., a deficit in the temporal hemifields (corresponding to damage to the nasal fibers which decussate at the level of the chiasma). Sometimes the compression is partial (particularly in the early stages) and a bitemporal quadranopsia is observed.

In terms of aetiology, the main cause of chiasmatic syndrome is pituitary adenoma. Chiasmatic syndrome is often progressive in onset, beginning with superior bitemporal quadranopsia.

== Retrochiasmatic Disease ==

This results in a sensory deficit in one hemifield, right or left (the same on both sides), called homonymous lateral hemianopia, with the deficit on the opposite side to the lesion. Damage to the optic radiations, where the upper and lower fibers travel in two clearly separated bundles, is more likely to result in homonymous lateral quadranopsia, usually superior.

In terms of aetiology, there are three main causes: vascular (stroke, compressive hematoma), tumor, and trauma.

A sudden onset of hemianopsia or homonymous lateral quadranopsia caused by damage to the retrochiasmatic optic pathways suggests a vascular etiology, whereas a progressive onset suggests a tumor etiology.",0.0,6.2755555555555596,False,True,0.7492263317108154,0.0,b,False,2,4

**Description:** Understanding the sources of funding for social protection.

Social security contributions are compulsory payments made by self-employed persons, employees, and employers to acquire entitlement to social security benefits. These contributions cover health, maternity, disability, and death insurance; old age insurance; unemployment insurance; and family allowances. There is also the ""contribution solidarité autonomie"" (CSA, or solidarity day) payable by public and private employers who are liable for the employer's health insurance contribution.

Social security contributions account for the bulk of social protection resources. However, since 1990, the proportion of social security contributions in social welfare funding has been declining in favor of fiscal resources, such as the CSG (general social contribution), and exemptions on employers' contributions. Earmarked taxes account for a growing proportion of social protection resources. They include:

- Transfers of tax resources paid on a permanent basis to social security schemes (particularly the farmers' scheme).
- Taxes on products (e.g., taxes on alcohol, tobacco, motor insurance).
- Taxes on wages and labor.
- Taxes on income and wealth, which is the largest proportion of social protection tax resources. They include the CSG and the contribution to the repayment of the social debt (CRDS).

State public contributions finance solidarity spending (RSA, old age solidarity fund), part of the exemptions from employer contributions, and subsidize schemes.

The origin of social protection resources, particularly in pension schemes where the number of active contributors is less than the number of pensioners, is illustrated in a graph. The breakdown of social protection resources by type of levy in 2020 shows a decline in the share of social contributions due to the drop in professional activity during 2020 (confinements). This highlights the importance of economic activity in generating financial resources for social protection.

Nutritional advice must be adapted to cultural, ethnic, and family traditions, as well as to professional constraints, and is inseparable from the action of insulin therapy. Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, and education of a type 1 diabetic patient (SD-280).

Carbohydrate intake is defined for each patient based on weight, eating habits, glycaemic profile, and insulin regimen.

The diet should be varied and divided into three main meals, supplemented if necessary by one or two snacks. Snacks are essential during intense physical activity.

The main aim of dietetics in type 1 diabetes is to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood sugar levels, either through the consumption of products with a high glycaemic index or through an inadequate intake of carbohydrates at meals or during physical exercise, which could lead to hypoglycaemia (SD-209) or hyperglycaemia (SD-208).

Patients must learn to take sugar again in the event of hypoglycaemia.

Regular physical activity promotes a better metabolic balance. It requires education to avoid hypo- and hyperglycaemia at the time of sport and/or afterwards. A clinical assessment is necessary when resuming an activity after a long period of inactivity.

Diabetes can cause personal and family distress. Psychological support can improve metabolic control.

The Higham score is used to assess menorrhagia severity.

**Superficial Urticaria**

The primary lesion is an edematous papule, erythematous with a clear border and sometimes a lighter center. There is no particular topography. The shape and size of the papules may vary; there may be annular or polycyclic lesions, and the papules may range from a few millimeters to large, geographically-contoured plaques. The three major characteristics of these edematous papules in superficial urticaria are their ""pruriginous, fleeting, and migratory"" nature.

**Deep Urticaria or Angioedema**

The primary lesion is a firm, non-itchy, pinkish-white edema with a sensation of tension or pain. This edema is transient, receding within 72 hours without scarring, and most often occurs in areas rich in mast cells: the face, extremities, and external genitalia. In the case of anaphylaxis, the edema may be of laryngeal or pharyngeal origin, which may affect the prognosis.

**Definitions**

Migraine with aura is an independent risk factor for cerebral infarction. The risk is doubled in a person suffering from migraine with aura and increases with cofactors such as female sex, age under 45, smoking, and oestroprogestogenic contraception.

**In Practice:** Before prescribing oral contraception, systematically check for migraine and determine whether it is without aura or with aura. Then, assess all arterial risk factors:

- Age > 35
- Smoking
- Family history of stroke or myocardial infarction
- Hypertension (SD-042)
- Dyslipidaemia
- Obesity

**Contraception Choice According to Vascular Risk Factors and Type of Migraine**

**Migraine Without Aura**

- Absence of any arterial risk factor: All types of contraception are possible, including oestroprogestins.
- If one or more arterial risk factors are present: Oestroprogestogenic oral contraceptives are contraindicated; pure progestogens are possible, as are other methods of contraception.

- Treatment is aetiological (discontinuation of medication, treatment of diabetes mellitus), preventive (especially in patients who do not have free access to water), and symptomatic.
- In the case of acute symptomatic hypernatremia in adults, the initial rate of correction should be 2 mmol/L/h (without exceeding 10-12 mmol/L/d).
- When hypernatremia has been present for a long time, the rate of correction should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h, i.e., 10-12 mmol/L/24h, to avoid inducing cerebral oedema and convulsions.
- The amount of water to be administered can be estimated using the following formula: Water deficit = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).
- Water can be administered in the form of:
  - Drinking water orally or via a gastric tube
  - 5% glucose solution (50 g per L) or 2.5% glucose solution (25 g per L) intravenously

**Description:** Definition of the different types of spa treatment and how they work  
**Rubric:** Definition  

Every year, almost 600,000 patients undergo a spa treatment in France.

== Definitions of a Spa Treatment ==  
All therapies applied to a patient during their stay in a spa, including crenotherapy, rest, a change of scenery, climate, and possibly non-thermal treatments (functional rehabilitation, therapeutic education). Do not confuse thermal medicine with hydrotherapy (external use of any water, regardless of its physical or chemical composition) or thalassotherapy (use of seawater without systematic medical supervision; neither recognized nor reimbursed by Health Insurance) or Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine.

== Waters Used in Thermal Medicine ==  
They are classified according to their temperature (thermality) and their chemical composition (minerality). The ""thermality"" separates ""cold"" waters (8 to 15°C, mainly for diuresis cures), ""mesothermal"" waters (25 to 34°C, for prolonged baths), and ""hyperthermal"" waters (inhalation, study, shower, bath). The ""mineralization"" (presence of a predominant ion) is constant for each source and enables mineral waters to be classified as:

- **Sulphur:** H2S, especially respiratory indications: sodic of the ""Pyrenean"" type or calcic
- **Sulphate:** Urinary and metabolic diseases, especially calcium and magnesium
- **Sodic Chlorides:** Rich in sodium
- **Gas Carbonates:** Sodium or calcium
- **With a Rare Element:** Arsenic, iron, copper, selenium
- **Low Mineral Content:** Trace metals

Note: Mineral waters are unstable, losing their characteristics after a few hours, which is why it is necessary to take the water from the source (""griffon"") and to carry out the treatment on site. Other thermal agents include thermal plankton, thermal gases (CO2, H2S), and mud (peloids).

== Thermal Techniques with Three Main Types of Cures ==  

1. **Internal Hydrotherapy:** Based on drinking cures (taking 100 to 300 ml/day of thermal water) used in all resorts. Diuresis cures (up to 3 liters per day) are used for digestive, urinary, or metabolic disorders.
2. **Contact Cures:** Application of the thermal agent in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. For respiratory ailments: inhalations, aerosols, balneotherapy, nasal baths, sinus cleansing, etc.
3. **External Hydrotherapy:** Uses the physical characteristics of water: baths (in a pool or bathtub, hot or warm), showers (local, regional, or general, of varying temperature, pressure, and duration) for sedative or analgesic purposes, hand or foot baths.

Other thermal techniques include functional re-education, treatments not specific to thermal medicine (physiotherapy, postural drainage, and respiratory re-education), and health education, for which thermal cures are an ideal place.

== Spa Resorts in France ==  
Around a hundred spa resorts in France: firstly in Occitanie (200,000 spa visitors/year), then in Nouvelle Aquitaine (150,000 spa visitors/year) and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (130,000 spa visitors/year). The three main resorts are Balaruc (RH, PHL), Dax (RH, PHL), and Gréoux (RH, VR).

== Indications for Spa Treatment ==  
Chronic pathologies, incompletely improved. The majority of cures are for rheumatology (3/4), followed by the respiratory tract (1/10) and phlebology (1/20). One of the characteristics is the specialization in the treatment of certain conditions (due to the principle of the specificity of mineral waters). There are 12 therapeutic orientations for spas recognized by the French social security system, and spas may have two (exceptionally three) therapeutic orientations.

- **RH:** Rheumatology and sequelae of osteo-articular trauma
- **Respiratory Tract Diseases:** ENT or pneumology
- **MCA:** Cardio-Arterial Diseases
- **AU:** Diseases of the Urinary System and Metabolic Diseases
- **AD:** Diseases of the Digestive System and Metabolic Diseases
- **PHL:** Phlebology
- **GYN:** Gynaecology
- **DER:** Dermatology
- **AMB:** Oral and lingual mucosal diseases
- **NEU:** Neurology
- **PSY:** Psychosomatic disorders
- **TDE:** Troubles du Développement de l'Enfant (Anomaly of psychomotor development)

Since the early 2000s, under the aegis of the AFRETH (Association Française de REcherche THermale - French Association for Thermal Research), several high-quality clinical trials have been carried out, demonstrating the clinical effectiveness of thermal medicine in its main indications. The most validated indications are rheumatology (osteoarthritis, chronic lumbago, inflammatory rheumatism outside flare-ups), followed by arteritis and psychiatry (generalized anxiety disorders).

== Undesirable Effects of Spa Treatments ==  
Very rare and often ""non-serious"": asthenia after a few days of treatment (""spa crisis""), complications of treatment techniques, etc.

== Contraindications to Spa Treatments ==  
Obvious non-indications such as infections, cancers, relapsing illnesses, recent cardiovascular diseases, immunodepression, etc.

== How to Prescribe a Spa Treatment ==  
The cure is prescribed by the attending physician on a special form to be sent to the Caisse d'AM with its two sections: prise en charge (completed by the prescribing physician) and déclaration de ressources (completed by the insured person). The doctor must specify (using the key letter) the main indication (and any secondary indications). A course of treatment lasts three weeks. Reimbursed at 65% by SS (100% reimbursed if ALD, occupational disease, or work accident). Complementary medical practices (pharyngeal showers, Proetz displacement method in ENT, thermal gas injections for arteriopathy) are reimbursed at 70%.

The medical surveillance package includes three medical consultations: on arrival, in the middle, and at the end of the cure. Only one cure per year is reimbursed by Social Security. You can renew your spa treatment every year.",0.4,6.936363636363637,False,True,0.7158571481704712,0.0,a,False,1,1

**Title:** Knowing the definition of the different techniques of medically assisted procreation (MAP)  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Definition  

**Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) Techniques Include:**

- **Intra-Uterine Insemination (IUI):** Also known as artificial insemination (AI), this technique involves depositing selected spermatozoa in the uterus at the most opportune moment. It can be performed with sperm from a spouse (IAC) or from a donor (IAD). Insemination is ideally preceded by stimulation of follicular growth with gonadotropins (FSH or FSH+LH) to mature one to three follicles or induce ovulation for patients with menstrual cycle disorders (Abnormal genital bleeding (SD-112)). Pelvic ultrasound scans and hormone assays are necessary to monitor the ovarian response to stimulation, known as ovulation monitoring. Ovulation is triggered by an injection of recombinant hCG to synchronize ovulation (occurring 36 hours after triggering) and intrauterine sperm deposition. The day after induction, sperm is collected by masturbation in a specifically approved MAP laboratory under satisfactory aseptic conditions. Mobile spermatozoa are selected and inseminated into the uterine cavity using a suitable catheter.

- **In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF):** Conventional or assisted fertilisation with intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is carried out in several stages.

  - **Ovarian Stimulation:** Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is achieved by administering high doses of exogenous gonadotropins (FSH alone or FSH + LH by subcutaneous injection). To prevent spontaneous premature ovulation, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is blocked by administering GnRH agonists or antagonists. Ovulation monitoring using pelvic ultrasound (follicular growth and endometrial thickness) and hormone monitoring (estradiol, LH, and progesterone levels) is required to:
    - Check the effectiveness of the stimulation (number of follicles growing).
    - Choose the optimum day for ovulation induction.
    - Identify situations where there is a risk of complications (e.g., ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome) or failure (e.g., insufficient ovarian response).

  - **Follicular Puncture:** Performed in the operating theatre (36 hours after ovulation is triggered), under local or general anesthetic, vaginally under ultrasound control. The follicular fluid is sent immediately to the laboratory for examination of cumulo-oocyte complexes.

  - **Sperm Preparation:** Typically involves a sperm sample taken by masturbation on the day of the follicular puncture. Frozen sperm from a spouse or third-party donor can also be used. Sperm taken surgically (from testicular tissue or epididymal liquid) in cases of azoospermia can be used fresh or after freezing. Sperm can also be recovered from alkalinized urine in cases of retrograde ejaculation. The recovered spermatozoa are prepared according to the ""in vitro"" fertilisation technique envisaged.

  - **Fertilisation:** Either conventional or classic (IVF-c) with the recovered oocytes brought into contact with prepared spermatozoa, or with intracytoplasmic sperm microinjection (ICSI).

  - **Culture and Embryo Transfer:** After fertilisation, the embryos obtained are cultured. One or two embryos can be transferred to the uterus after 2 to 6 days of culture. The choice of the number of embryos and the day of transfer depends on various factors. A pregnancy blood test is carried out approximately 14 days after the puncture.

  - **Embryo Freezing:** Non-transferred embryos with adequate development can be frozen using cryoprotectants and stored in liquid nitrogen (-196°C) in reproductive biology laboratories. When frozen embryos are used, they are thawed and transferred to the uterus, which has been prepared using various protocols.

**Types of MPA:**

- **Intra-Marital:** Using the gametes, oocytes, and spermatozoa of both members of the couple.

  - Hyperthermia fever
  - Joint pain
  - Limb pain
  - Spinal pain (cervical, dorsal, lumbar)

  - Prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  - Assessment and management of acute pain
  - Assessment and management of chronic pain
  - Assessment and management of pain in children and infants

- **In connection with contraindications:**

  - Normal pregnancy follow-up consultations (1st trimester, 2nd trimester, and 3rd trimester)

- **In connection with adverse reactions:**
  - Abdominal pain
  - Release of blood through the mouth
  - Arterial hypertension
  - Localised or diffuse oedema
  - Acute haemorrhage
  - Abnormal erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit)
  - Fall in haemoglobin

- **In connection with precautions for use:**
  - Adapting treatments for specific conditions (renal failure, liver failure, pregnancy, the elderly, etc.)
  - Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a patient with a history of cardiovascular disease
  - Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for patients with heart failure
  - Monitoring patients with chronic renal failure
  - Geriatric follow-up consultations
  - Suspicion of an adverse reaction to medication or treatment

### Mechanism of Action
- Analgesic (low dose), antipyretic (low dose), and anti-inflammatory (higher dose) properties
- Reducing prostanoid production by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) with two isoenzymes:
  - Cox-1, constitutive in almost all tissues, catalyses the formation of prostaglandins involved in the cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa and the preservation of renal function, as well as the production of thromboxane A₂ (TxA₂, vasoconstrictive and proaggregant) by platelets.
  - Cox-2, essentially an isoenzyme that is inducible in inflammatory states, leads to the release of prostaglandins with a pathological role (fever, pain, inflammation, cell proliferation), but also a beneficial role in various processes (wound healing, renal function, ovulation, etc.) and governing the synthesis of prostacyclin (PGI₂), a vasodilator and antiaggregant, by endothelial cells.
- Non-selective NSAIDs inhibit Cox-1 and Cox-2 more or less selectively. Cox-2 selective NSAIDs or coxibs exert a preferential inhibition of Cox-2.
- NSAIDs marketed as low-dose, over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics
- Hence the undesirable effects of NSAIDs, centred on digestive, renal, and cardiac complications.

### Indications
- Fever: low dose
- Pain:
  - Acute pain: dental pain, postoperative pain, post-traumatic pain, headaches or migraines, renal colic, ENT pathology, etc.
  - Chronic pain: degenerative rheumatological conditions (joint pain, spinal pain), neoplastic pain.
- Inflammation: higher dosage
  - Acute microcrystalline attacks (gout, chondrocalcinosis), abarticular pathologies, spinal pain, and radicular pain and chronic inflammatory rheumatism.
- Non-listed NSAIDs: low-dose NSAIDs, over-the-counter, symptomatic treatment of painful or febrile conditions.

### Contraindications
- Known allergy to the drug or related molecules.
- Active peptic ulcer and history of peptic ulcer or recurrent haemorrhage (at least two documented episodes).
- Asthma to aspirin and cross-allergy to other NSAIDs (Fernand-Vidal syndrome).
- Renal insufficiency, severe hepatocellular insufficiency, severe cardiac insufficiency.
- Pregnancy (from the 6th month for NSAIDs and throughout pregnancy for coxibs) and breast-feeding.
- Haemorrhagic diseases.
- Coxibs and diclofenac are contraindicated in patients with established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, or a history of stroke (including transient ischaemic attack). Etoricoxib is also contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

### Undesirable Effects
Virtually all NSAIDs are associated with the same complications. But the incidence depends on the nature of the NSAID, its dosage, the patient's condition, and any associated medications.

#### 1. Digestive Side Effects
- Frequent upper digestive symptoms (dyspepsia, gastralgia, nausea)
- Gastroduodenal ulcers and ulcer complications: digestive haemorrhage, perforation, less frequent with coxibs.
- Intestinal manifestations: ulcerations of the small intestine and colon, often unrecognised, sometimes with complications (perforation, haemorrhage, anaemia).

**Risk factors for serious digestive complications on NSAIDs:**
- Elderly subject: age > 65.
- A history of peptic ulcer disease, upper GI haemorrhage, or Helicobacter pylori infection.
- Severe co-morbidities.
- NSAIDs used in high doses or a combination of two NSAIDs.
- Co-prescription of aspirin (even in low doses for platelet anti-aggregation), anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants, corticosteroids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- Inflammatory disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).
- Active inflammatory bowel disease and history of diverticulitis.

#### 2. Renal Complications
- Acute functional renal failure: especially in elderly patients or those suffering from hypovolaemia.

**Risk factors:**
- Treatment with diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II antagonists.
- Dehydration.
- Dehydrated diet.
- Heart failure.
- High blood pressure due to fluid retention.
- Chronic renal failure (chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy).

#### 3. Cardiovascular Complications
- Arterial thrombotic risk: arterial thrombosis, with a greater risk for coxibs and diclofenac and, to a lesser extent, ibuprofen. Risk exists even with short-term prescriptions.
- Heart failure: especially if there is a history of heart disease and in elderly patients on diuretics.
- Risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

#### 4. Allergic Complications
- Skin allergies (urticarial eruptions, severe bullous dermatitis)
- Bronchospasm

#### 5. Gynaecological and Obstetric Complications
- Tocolytic activity
- Foetus: premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and renal failure from the sixth month of pregnancy.
- Reduced fertility

#### 6. Other Undesirable Effects
- Neurosensory disorders (headaches, vertigo, tinnitus, etc.).
- Cytopenias
- Hepatitis

### Precautions for Use
1. Personalised assessment of the benefit/risk ratio (taking into account the indication, the patient's condition, co-morbidities, and current medication).
2. Lowest possible dosage (dose-dependent adverse effects) and principles of multimodal analgesia for dose reduction.
3. Prescription as short as possible.
4. Consider alternatives (paracetamol, corticosteroids), especially in elderly patients or those at risk.
5. In adolescents, NSAIDs intended for adults can be used from the age of 15.
   - In children > 3 to 4 years: ibuprofen and tiaprofenic acid, dose adapted to weight.
   - In infants: aspirin, dose to be adapted to weight, avoid if viral infection (flu, chickenpox).
6. If digestive risk factor: co-prescription of a half-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
7. If cardiovascular history or cardiovascular risk factors:
   - If you have a history of ischaemic heart disease, arterial disease of the lower limbs, a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or congestive heart failure:
     - Contraindication to coxibs and diclofenac.
     - Non-selective NSAIDs not recommended.
   - If cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking): NSAIDs prescribed cautiously, only if necessary, with monitoring.
   - For patients on antiplatelet therapy:
     - The prescription of an NSAID should be avoided.
     - If necessary, should not lead to discontinuation of the antiaggregant.
8. The prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided in cases of renal insufficiency, including with topical cutaneous forms.
9. Avoid NSAIDs in the acute phase of a viral or bacterial infection.
10. Informing patients of the main risks involved and the risks of self-medication (NSAIDs sold over the counter as analgesics and antipyretics).
11. Search for possible drug interactions.

**Therapeutic Class Interactions:**
- **NSAIDs:** Do not combine two NSAIDs, including aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses.
- **Oral anticoagulant:** Increased risk of bleeding.
  - Piroxicam and aspirin in anti-inflammatory doses: contraindicated combination.
  - Other NSAIDs: combination not recommended. When this combination is essential, it requires close clinical and even biological monitoring.
- **Platelet antiaggregants (including aspirin at antiaggregation dose):** Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage. Patients taking aspirin at antiplatelet doses should be warned of the risks of self-medication with aspirin or another NSAID.
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants:** Increased risk of digestive haemorrhage.
- **Diuretic, angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB II):** Risk of acute renal failure in patients at risk (elderly and/or dehydrated patients).
- **Corticosteroid therapy:** Increased risk of gastrointestinal ulceration and haemorrhage.
- **Digoxin, Lithium, Aminoglycosides, High dose methotrexate:** Decreased renal excretion of the drug (risk of toxicity).
- **Drugs likely to promote hyperkalaemia (ACE inhibitors, ARB II, heparins, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and trimethoprim, particularly hyperkalaemic diuretics, especially when combined with each other or with potassium salts).**

### Monitoring Procedures
Regular clinical and biological monitoring in the event of prolonged prescription:
- BP, weight, oedema if history or cardiovascular or renal risk factors, or anti-hypertensive treatment.
- Digestive symptoms.
- Skin manifestations.
- Infection: serious infectious pathology should lead to discontinuation of treatment.
- Biology: haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate, liver enzymes, pro-BNP depending on the context.",0.7777777777777778,,False,False,0.7519452571868896,0.0,b,False,2,2

**Title:** Knowing Chronic Complications  
**Description:** Chronic urine retention, stasis lithiasis, obstructive renal failure, groin hernia  

== Definitions ==

Chronic complications of BPH should be investigated and treated surgically.

- Chronic retention of urine is suggested by the presence of a bladder globe which is not painful. In extreme cases, this retention leads to overflow micturition with urine leakage. It is confirmed by a reno-vesico-prostatic ultrasound (bladder with post-micturition residue > 150 cc). A differential diagnosis such as detrusor hypoactivity must be ruled out. The obstructive or acontractile origin of chronic retention can be differentiated by a dynamic urological assessment.

- Stasis lithiasis is linked to the presence of a chronic post-mictional residue which encourages the crystallization of urine. It leads to an increase in UABS and, more specifically, dysuria, and may be complicated by urinary tract infections or macroscopic haematuria. It is confirmed by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound (hyperechoic image).

- The diagnosis of obstructive renal failure complicating BPH is based on renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound, which shows bilateral dilatation of the pyelo-caliceal cavities, with alteration of the renal parenchyma, upstream of the subvesical obstruction, and an increase in creatinine levels in the biological work-up. There may be clinical signs of renal failure (oedema, weight gain, hypertension, nausea, etc.).

- Dysuria linked to the symptom of bladder emptying is associated with chronic abdominal thrusts which may be complicated by a groin hernia. Management is surgical and must be carried out after the BPH has been treated (deobstruction).",0.5714285714285714,16.028235294117646,False,True,0.7924567461013794,0.0,a,False,2,3

- The patient and his family must be warned of the risk of orchiectomy and sequelae of testicular atrophy if the testicle has been preserved.

**Necrotizing Fasciitis:**

- The treatment of necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia is multidisciplinary, based on the following management options:
  - Medical: In an intensive care unit with antibiotic therapy combining C3G and an aminoglycoside combined with an anti-anaerobic antibiotic.
  - Surgical: Under general anesthetic as an emergency measure, with surgical debridement of necrotic tissue without any closure. A urinary or digestive diversion may be necessary.

**Elementary Glomerular Lesions**

- Three techniques are used to study the glomerulus:
  - Light microscopy using PAS, trichrome, and silver staining.
  - Immunofluorescence examination using antibodies directed against IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, light chains of kappa and lambda immunoglobulins, and fibrin.
  - Electron microscopy.

- Four elementary glomerular lesions are usually described:
  - **Cell Proliferation:** Refer to Table 3.
  - **Sclerosis (or Fibrosis):** Fibrous scarring replacing the whole of the destroyed glomerulus (sclerotic glomerulus) or part of the destroyed glomerulus (segmental sclerosis).
  - **Deposits of Immunoglobulin Chains:** (IgG, IgM, IgA, Kappa, Lambda) or complement. Table 4 summarizes the different locations.
  - **Other Deposits:**
    - Hyaline deposits (segmental and focal hyalinosis).
    - Amyloid deposits (Ig chains: AL amyloidosis, SAA: AA amyloidosis).
    - Deposits of glycosylated proteins and extracellular matrix (diabetes).

Multifactorial management of T2DM involves considering all cardiovascular risk factors present in the patient. In addition to controlling blood sugar levels, therapeutic objectives include:

- Stopping smoking
- Controlling lipid levels and blood pressure
- Adhering to dietary rules
- Engaging in physical activity
- Taking medication

Therapeutic objectives (glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids) are tailored to the patient's clinical and biological profile.

Factors to consider when determining the glycaemic target (HbA1c) include:

- Duration of diabetes
- Life expectancy
- Existence of co-morbidities
- Risk of hypoglycaemia (SD-209) or other adverse drug reactions (SD-348)
- Patient's motivation

Lipid control targets are mainly adapted to cardiovascular risk (primary prevention, presence of risk factors, secondary prevention), and blood pressure targets are adapted to cardiovascular and renal risk (GFR, proteinuria).",0.75,15.518181818181823,False,True,0.847495436668396,0.0,b,False,2,4

**Title:** Knowing How to Diagnose Acute and Chronic Headaches  
**Description:** None  
**Rubric:** Positive Diagnosis  

== 1. Identify a Headache (SD-118) ==  
- **Adult and Child of Talking Age:** The patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.  
- **Infants and Small Children:** Atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilization of the head, or on the contrary, a prostrate, analgesic attitude.  

== 2. Reasoning When Faced with a Headache ==  
- **Primary Headaches** are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, item 99) and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.  
- **Secondary Headaches** have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.  
- The primary objective is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error), and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal hemorrhage).  

== 3. Interrogation ==  
- **Temporal Profile:** Crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:  
  - Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?  
  - How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?  
  - How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)  
  - How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?  
- **Other Features:**  
  - If long-standing: number of headache days/month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)  
  - Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days  
  - Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)  
  - Triggering and aggravating factors  
  - Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)  
  - Behavior: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated  
- **Context of Occurrence:**  
  - Family and personal history, vascular risk factors  
  - Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?  
  - Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)  
- **Associated Signs:**  
  - Digestive: nausea, vomiting  
  - Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia  
  - Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, ptosis, miosis, eye redness, eye edema  
  - Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles  
  - Fever, chills  
  - Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs, epileptic seizures, diplopia, visual impairment, eclipses  
- **Treatment Taken for Headaches:** Types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month  

== 4. Physical Examination ==  
- To look for abnormalities that could guide further investigations.  
- Normal in primary headaches (except dysautonomic signs of a facial vascular attack)  
- **General:** Blood pressure, temperature (beware of taking antipyretics, which can mask a fever), heart auscultation, and skin examination (purpura).  
- **Neurological:** Consciousness, meningeal syndrome (stiff neck), focal deficit, particularly cerebellar syndrome (ataxia may go unnoticed in a patient lying down and vomiting).  
- **Neuro-ophthalmological:** Visual field (homonymous lateral hemianopia), oculomotor paralysis (III or VI?), pupillary asymmetry (myosis/mydriasis), ptosis, (± papilledema on fundus).  
- **Local:** Inspection/palpation of skull, temporal arteries (if > 50 years old), eyeballs, ears, scalp (shingles), temporomandibular joints, neck.  
- **Postural Character:** Assess the intensity of the headache in the standing position and then in the lying position.  
- **Infant:** Fontanel (bulging?), cranial perimeter (increased?).  

== 5. Determination of Acute or Chronic Nature ==  
- **Any Acute Headache (in the sense of recent and unusual)** is secondary until proven otherwise and requires urgent investigations. In practice:  
  - Any sudden headache is a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) until proven otherwise.  
  - Any progressive headache is a syndrome of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) until proven otherwise.  
  - Any febrile headache with no other obvious cause is meningitis until proven otherwise.  
  - Certain red flags can help guide the diagnosis.  
  - Any recent change in an old, habitual headache raises the suspicion of a secondary headache.  
- A **Chronic** (in the sense of long-standing and habitual) headache is most often primary. The interview must be perfectly detailed, as the diagnosis is based solely on the description of the headache. In practice, a distinction is made between:  
  - Chronic episodic headaches (<15 headache days per month): episodic migraine and episodic tension headache  
  - Chronic daily headaches (CCQ, 15 days or more per month) subdivided into:  
    - Long-term QCC (seizures > 4 hours)  
    - Short-term QCC (attacks < 4 hours)  

**Box 1. Red Flags on Examination and Causes to Suspect**

**Description:** Know the Definition of Counterfeit Medicines

**Rubric:** Definition

**Definitions**

Counterfeiting a medicine is the deliberate and fraudulent misrepresentation of a medicine:

- Its identity: name, composition, activity, or other details.
- And/or its source: manufacturer, country of manufacture, country of origin, marketing authorization holders, distribution stages.

It can be applied to:

- Specialties or generic products
- Products containing the correct ingredients/components, no active ingredient, an insufficient amount of active ingredient, or products whose packaging has been tampered with.

Dating from 1992, this World Health Organization (WHO) definition serves as a reference. The same definition was extended to counterfeit health products by the International Medicines Products Anti-Counterfeiting Task Force (IMPACT) in 2008.

**Not to be Confused With:**

- Patent infringement or patent litigation
- Unregistered products: medical products (generics or specialties) that are not authorized for sale in a given country but are authorized for sale elsewhere.
- Unintentionally inferior products: batches that do not meet standards, quality defects, or failure to comply with good manufacturing or distribution practices.

""Fake medicines"" have a broader definition to extend the scope of the WHO's fight against counterfeit medicines:

- Counterfeit medicines: the concept of intellectual property protection varies greatly from country to country.
- Patent infringement: requires chemical analysis of the product.
- Trademark infringement: e.g., imitation packaging.

The term ""counterfeiting,"" which is ambiguous, is therefore being abandoned.

Several texts have been adopted to strengthen this fight, including the Council of Europe Convention on counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes threatening public health (known as Medicrime).",0.0,12.425714285714289,False,True,0.8758506178855896,0.0,d,True,2,3

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis  

Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with complete penetrance, linked to an expansion (abnormally high number) of CAG triplets on the ""HTT"" gene encoding the huntingtin protein on chromosome 4, detected by genetic analysis. The higher the number of CAG triplets, the earlier and more severe the onset of the disease.

**Clinical Signs:**

- Abnormal movements, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive impairment.
- The abnormal movements are primarily chorea, which spreads progressively and can affect the hands, feet, face, and trunk. As the disease progresses, dystonic abnormal movements and a parkinsonian syndrome may be encountered.
- Psychiatric disorders often involve mood (sad mood, moral pain) and/or behavior initially corresponding to a change in personality, disinhibition, depression, anxiety, sometimes a suicide attempt, or psychosis (delusional ideas, rare hallucinations).
- Associated with this is a subcortical-frontal cognitive decline with a dysexecutive syndrome progressing to dementia. Apathy (lack of interest and motivation) and anosognosia are frequent.

There is usually a family history. There are sporadic forms, which can be misleading in cases of early death of one of the parents (censorship), false paternity, or anticipation.

This condition involves the announcement of a chronic illness and the announcement of a serious illness to the patient and/or family.

---

A nephrological aetiology is considered if the urological work-up is negative and/or if there is a suggestive nephrological syndrome (highly suggestive associated proteinuria, hypertension, renal failure), or a personal or family history suggestive of hematuric nephropathy.

### A. Glomerular Nephropathy

To be considered if the hematuria is associated with glomerular proteinuria, hypertension, and renal failure, confirmed by renal biopsy:

- **Acquired Recurrent Macroscopic Hematuria Syndrome:** Suggestive of primary IgA nephropathy (mostly in young men: macroscopic hematuria 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection) or congenital: Alport syndrome (family background, deafness, ophthalmological involvement).
- In children, persistent microscopic hematuria should prompt a search for a glomerular cause:
  - Alport syndrome: microscopic or macroscopic hematuria.
  - Acute nephritic syndrome: acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis.

**Acute Nephritic Syndrome:** Most often post-infectious GN (10-15 days after streptococcal ENT infection), hypocomplementemia.

**Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN):** Rapid deterioration in renal function with glomerular syndrome (proteinuria + hematuria) with extra-renal signs revealing systemic disease or vasculitis.

### B. Acute Interstitial Nephropathy

Most often immuno-allergic (often drug-induced), it may combine hematuria with leucocyturia and renal failure, along with signs of the allergic series (skin rash, cytolysis, etc.).

### C. Nephrological Causes with Urological Clinical Presentation

Hematuria due to invasion of the urinary tree, responsible for lumbar pain:

- **Papillary Necrosis:** Migration of papillary fragments into the ureter, mimicking nephritic colic, on a favorable background (diabetes, sickle cell anemia, use of NSAIDs, etc.).
- **Renal Infarction:** Hematuria with sudden lumbar pain, requiring emergency treatment if it involves the main trunk of the renal artery. Causes include thromboembolic or vascular disease, sickle cell disease, or post-trauma.
- **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD):** Development of renal cysts in which the vessels in the wall may rupture, causing hematuria.

Criteria such as mortality, quality of life, occurrence of complications, etc., are of significant clinical relevance, but it is not always feasible to collect the most clinically relevant criterion.

Asthma, rhinitis

**Description:** None

**Rubric:** Positive diagnosis

**Definitions:**

The diagnosis of occupational asthma is based on:

1. **Demonstration of Asthma:** Positive diagnosis in a patient with or without a history of allergy (adult de novo asthma). It may be necessary to carry out a non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness test (metacholine) in the case of more atypical symptoms (nocturnal cough, chest tightness, etc.) and normal basal EFR. This asthma usually occurs in the first few years of exposure, and may follow allergic rhinitis, but can also occur at a later date, when a product or manufacturing process is changed, or when exposure is more extensive.

2. **Evidence of Occupational Exposure:** Exposure to a sensitizing agent, which may be easy to find (e.g., wheat or rye flour in a bakery, persulphates in a hairdresser's), or may require in-depth research with the occupational physician (chemical substances such as isocyanates, acid anhydrides, etc.).

3. **Link Between Asthma and Occupational Exposure:** This may be clinical (occupational rhythmicity of symptoms disappearing during weekends or holidays), functional (variations in peak flow or FEV1 depending on exposure), or even require a bronchoprovocation test in hospital.

Asthma associated with heavy or repeated exposure to non-sensitizing respiratory irritants, such as chlorine gas, phosgene, etc. (bronchial irritation syndrome), can also be encountered.

Finally, in a known non-occupational asthmatic, the existence of a ""possible aggravation of asthma"" associated with common irritant occupational exposures (welding fumes, building site dust, solvents, etc.) should be investigated.

Acute lung oedema occurs when plasma fluid diffuses into the extravascular pulmonary spaces (interstitium, alveolus).

There are two types:

**Lesional oedema due to alteration of the alveolar-capillary membrane**  
- Linked to an increase in permeability due to damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane.
- Pulmonary capillary pressure is normal or low (< 18 mmHg).
- The oedema fluid has a very high protein content, close to that of plasma.
- This is responsible for acute respiratory failure, which can progress to interstitial fibrosis, known as ARDS.

**Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary capillary hyperpressure**  
- Sudden or chronic increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP).
- In the normal state, the PCP is of the order of 7-12 mmHg and the oncotic pressure is 25 mmHg.
- Above 25 mmHg, there is extravasation of fluid into the interstitial tissue and then into the alveolus, leading to haematosis disorders with hypoxaemia and a reduction in lung compliance.

The mechanism of cardiogenic pulmonary oedema involves increased pulmonary capillary pressure leading to fluid extravasation.",1.0,15.518181818181823,False,True,0.8088482618331909,0.0,b,False,5,1

**Description:** Description of the different aetiologies of common spinal pain. Arguments in favour of a disc or interapophyseal origin.  
**Rubric:** Physiopathology  

== Definitions ==

**Elements indicating a DISC ORIGIN**

- Age 25-50
- Associated factor: exertion or trauma
- History of rapidly improving lumbago
- Physical examination: disc syndrome combining medial, mechanical, impulsive lumbago, exacerbated by hyperextension, spinal syndrome

Complications: radiculalgia, cauda equina syndrome.

**Elements indicating an INTERAPOPHYSEAL ORIGIN**

- Age > 50 years
- Median or unilateral low back pain, mechanical in character, exacerbated by walking or prolonged standing/sitting
- Pain referred remotely, without a precise path: buttocks, thighs, iliac spines
- Poor physical examination: hyperaesthesia of these painful areas on palpation, no disc syndrome, rare spinal syndrome

Complications: narrowed lumbar canal with radicular claudication (onset of difficulty in walking, intermittent limb claudication).",0.75,6.936363636363637,False,True,0.756571888923645,0.0,a,False,2,2
