'''Risk factors'''

The risk factors for ovarian cancer are not well known and appear to carry little weight (relative risk = 2 for almost all of these factors, which explains the difficulty in establishing a risk profile that can be used for a screening policy):

- The main risk factor is "genetic predisposition" (breast-ovarian syndrome with BRCA1 or 2 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome more rarely), and a personal or family history of breast cancer.

- '''Overweight and [[Obesity and overweight SD-051|obesity]] 319. [[Prevention of overweight and obesity SD-319|Prevention of overweight and obesity]]''''

- Prolonged ovulatory period: early menarche and late menopause, nulliparity and late first full-term pregnancy

- Age > 50 (50% of ovarian cancers occur after age 50) '''294. [[Gynaecology follow-up consultation SD-294|Gynaecology follow-up consultation]]'''''

- Infertility and ovulation-inducing treatments (in particular stimulation with Clomiphene, ClomidÂ®)

- Hormonal treatment of the ''[[Follow-up consultation for a menopausal woman SD-278|menopause]]'' based on oestrogens

- Environmental factors: '''[[Occupational risk prevention SD-315|occupational exposure]]''' to asbestos (IARC, 2012) and talcum powder

- '''[[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314|Tobacco addiction]]''''


'''Protective factors'''

- Oral contraception

- Pregnancy

- Breastfeeding

- Tubal ligatures
