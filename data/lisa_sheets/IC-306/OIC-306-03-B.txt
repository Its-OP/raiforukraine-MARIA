'''Organic benign tumours''':

- 5 to 10% of women will develop an ovarian tumour during their lifetime, most often a benign ovarian cyst.

'''Malignant epithelial tumours''' :

- 8<sup>th</sup> most common cancer in women and 2<sup>nd</sup> gynaecological cancer in order of frequency after endometrial cancer in 2018

- 4<sup>th</sup> cause of cancer deaths in women in 2018

- Mostly affect women after the ''menopause''.

- Â¾ of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage (FIGO stage IIIc and IV)

- Poor prognosis: overall survival at 5 years of 43% for all stages combined, 85% for stage I and less than 20% for stage IIIc-IV.

- Around 10% of ovarian cancers occur in the context of a genetic "predisposition".

Borderline tumours of the ovary (BTO):

- 10 to 20% of malignant tumours

- Almost a third of cases occur in women under the age of 40

- In the majority of cases, OFDs are discovered at an early stage

- High survival rate, with overall survival of over 94% at 10 years

- Low risk of invasive recurrence (0.5% to 3.8%)
