- '''Wound healing theory''': each ovulation creates a minor trauma in the form of a break in the epithelial surface. During the healing process, inclusion cysts of ovarian epithelium can form in the stroma, leading to proliferation and then neoplastic transformation.


- More recent hypothesis: ''Tubal origin of neoplastic cells'' through invasion of tubal dysplastic cells of the ovarian cortex (Serous Tubal Intraepithelial Carcinoma or STIC). Anatomopathological studies of prophylactic adnexectomy specimens have shown a high rate of pre-invasive lesions in the tubal horn.

- Extension of ovarian cancer through the natural flow of peritoneal fluid (rapid passage from a localised stage to a stage covering the entire peritoneal cavity), through lymphatic drainage (pelvic and lumbo-aortic) and, more rarely, haematological dissemination (lungs, liver, brain).

- '''Genetic forms of ovarian cancer''' :

Mutation of the BRCA 1 or 2 genes: the cause of cancers before the age of 60. These cancers have a better prognosis because they are more chemosensitive than sporadic cancers.

In practice: A patient with a BRCA1 mutation has a risk of around 40% (22-59%) of developing epithelial ovarian cancer. In the case of a BRCA2 mutation, the risk is lower, around 10% (4-18%).

More rarely, ovarian cancers may form part of the autosomal dominant Lynch or HNPCC syndrome, caused by damage to genes belonging to the MMR system. Its frequency varies from 1/1000 to 1/400.  It is responsible for 2% of ovarian cancers, 6% of endometrial cancers and 1 to 3% of colorectal cancers.

In practice: A patient with a deleterious constitutional mutation in an MMR gene has a risk of developing ovarian cancer of around 10%.
