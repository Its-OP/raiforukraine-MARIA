'''Additional imaging tests:''''

'''Pelvic ultrasound'''' '''by abdominal then endovaginal route.''''

This is the first-line examination, not only for diagnostic purposes, but also to determine the size, bilaterality, location, shape, echostructure and vascularisation of the cyst. Associated signs such as ascites or other masses are also investigated.

The following ultrasound criteria should be interpreted according to the patient's menopausal status and age:
{| class="wikitable"
|Ultrasound criteria in favour of a ''functional cyst''.
|Ultrasound criteria in favour of an "organic cyst".
|Ultrasound criteria in favour of malignancy
|-
|Unilocular</nowiki>

- Pure liquid

- In a non-menopausal patient
|<Existence of a septum</nowiki>.

- Thickened walls

- Heterogeneous content

- Irregular contours

- Doppler vascularisation

- Large lesion
|<Endo or exo cystic vegetations</nowiki>.

- Ascites

- Adenopathies

- Associated pelvic mass

'''Abdominal-pelvic MRI''''

In the case of a localised form or an ovarian mass that is indeterminate or complex on ultrasound, pelvic and abdominal MRI down to the renal pedicle can be used to better characterise the tumour (value of perfusion and diffusion sequences) and to assess local-regional extension.

An international classification system, the Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting & Data System (O-RADS), helps to identify suspicious ovarian masses.

'''Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography'''

A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan with injection (particularly in the case of an advanced form) is used to assess the pre-therapeutic extension and resectability of peritoneal carcinosis of ovarian origin.

18-FDG Positron Emission Tomography

18-FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET-CT is an option for extension assessment in advanced stages.
