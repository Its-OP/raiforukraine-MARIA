#Functional tumours related to hormonal dysfunction: follicular cysts in the 1st<sup> part of the cycle, corpus luteum cysts or luteal cysts in the 2nd<sup> part of the cycle.
#Non-functioning ovarian tumours

These tumours of the ovary are benign or malignant proliferative processes, primary or secondary, cystic in appearance, solid or vegetative, whose growth is not directly linked to hormonal dysfunction:

- '''Organic benign tumours''': most often benign ovarian cysts

- '''Malignant tumours'''

- Borderline tumours of the ovary
