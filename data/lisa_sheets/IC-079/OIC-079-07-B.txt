Let's take the example of JHA

the principles of "primary prevention" are based on "informing and educating players". Ideally, they should involve the managers of casinos, gaming rooms or online gambling sites.

Secondary prevention is based in particular on the training of specialised (psychologists) or non-specialised staff (dealers, room staff, etc.) who can directly identify individuals displaying pathological behaviour.

For all behavioural addictions, early detection is vital for the purposes of secondary prevention and to limit the onset of disorders and the appearance of excessive damage.
