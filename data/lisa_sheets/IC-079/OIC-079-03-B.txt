Behavioural addictions are multifactorial in origin.

There are genetic predisposing factors and other individual risk factors (gender, age, thrill-seeking or impulsive personality traits).

Other risk or vulnerability factors include psychiatric comorbidities (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, antisocial personality disorder), addictive comorbidities (substances, other behavioural addictions), as well as other individual and environmental factors (early onset of behaviour, high availability, low cost, parental environment and use by parents, peer behaviour, school failure, stressful life events, physical and psychological trauma, domestic violence).

In terms of course and prognosis, JHA is a disease which, if left untreated, carries a high risk of relapse. A small percentage of sufferers seek treatment (10-20%, depending on the study). Treatment is usually provided several years after the onset of the disease, with a high risk of patients being lost to follow-up (between 15 and 50%).
