The mechanisms of behavioural addiction share the pathophysiological bases described in substance use disorders. Behavioural addictions can involve a variety of activities: gambling, video games, sexual activities, internet use (social networking, etc.), shopping and physical exercise. Two behavioural addictions are officially recognised as such in international diagnostic classifications: gambling disorder and video game disorder.

Games of chance and gambling (GAG) are games in which the subject irreversibly bets an asset and the outcome of the game results in a loss or gain, depending partly or entirely on chance. Games of chance can be played online (on the Internet) or offline (in gaming venues).
