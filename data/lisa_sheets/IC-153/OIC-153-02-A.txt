===''Main complications of valve prosthesis wearers'' ===

===='''''Thrombo-embolic complications'''''====
Thromboembolic complications are one of the most frequent complications. They mainly concern mechanical valves, but also biological prostheses, particularly those implanted percutaneously. They are more frequent in the first year.

Three main risk factors have been identified:

- Prosthesis in mitral/tricuspid position versus aortic position (lower pressure regime)

- Presence of atrial fibrillation or left ventricular dysfunction

- Old generation mechanical prosthesis

A poorly balanced INR remains the main cause of thrombo-embolic complications in the case of mechanical valves.

In the case of mitral and aortic prostheses, they are manifested by systemic embolisms, potentially cerebral (TIA or stroke), more rarely embolisms responsible for acute limb ischaemia, splenic or renal infarction.

More rarely, obstructive prosthesis thrombosis may occur. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy, with a picture of PAO or cardiogenic shock. Auscultation is altered but not pathognomonic (systolic murmur for an aortic prosthesis or diastolic murmur for a prosthesis in the mitral position).

Diagnosis is essentially paraclinical, with TTE and TEE showing an increase in trans-valvular gradients, a reduction in the functional valve area and sometimes an image of thrombus visible on the prosthesis. In the case of mechanical prostheses, radiocinema of the valve can also reveal blockage or reduced mobility of the leaflets.

INR measurement is essential in any clinical situation where there is a suspicion of prosthesis thrombosis.

The management of acute prosthesis thrombosis may require emergency surgery, with a high mortality rate (around 30%).

In sub-acute forms or those with minor dysfunction, or in inoperable patients, correction of anticoagulation or the addition of an anti-aggregant, or even thrombolysis, may be suggested.

The main differential diagnosis remains infective endocarditis.

===='''''Prosthesis disinsertion'''''====
Disinsertion of a prosthesis is responsible for a para-prosthetic leak, i.e. between the valve annulus and the Dacron<sup>TM</sup> or Teflon<sup>TM flange</sup>. The main aetiology to look for and evoke remains, above all, infective endocarditis. Suture loosening without infectious origin is also possible.

The clinical picture is one of aortic or mitral insufficiency, with severity and rate of onset depending on the speed of onset and grade of the leak.

Auscultation therefore reveals a diastolic aortic murmur or a systolic murmur at the mitral focus.

Biological tests may reveal haemolytic anaemia (increased LDH, reduced haptoglobin and presence of shizocytes), more frequently in the mitral position.

The key examination is TTE (and TEE), which reveals a Doppler flow of para-prosthetic regurgitation.

Depending on the severity and rapidity of the leak, management may range from simple monitoring to surgical intervention. In cases where surgery is contraindicated, or in subjects at high risk of surgery, percutaneous closure may be discussed.

===='''''Degeneration of bioprostheses'''''====
The main disadvantage of bioprostheses is that they degenerate over time. This degeneration most often expresses itself in a stenosing mode, more rarely in a receding mode (which generally progresses more rapidly) or in a mixed mode.

The average time before the appearance of ultrasound signs of degeneration is around 8 years.

The risk factors are male gender, implantation at a young age, renal insufficiency, abnormal calcium metabolism, dyslipidaemia, patient/prosthesis mismatch and bioprostheses in the mitral position.


Management ranges from simple monitoring in early forms to replacement of the degenerated prosthesis (either surgically or percutaneously).

===='''''Infectious endocarditis (IE)'''''====
This is a complication that should be systematically investigated in the event of a complication in a patient with a valve prosthesis.

The 5-year incidence of AR in valve prosthesis patients is around 5%, with the majority of events occurring in the first year following implantation.

Early postoperative AEs (<1 year after implantation) are mainly linked to "Staphylococcus epidermitis" or "Aureus".

Conversely, late postoperative AEs (>1 year after implantation) have a bacterial ecology similar to AEs on native valves (Staphylococci, Enterococci, Streptococci).

Management is discussed on a case-by-case basis, depending on the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities, and the echocardiographic features of the IE. Antibiotic treatment is systematic, lasting at least 6 weeks, and may be combined with surgical management.

===='''''Hemorrhagic complications associated with VKAs'''''====
They concern patients with mechanical valves, but also patients with biological valves where curative anticoagulation is indicated (AF in particular). The risk is approximately 2% patient-years.

The symptoms vary: cerebral haemorrhage, digestive haemorrhage, haematuria, gingivorrhage, etc. A thorough clinical examination to look for any signs of seriousness is essential.

Management is the same as for an overdose of VKA (see Item 183).
