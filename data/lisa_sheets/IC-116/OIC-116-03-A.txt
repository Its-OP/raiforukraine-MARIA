Pruritus is diagnosed clinically, based on questioning. It may be confirmed by the existence of non-specific skin lesions following scratching: excoriations, ulcerations. Prurigo is a disease secondary to the vicious circle of pruritus/scratching/pruritus and the autonomisation of pruritus, leading to nodule- or papule-like lesions.
