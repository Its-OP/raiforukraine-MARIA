Cystic fibrosis can appear at different ages. 10-20% of cases appear in newborns, 80% in infants and 10-20% later in children, adolescents and adults. Penetrance is complete, but expressivity and severity are extremely variable. The disease combines pulmonary involvement with external pancreatic insufficiency.

'''Manifestations in the neonatal period'''

Delayed release of meconium or meconium ileus (occlusion).

Manifestations in infants

- Digestive signs

Steatorrhea ([[Diarrhea SD-002|diarrhea]] greasy and foul), associated with [[Abdominal pain SD-004|abdominal pain]] and malnutrition.

Staturo-ponderal retardation ([[Staturo-ponderal growth anomalies SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]), hypoprotidemia, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency

[Constipation SD-001|Constipation, which may be complicated by rectal prolapse

- Respiratory signs

Chronic [[Cough SD-167|Cough]]

Recurrent respiratory infections: bronchitis, pneumonitis, rhinosinusitis


Manifestations in children, adolescents and adults

-Chronic respiratory disease

[[Dyspnea SD-162|Dyspnea]], wheezing, [[Cough SD-167|cough]], [[Expectoration SD-163|expectoration]] mucopurulent

Repeated (chronic) bronchial infections: the germs most often involved are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

- Damage to the upper airways

Recurrent sinusitis

Nasal polyps

- Pancreatic and digestive disorders

[[Constipation SD-001|Constipation]]

[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: steatorrhea, malabsorption, malnutrition, pancreatitis, diabetes

Hepatobiliary disease: jaundice, biliary cirrhosis ([[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]])

- Damage to the genital tract

In men: atresia of the vas deferens (98%), leading to obstructive azoospermia and infertility ([[Difficulty procreating SD-033|difficulty procreating]]).

In women: inconstant hypofertility (thick cervical mucus).

- Other symptoms

Joint pain secondary to arthritis

Salt loss syndrome: dehydration, metabolic alkalosis
