A person with trisomy 21 is born with axial hypotonia associated with varying degrees of medical complications (sometimes none, often several). Medical complications need to be treated early and rehabilitation needs to be started quickly. Rehabilitation can take place in the private sector or in a CAMSP (Centre d'action médico-sociale précoce for 0-6 year olds) then SESSAD (Service d'éducation spéciale et de soins à domicile, up to the age of 20).

Throughout life, it is important to know how to look for the main complications (see [[Evolution of trisomy 21|2C-045-SP-A01]]) and to treat them in order to avoid, in particular, over-handicap (vision problems, hypoacusis, hypothyroidism).

People with trisomy 21 have a margin of progression, which varies from one patient to another and is impossible to predict. They have a psychomotor delay ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|anomaly of psychomotor development]]). For example, walking is acquired on average between 2 and 3 years of age, compared with between 9 and 18 months for a child without Down's syndrome. Language acquisition is often the most delayed, accompanied by speech disorders ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]).

Puberty proceeds normally.

People with trisomy 21 are often short (over - 2 DS) ([[Anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth SD-026|anomalies of staturo-ponderal growth]]) and have a tendency to develop obesity which should be treated by hygienic and dietary measures and by encouraging the practice of sport.

The majority of children with Down's syndrome are able to recognise words, and even to read, write a few words and count a little, allowing them a degree of independence.

Inclusion in the mainstream environment should be encouraged as far as possible, either in normal classes or in adapted classes (ULIS: Unités Localisées pour l'Inclusion Scolaire). If the child has reached his or her limits in terms of acquiring school skills, he or she may be admitted to an IME (Institut médico-éducatif) or an IMPro (Institut médico-professionnel) to work on independence and learn a trade.

Adults with Down's syndrome can be housed (rare). They can work in a mainstream workplace (rare), work in an ESAT (Établissement et service d'aide par le travail, the majority), stay with their parents or move into a so-called occupational home.

Adults with Down's syndrome usually have an emotional life and some women (rare) have children.

In adulthood, the question arises of guardianship, curatorship or family administrative supervision to protect these people, particularly financially.

From their fifties onwards, people with Down's syndrome begin to experience the complications associated with premature ageing and an increased risk of dementia, particularly of the Alzheimer's type ([[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|memory impairment/cognitive decline]]).

Life expectancy is estimated at 60 years.
