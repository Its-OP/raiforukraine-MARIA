The diagnosis is currently made most often (80-90%) in the ante-natal period. If this is not the case, the diagnosis is made in the neonatal period on the basis of the triad:

- Axial hypotonia

- Heart murmur on auscultation ([[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation]])

- Facial dysmorphia

Very rarely, the diagnosis may be made later (mosaic trisomy 21) based on the following factors

- Psychomotor retardation ([[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|psychomotor development abnormality]])

- Learning difficulties associated with immaturity
