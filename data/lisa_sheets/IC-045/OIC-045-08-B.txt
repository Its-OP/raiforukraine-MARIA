Trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome is suspected clinically and confirmed chromosomally.

The test to be prescribed is a constitutional karyotype on lymphocytes: 2 ml peripheral venous blood sample in a heparinised tube.

Parents/patients need to be informed and asked to sign a consent form with a certificate of genetic counselling.

Information must be provided on

- the objective (purpose) of the test (diagnosis of trisomy 21) ;

- the nature of the test, in this case karyotype ;

- the limitations of the test (no detection of abnormalities of less than 5 megabases (Mb), weak mosaics, nucleotide variants, risk of culture failure, etc.);

- the delivery time (4-5 days in the case of trisomy 21);

- the need to inform relatives if a serious condition justifying preventive measures, including genetic counselling, or care is identified.


A Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) study can be requested for a preliminary result within 24-48 hours.

To carry out genetic counselling, it is necessary to have the results of the karyotype in order to know the mechanism causing trisomy 21.


Karyotyping can identify three types of results:

- Complete and homogeneous free trisomy 21: 95% of cases

o Free: 3 separate 21 chromosomes

o Complete: the whole of chromosome 21

o Homogenous: in all cells

- Complete mosaic free trisomy 21 2-3% of cases

o Mosaic = two cell populations: cells with three 21 chromosomes and cells with two 21 chromosomes

- Complete trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation: 2-3% of cases

o Robertstonian translocation: fusion of two acrocentric chromosomes. The most common example is a fusion between chromosome 14 and 21.


NB: partial trisomy 21 can be identified by an unbalanced translocation involving part of chromosome 21 and part of another chromosome.

For a person with trisomy 21, there is no phenotypic difference depending on the chromosomal anomaly, except in the case of weak mosaics (less than 50%) and partial trisomy 21.
