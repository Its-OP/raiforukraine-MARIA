Cystic fibrosis is most often diagnosed in the first few weeks of life following positive neonatal screening ([Systematic neonatal screening SD-308|Systematic neonatal screening]]). However, it may be diagnosed later in adolescence or adulthood. A positive diagnosis is confirmed by a sweat test. This test involves collecting sweat from both forearms after stimulation with pilocarpine, and then measuring the chlorine content. When the test value is above 60 meq/L, the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is confirmed. Between 40 and 60 meq/L, the result is considered intermediate and the test must be repeated.
