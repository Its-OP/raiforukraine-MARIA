Premutations are involved in pathology and family members are exposed to different risks depending on their genetic status and sex.

The pathological mechanism of premutations is toxicity (gain of function) in nervous and ovarian tissue.

== Premature ovarian failure linked to FMR1 (FXPOI): ==

* 20% of premutation carriers have ovarian dysfunction
* May lead to premature ovarian failure (< 40 years) known as FXPOI (Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency) and premature menopause ([[Difficulty in procreating SD-033|difficulty in procreating]], [[Menstrual cycle disorders SD-094|menstrual cycle disorders]]).
* It is recommended that women of childbearing age who are carriers of premutation be offered an endocrinology consultation to estimate their ovarian reserve.
* Ovarian cryopreservation or pre-implantation diagnosis may be proposed depending on the ovarian reserve.

== FMR1-related tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS): ==

* FXTAS: Fragile X associated Tremor Ataxia Syndrome
* 40% of men and 16% of women carry the premutation
* Onset after the age of 60
* Variable association of action or rest tremor, cerebellar ataxia, parkinsonian syndrome, myoclonus, cognitive disorders, various psychiatric disorders and sensory neuropathy ([[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]]'',''' [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]], [[Memory impairment/cognitive decline SD-131|memory impairment/cognitive decline]], [[Balance impairment SD-130|balance impairment]])
* Abnormal brain MRI: most characteristic abnormalities = hypersignals of the middle cerebellar peduncles and/or splenium of the corpus callosum.
* The risk of FXTAS increases especially in carriers of a pre-mutation >70 CGG.
* Genetic counselling must be cautious in men: because of the risk of FXTAS, genetic testing may take on the characteristics of a presymptomatic test.

== Neuropsychiatric disorders linked to premutations: ==

* Carriers of premutations are at increased risk of developing attention disorders, hyperactivity or autism spectrum disorders, compared with the general population ([[Child and Adolescent Behaviour Disorder SD-133|Child and Adolescent Behaviour Disorder]], [[Attention Disorder SD-129|Inattention Disorder]]).
* Carriers of premutations may also be at risk for certain conditions including anxiety-depressive disorders, social phobias and chronic pain (fibromyalgia) ([[Social interaction disorders/socialisation difficulties SD-349|social interaction disorders/socialisation difficulties]]).
* The acronym FXAND (''Fragile X-associated neuropsychiatric disorders'') has recently been proposed to facilitate the diagnosis and management of these disorders.
