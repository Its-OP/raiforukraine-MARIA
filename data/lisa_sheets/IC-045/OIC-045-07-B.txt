The risk of recurrence depends on the karyotype:

- Free, complete and homogeneous trisomy 21: recurrence risk of approximately 1% unless the mother is over 40 (risk then linked to the mother's age);

- Mosaic trisomy 21: low risk of recurrence ;

- Trisomy 21 by translocation: high risk of recurrence if translocation inherited from a parent

o Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (14;21)

§ If of maternal origin: risk of recurrence 10-15%.

§ If of paternal origin: risk of recurrence 2-5 %.

o Trisomy 21 by Robertsonian translocation (21;21)

§ Risk of recurrence: 100% if inherited from a healthy parent (non-viable monosomy 21).


In the case of free trisomy 21, it is not necessary to carry out the parents' karyotype (de novo occurrence, generally due to meiotic non-disjunction).

In the case of trisomy 21 by translocation, it is necessary to carry out karyotyping of the parents. In the event of a balanced anomaly in one parent, the family branch concerned should be further investigated in order to identify the other carriers.

The increased risk of recurrence after the birth of a child with Down's syndrome means that parents can request a foetal karyotype if they so wish.

If the parents do not wish to take the risk of miscarriage, PND can be offered.

Men with Down's syndrome have reduced fertility. A few pregnancies have been initiated by men with Down's syndrome. The children did not have trisomy 21. Fertility in women with trisomy 21 is reduced but pregnancies are possible. The risk of trisomy 21 is around 30% in women with trisomy 21.
