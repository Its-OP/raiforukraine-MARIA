'''Main clinical manifestations of trisomy 21 or Down's syndrome:'''

- Heart disease in 40-50% of cases. In order of frequency atrioventricular canal (AVC), ventricular septal defect (VSD), atrial septal defect (ASD): know how to look for a [[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|anomaly on cardiac auscultation]]

- Psychomotor retardation

- Intellectual disability

- Sleep disorders with almost 50% obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome

- Digestive malformations: anal imperforation, duodenal stenosis

- Hypoacusis/ Deafness to be detected

- Risk of congenital cataract (1%)

- Attention deficit, impulsivity, intolerance to frustration

- Autism spectrum disorders in 5-10% of patients

- Epilepsy (West syndrome) in 5% of patients

- Recurring ENT infections

- Facial dysmorphia: microcephaly, flat profile; palpebral slits oblique upwards and outwards; small, round ear pavilions; flat neck with excess skin; joint and skin hyperlaxity; brachymesophalangia of the 5<sup>th</sup> fingers: clinodactyly; single transverse palmar crease (2/3 of cases); increased spacing between the first and second toes with wrinkled soles.

- Delayed growth in height and weight

- Flat feet with frequent valgus

- Hyperlaxity with possible C1/C2 instability

- Language delay


'''At birth'''

Examination of the newborn

- Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or family

- Look for heart disease.

- Assessment of hypotonia


Contact

- Look for eating difficulties with swallowing problems (oral disorders that may require rehabilitation by a speech therapist).

- Identifying regurgitation (gastro-oesophageal reflux), which is more frequent in infants with trisomy 21

- Ask about transit disorders: [[Constipation SD-001|constipation]] frequent

- Monitoring weight gain: [[Weight and height growth abnormalities SD-026| Weight and height growth retardation]] frequent (often over -2 SD)

Screening

- Hearing loss or deafness (PEAP currently used routinely)

- Congenital cataract, strabismus, nystagmus more frequent in children with trisomy 21 ([[Vision anomaly SD-138|Vision anomaly]])


'''In infants'''

- Monitoring diet and growth in height and weight. How to look for coeliac disease

- Breast-feeding possible but often more difficult (oral disorders).

- Search for signs of West syndrome ([[Convulsions SD-120|convulsions]])


'''In children'''

Assess the extent of the psychomotor delay ([[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|psychomotor development abnormality]])

- Assess the extent of language delay ([[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]])

- Assess the extent of cognitive delay ([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])

- Suggest hygienic and dietary measures to combat the onset of obesity

- Research into oral disorders

- Screen for otorrhoea (frequent ENT infection), serous otitis

- Look for clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism: prescribe a TSHus and T4l every year ([[Thyroid work-up analysis SD-194|Thyroid work-up analysis]]). If dysthyroidism, ask for an antibody assay (anti-thyroglobulin).

- Look for [[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]] and/or splenomegaly. Signs in favour of acute leukaemia: 10 times more frequent in children with trisomy 21.

- Check the platelet count every year or every 2 years for frequent abnormalities of the haemogram, particularly lymphopenia and thrombocytosis, more rarely thrombocytopenia. It can also be used to diagnose acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

- In the event of neurological signs, a radiological examination should be ordered to look for C1/C2 instability with signs of spinal cord compression (MRI recommended rather than X-rays). Similarly, because of the hyperlaxity, there is a greater risk of valgus flat feet and dislocation of the patellas.

- Look for autism spectrum disorders, which are slightly more common in children with Down's syndrome ([[Behavioural disorders in children and adolescents SD-133|behavioural disorders in children and adolescents]]).

- Knowing how to look for sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia. It is estimated that almost 50% of children with Down's syndrome have obstructive sleep apnoea.

- Children with Down's syndrome are more prone to autoimmune problems: thyroiditis, diabetes, alopecia and hair loss.


At the paraclinical level, prescribe rehabilitation treatments

- Physiotherapy from 2-3 months

- Speech therapy from birth in the case of oral disorders or around 9 months of age

- Psychomotricity around 1-2 years

- Occupational therapy depending on progress

- Psychological follow-up if necessary


'''In adulthood'''

- Explaining treatment to disabled patients

- How to look for testicular cancer in men with trisomy 21

- Early ageing

- Increased risk of dementia: know how to look for [[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]

- Episodes of [[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]] earlier than in other people

- Increased risk of epilepsy, which may be a gateway to Alzheimer's disease.

- Men with trisomy 21 have [[Difficulty in procreating SD-033|Significant difficulties in procreating]]. Women can have children.
