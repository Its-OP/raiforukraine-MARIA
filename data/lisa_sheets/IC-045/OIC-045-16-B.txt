Clinical care is provided by the Cystic Fibrosis Resource and Competence Centres (CRCM).

The main principles of clinical management are based on :

- Combating salt loss by regular supplementation;

- Management of gastrointestinal disorders: a high-calorie, low-fat diet with digestive enzymes and fat-soluble vitamins;

- Management of pulmonary pathology: high-dose antibiotics to reduce chronic respiratory infection, mucolytic treatments and respiratory physiotherapy.

- In severe cases, a lung and/or liver transplant may be performed.

- Male infertility is treated by medically assisted procreation (in vitro fertilisation).


New therapies known as "specific mutations" have recently been developed. These are small molecules, called modulators, which aim to correct the defective CFTR protein.
