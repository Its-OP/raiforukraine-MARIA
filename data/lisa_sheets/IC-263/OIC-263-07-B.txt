'''Atheromatous renal artery stenosis:'''

* Elderly subjects with several cardiovascular risk factors, including pre-existing hypertension. This develops into :
** hypertension resistant to triple therapy including a diuretic;
** causing flash PAO
** deterioration in renal function on ACE inhibitors or ARBs2 ;
** chronic renal failure in cases of bilateral stenosis (ischaemic nephropathy).


'''Fibrodysplasia of the renal artery:'''

* Newly discovered hypertension, sometimes severe and symptomatic;
* sometimes associated with hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis (secondary hyperaldosteronism).
