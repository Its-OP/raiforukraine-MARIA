'''Renal infarction:'''

* Acute occlusion of a renal artery or its branches may occur :
** an abnormality in the vascular wall: dissection of the renal artery
** by arterial embolism (atrial fibrillation, valvulopathy)
** linked to thrombophilia.

'''Cholesterol crystal emboli disease:'''

* A disease linked to the obstruction of arterioles and capillaries by cholesterol crystals following the rupture of an atheromatous plaque, often revealed by cutaneous signs.


'''Benign nephroangiosclerosis:'''

* Chronic vascular nephropathy, a late consequence of long-standing, inadequately controlled hypertension.
* This condition can lead to end-stage renal failure.
* Anatomically, it corresponds to progressive obliteration of the small vessels by fibrous endarteritis.
