Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a form of acute renal failure associated with an acute myelosuppression syndrome (AMS).

In the case of typical HUS, this picture of HUS is part of a context of often bloody diarrhoea caused by Shigatoxin-secreting enterobacteria (E. Coli, Shigella), typically in children, in the form of a small epidemic.
