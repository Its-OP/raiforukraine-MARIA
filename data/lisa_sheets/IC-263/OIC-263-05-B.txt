Combination of acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia following food contamination causing bloody diarrhoea. Diagnosis is confirmed by isolation of the STEC strain (shigatoxin-producing Escherichia coli) or PCR detection of shigatoxin-encoding genes in stools.

Atypical HUS occurs more frequently in adults, without diarrhoea, and is most often linked to an acquired or genetic abnormality of the complement pathway. It often recurs, particularly after renal transplantation, and has a more severe prognosis. Treatment is based on plasma exchange and/or complement inhibition.
