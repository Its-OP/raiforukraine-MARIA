Vascular nephropathies are a group of heterogeneous diseases characterised by damage to the renal vessels. Some diseases involve the large vessels (obstruction of the renal arteries), others the small vessels (nephroangiosclerosis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and cholesterol crystal embolism diseases). Drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education of a hypertensive patient SD-282|HTA]] is often at the forefront. It may be the cause or consequence of kidney disease. Vascular nephropathies can be classified according to their rate of progression and the location of renal arterial damage (table 1).
