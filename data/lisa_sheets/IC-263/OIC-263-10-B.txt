'''Renal infarction:'''

*The picture is brutal and may associate :
**back pain mimicking renal colic" or abdominal pain;
**macroscopic haematuria;
**hypertensive flare-up;
**anuria if the occlusion is bilateral or in a single kidney;
**fever.
*Biology:
**elevation of LDH ;
**variable elevation of creatinine;
**inflammatory syndrome.
*The diagnosis is confirmed by spiral CT scan, MRI angiography or arteriography.
*This is an emergency because revascularisation (by intraluminal angioplasty or surgery) can only be performed in the first few hours following occlusion. The therapeutic alternatives are fibrinolytics and anticoagulants.

'''[[Follow-up of a patient in chronic renal failure SD-290|Benign nephroangiosclerosis]] :''''

*This is often a diagnosis of exclusion, with no specific elements, and is based on a number of arguments:
**background: cardiovascular history, cardiovascular risk factors, elderly subject,
**Long-standing hypertension, often poorly controlled and with repercussions (left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive retinopathy);
**slowly progressive chronic renal failure;
**poor urinary syndrome:
**no haematuria or leucocyturia
**proteinuria absent or moderate;
**kidneys of normal or reduced size depending on the degree of renal failure, symmetrical in size, with harmonious contours and no renal artery stenosis.

'''Cholesterol embolism diseases:'''

Diagnosis is based on the combination of an atheromatous background, a triggering factor and the clinical picture.

Presentation of cholesterol crystal emboli
{| class="wikitable"
|Triggering factors
|- On atheromatous terrain ++ :

- Aortic surgery.

- Arteriography (performed a few days to several weeks before the first signs appear).

- Anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment.
|-
|Clinical signs
|- Often a few days or weeks after the triggering factor (latency period).

- Acute renal failure.

- Purple toes, livedo, distal gangrene.

- Asthenia, myalgias.

- Signs of mesenteric ischaemia.

- Neurological signs: stroke, transient ischemic attack, confusional syndrome.

- Vision problems.
|-
|Biological signs
|- Inflammatory syndrome.

- Eosinophilia, hypocomplementemia (these last 2 signs are inconstant).
|}


The diagnosis must be confirmed by one of the following 3 tests to identify the crystals:

*fundus ;
*skin biopsy of a livedo (risk of non-healing +++);
*renal biopsy: this shows occlusion of small-calibre arterioles by cholesterol crystal emboli, with a significant inflammatory reaction in the vicinity.
