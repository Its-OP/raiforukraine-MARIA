* '''Prerequisites:''''
** Chronic consumption vs acute intoxication ("binge drinking")
** Quantification of chronic consumption: low = 10-20 g/d (1-2 drinks), moderate = 20-30 g/d (2-3 drinks), high >30 g/d (> 3 drinks).
* '''Effect of alcohol on risk factors:''''
** Promotes obesity (calorie intake).      
** Chronic heavy drinking (over 30 g/L) increases blood pressure (BP) and the risk of diabetes.
** Does not significantly alter LDL-c, increases triglycerides but also HDL-cholesterol.
* '''Potentially protective effect of alcohol (low to moderate doses):'''
** Increases HDL cholesterol,
** Increases insulin sensitivity,
** Antioxidant effect,
** Anti-inflammatory effect,
** Antiplatelet effect.
* '''Alcohol, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and CV mortality ('''J curve for chronic consumption) :
** 15-30% reduction in the relative risk of ACS and CV death in chronic drinkers with low to moderate consumption.
** Increased CV risk if consumption exceeds 30-40 g/d<ins>,</ins> in proportion to the dose, risk of toxic dilated heart disease in chronic drinkers with high consumption.
** 40% increase in the relative risk of ACS and CV mortality following acute intoxication (binge drinking).
