*'''Primary cardiovascular prevention:'''
**<Target population:</u> patients with no detectable cardiac or vascular pathology.
**<u>Objectives:</u> to reduce the incidence of proven, fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events (chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ischaemic stroke (iSVA), obliterative arterial disease of the lower limbs (AOMI), mesenteric angina, renovascular hypertension, CV death.
**<Therapeutic management of CV risk factors, the intensity of which depends on each individual's level of CV risk.
*Primary secondary cardiovascular prevention:
**<u>Target population</u>: patients free of clinically detectable cardiac or vascular pathology but with subclinical atheromatous lesions.
**<u>Objectives</u>: to prevent the progression and subsequent clinical expression of subclinical lesions.
**<Means</u>: vigorous therapeutic management of CV risk factors.
*Secondary cardiovascular prevention:
**<u>Target population</u>: patients with a history of a clinical CV event.
**<Objectives</u>: to reduce the risk of recurrence of CV events. Reduce CV morbidity and mortality.
