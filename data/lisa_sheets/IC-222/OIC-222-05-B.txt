*Prevalence (French population):''''
**'''HTA:''' 1 in 3 adults in France, frequency increases with age (5% before age 45 and > 50% after age 65).
**'''Tobacco:''' approximately 25% of the population in 2019, down 4 points since 2016.
**'''Diabetes:''' 4 to 5% of the population, increasing by 5% per year, 90% type 2 diabetes, underestimated by 20% due to lack of diagnosis, prevalence increases with age (prevalence of 20% after 75).
**Dyslipidaemia: about 20% of 18-74 year olds with LDL-c > 1.6 g/L, about 6% of 18-74 year olds with LDL-c > 1.9 g/L.

*'''Associated cardiovascular risk:''''
*'''Associated cardiovascular risk:''' **'''High blood pressure:''' increased relative risk of CV disease: Stroke x 7, MI x 3, OSA x 2.
**'''Smoking:''' increase in relative risk of CV death by a factor of 2.8.
**'''Diabetes:''' increase in relative risk of CV event by a factor of 2.
**'''Dyslipidaemia:''' quasi-linear positive correlation then exponential in the extreme values between LDL-c and the risk of CV event.

*'''Percentage of avoidable cardiovascular pathologies if major modifiable risk factors are managed:''''
**'''High blood pressure:''' a 10 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure and a 5 mmHg reduction in diastolic blood pressure is associated with a 20% relative annual reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease and a 32% relative annual reduction in the risk of stroke.
**Smoking: Smoking cessation reduces the relative risk of CV death by 36% and the relative risk of recurrent MI after an acute coronary event by 32%.
**Diabetes: the impact of intensive glycaemic control on cardiovascular events, particularly in type 2 diabetes, varies according to the study, the method of analysis, the duration of follow-up and the compounds used. In particular, the impact of metformin treatment depends on the population studied and the length of time diabetes has been present, and remains a matter of debate. Recently, two therapeutic classes (SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 analogues) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events, but not exclusively by controlling HbA1c.
**Dyslipidaemia: 20% reduction in the relative risk of a CV event for each 1 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) reduction in LDL cholesterol.


In Europe, ''overall cardiovascular risk'' is assessed in apparently healthy people (primary prevention) by the ''SCORE 2 and SCORE 2-OP scores''. These scores estimate the ''probability of occurrence of a major fatal or non-fatal CV event (death by MI or stroke, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke) over a given period (10 years)''. For France, the "European countries at low cardiovascular risk" or "low CVD risk" scores are used. These scores are based on : gender, smoking, non-HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and age. Diabetes, obesity, coronary heredity, sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity are not included in these scores.
