* '''Prerequisites:'''
** Obesity = body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
** Severe obesity = BMI > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.
** Central obesity (= abdominal obesity = excess visceral adipose tissue) is the phenotype with the highest CV risk, and should be distinguished from diffuse obesity with predominantly subcutaneous fat. Central obesity is defined as a waist circumference > 80 cm in women and > 94 cm in men.
* '''Effect of obesity on CV risk factors:''''
** Increases the risk of hypertension.
** Abdominal obesity (perivisceral fat) increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia and metabolic syndrome.
** Favours a sedentary lifestyle due to difficulty in accessing sporting activities (vicious circle).
* Physiopathological basis of the obesity-HC risk link:''''
** Increased insulin resistance.
** Atherogenic dyslipidaemia" combining hypertriglyceridaemia, hypo-HDL-haemia and an increase in the proportion of small, dense LDL.
** Increased blood pressure.
** Increased systemic inflammation.
