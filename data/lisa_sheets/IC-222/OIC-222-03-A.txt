* Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle promote the development of a clinico-biological entity known as the metabolic syndrome, which constitutes a model of aggregation of risk markers for high cardiovascular risk, including abdominal obesity:
** '''Abdominal obesity''' (defined by a waist circumference > 80 cm in women and > 94 cm in men),
** '''some of the major independent risk factors'' (pre<s>-</s> diabetes or diabetes, BP > 130/85 mmHg),
** a particular lipid profile (hyper<s>-</s>triglyceridaemia, hypo-HDLaemia).
* Physiopathologically, it is the result of '''insulin<s>-</s>resistance.'''
