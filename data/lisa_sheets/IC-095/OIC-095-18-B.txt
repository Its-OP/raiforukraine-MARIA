*Overhang of the intervertebral disc, which is no longer exactly superimposed on the contours of the vertebral plates.
*Several possible topographies:
**In the transverse plane :
***Median
***Posterolateral +++ (compresses the "passing" root, e.g. L5 in the case of posterolateral L4-L5 disc herniation)
***Foraminal (compresses the "exiting" root, e.g. L4 in cases of foraminal L4-L5 disc herniation)
***Extra foraminal (ditto, compresses the "exiting" root)
**In the sagittal plane:
***At the level of the inter-somatic line
***Ascending migration (cranial)
***Downward (caudal) migration
**In relation to the posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL):
***Subligamentary, i.e. contained by the LLP
***Excluded, i.e. trans-ligament migration, through a tear in the LLP
*Hernia appears T1 and T2 hypointense
*Look for ''contact'' or '''compression'' on one or more spinal roots, or even on the entire dural sac and horsetail in the case of a very large hernia:
**Removal/displacement of the root by the hernia
**Removal of peri-radicular epidural fat
**Removal of CSF in the case of a very large hernia compressing the dural sac.
*Systematically look for "good concordance" between "imaging" and "clinical" in terms of lateralization (side) and the root level(s) concerned.
