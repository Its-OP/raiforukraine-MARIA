'''Compression of the fibular nerve at the neck of the fibula:'''

*Compression of the common fibular nerve
*Pain and paresthesias of the anterolateral aspect of the leg + dorsal aspect of the foot and the first 4 toes
*Tinel's sign at the neck of the fibula
*Deficiency of the muscles of the anterolateral compartment of the leg, i.e. long and short fibular muscles (deficit in eversion of the foot), anterior tibial muscle (deficit in dorsal flexion of the foot), extensor muscles of the toes and hallux.
*Etiologies :
**Repetitive strain injuries: favoured by certain professions and prolonged postures (e.g. working in a kneeling position for tilers; sitting cross-legged).
**Synovial cyst → ultrasound or MRI +++

'''Compression of the radial nerve in the humeral groove'' :

*Compression of the radial nerve in its groove on the posterior surface of the humeral shaft.
*Pain +/- paresthesia +/- hypo/anaesthesia on the dorsal surface of the forearm and hand
*Distal" motor impairment, sparing the triceps brachii, with a deficit in the extensor muscles of the carpus and a "swan-necked" hand.
*Aetiologies:
**Traumatic, with fracture of the diaphysis of the humerus.
**Postural (or "lovers' paralysis"): sudden discovery, on waking; prolonged compression of the radial nerve against the humerus, by the partner's head resting directly on the arm.
