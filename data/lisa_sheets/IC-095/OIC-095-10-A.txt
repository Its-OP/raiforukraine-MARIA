'''Carpal tunnel syndrome (= compression of the median nerve by the anterior annular ligament of the carpus, as it travels through the carpal tunnel):''''

*The most common ductal syndrome
*Field:
**Sex ratio = 3 women / 1 man.
**Average age = 50 years
**Microtraumatisms which are conducive to certain professions, e.g. repetitive flexion/extension/rotation movements of the wrist in packaging companies; intense vibrations (jackhammers) in building and public works (BTP); prolonged static pressure on the wrists (taxi drivers, secretaries).
*Bilateral damage in 1/3 of cases
*Acroparesthesia in the sensory territory of the median nerve, i.e. first 3 fingers, lateral edge of the 4th finger and palmar surface of the hand.
*Nocturnal recurrence, or favoured by postures/movements in wrist extension; classic relief by shaking the hand
*In most cases, there is no neurological deficit.
*In advanced forms:
**Hypoesthesia affecting fine prehension, assessed by Weber test (spatial discrimination of 2 points 5 mm apart) or Semmes-Weinstein mono-filaments.
**Muscular weakness of the opposing arm and abductor pollicis brevis of the thumb
**myotrophy of the thenar eminence
*Physical examination: 2 facilitating manoeuvres can trigger the appearance of acroparesthesia, supporting the diagnosis
**Tinel's sign = percussion (using a reflex hammer) of the palmar surface of the wrist in extension (opposite the carpal tunnel)
**Phalen's sign = forced and maintained flexion of the wrists, arms and forearms horizontally

'''Ulnar nerve damage at the elbow (= compression of the ulnar nerve as it travels through the epitrochleo-olecranial groove):''''

*2nd most common canal syndrome, after carpal tunnel syndrome.
*Terrain:
**Balanced sex ratio
**Average age = 50 years
**Microtrauma in certain professions, e.g. repetitive or forced flexion of the elbow; prolonged static pressure on the back of the elbow.
*Acroparesthesia in the sensory territory of the ulnar nerve, i.e. medial edge of the 4th finger, 5th finger and medial edge of the hand.
*More rarely, ascending pain may occur in the forearm.
*Nocturnal recurrence or aggravated by elbow flexion postures/movements.
*Most often, there are no neurological deficits.
*In advanced forms:
**Hypoesthesia in the same territory
**Muscular weakness of the thumb adductor, with "Froment's sign"; and/or of the interosseous muscles, with "crossing sign" (inability to position the middle finger over the index finger).
**myotrophy of the hypothenar eminence, giving a "monkey hand" appearance
**In the final stage, paralysis of the deep common flexor of the 4th and 5th fingers, giving an "ulnar claw" appearance (i.e. extension of P1 and flexion of P2+P3).
*Physical examination: Tinel's sign reproducing acroparesthesia on percussion of the epitrochleo-olecranial groove.
