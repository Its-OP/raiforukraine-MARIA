*Radiculopathy:'''' all the symptoms associated with damage to a spinal root (or nerve).
*'''Plexopathy:''' all symptoms related to the suffering of a plexus (i.e. complex anastomosis of several spinal roots).
*Canal syndrome:''' all the symptoms linked to the suffering of a peripheral nerve in a narrow, inextensible anatomical passage.

*Depending on the functional value (i.e. sensitive, motor, vegetative or mixed) of the nerve structure affected, the symptoms may be varied: pain, paresthesia, hypo/anaesthesia, muscle strength deficit, amyotrophy, genital-sphincter deficits, vaso- and sudomotor disorders.
*It is the systematisation of the symptoms, i.e. their distribution in a precise neuroanatomical territory, which makes it possible to discern a radicular, plexus or truncular attack. This requires a good knowledge of the sensory and motor mapping of the peripheral nervous system (e.g. dermatome / myotome specific to each spinal root).
