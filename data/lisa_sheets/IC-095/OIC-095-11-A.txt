*The positive diagnosis of ductal syndrome is primarily clinical.
**Electro-neuro-myogram (ENMG):
***In case of doubt with peripheral neurogenic involvement of another origin (e.g. radicular) and essential preoperatively.
***Always bilateral and comparative (right/left)
***Measures conduction velocity and amplitude of nerve impulses (comparison with known normative values)
***Detects focal conduction block at the site of compression
***Allows the severity of the damage to be determined:
****Discreet = myelin damage (slowing of conduction velocities)
****Severe = axonal repercussions (loss of amplitude) <br /> **Other complementary examinations only if necessary
**Other complementary examinations only if a secondary form is suspected, e.g. in the context of carpal tunnel syndrome:
***Imaging: X-rays to look for nerve compression and ultrasound by some teams to compare the size of the nerve with the contralateral one.
***if endocrine cause, e.g. hypothyroidism, acromegaly, etc.
