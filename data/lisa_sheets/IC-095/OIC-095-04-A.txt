*Common radiculalgias: (1) Radiculalgia due to herniated disc:  - Mechanism by release of pro-inflammatory substances from the nukleus pulposus (NP) under the effect of mechanical compression of the nerve by the NP - Young subject, mechanical timetable, well-systematised radicular path, coughing impulsivity, Lasègue and bell signs (2) Radiculalgia in a narrowed lumbar canal - Spinal stenosis most often acquired by multiple mechanisms (spondylolisthesis, osteophytes, hypertrophy of the yellow ligaments, disc protrusions, posterior articular osteoarthritis, etc.), Elderly subjects, presence of a reduced walking perimeter with intermittent claudication (pain triggered on walking after a fixed walking distance, rapidly calmed by stopping the activity, and recurring on resumption of walking over the same distance), of radicular type (pain regresses after a few minutes), improving with anteflexion of the spine (caddie sign) and worsening with lordosis - Neuropathic pain with pluriradicular involvement - Differential diagnoses : spinal claudication (fatigue and pyramidal syndrome) or arterial claudication (pain or muscle cramps affecting the calves or sometimes the buttocks) - First-line medical treatment (physiotherapy with delordosis, analgesics and infiltrations), second-line surgery.
*Symptomatic low back pain: manifestations of more severe conditions or requiring specific therapeutic management. Suspected pathologies: metastases, lymphoma, infectious spondylodiscitis, intrarachid tumour, infectious meningoradiculitis, etc.
