In 2012, the ANSM drew up a list of 12 events that should never occur in healthcare establishments. These events, linked to the use of healthcare products, are the equivalent of "never events" in the English-speaking world.

These are :

- Errors in the management of patients treated with anticoagulants

- Errors when administering potassium chloride injection

- Errors in the preparation of injectable specialities for which the method of preparation is at risk

- Errors of administration by intrathecal injection instead of the intravenous route

- Errors of administration by parenteral injection instead of the oral or enteral route

- Overdose of anticancer drugs, particularly in paediatrics

- Errors in the rate of administration of oral methotrexate (outside oncology)

- Insulin administration errors

- Errors in the administration of specialities used in anaesthesia and intensive care in the operating theatre

- Errors in the administration of medical gases

- Errors in the programming of administration devices (infusion pumps, electric syringes, etc.)

- Errors when administering or using small single-dose plastic containers (single-dose saline solution, antiseptic solution, etc.), particularly in maternity wards and paediatric wards.
