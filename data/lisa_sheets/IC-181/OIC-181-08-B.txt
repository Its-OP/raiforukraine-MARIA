The principle of transparency is one of the four main principles of health safety.

It affirms the need for effective communication of health knowledge, whether in terms of information for the general public or exchanges and controversies between scientists, associations and health authorities.

Its aim is to give everyone, in every situation, every opportunity to make the right decisions in the light of current knowledge, and to review these decisions whenever necessary.
