Haemovigilance is one of the health monitoring activities carried out by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM).

This is the continuous process of collecting, identifying, evaluating and investigating potential adverse events occurring throughout the labile blood product transfusion chain, from donor collection to post-transfusion follow-up of the recipient.
