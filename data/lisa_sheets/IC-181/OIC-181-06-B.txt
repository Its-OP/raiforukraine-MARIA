The precautionary principle is one of the four main principles of health safety.

It stipulates that the lack of certainty in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge must not delay the adoption of measures aimed at preventing a priori a risk of serious and irreversible damage to society, at an economically acceptable cost.

In 1998, this principle was used to justify stopping hepatitis B vaccination in secondary schools, because of doubts about a causal link between this vaccination and the occurrence of demyelinating diseases, which turned out to be unfounded.
