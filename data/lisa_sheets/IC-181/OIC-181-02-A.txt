A health crisis is defined in the vigilance glossary (Afssaps 2011) as an unforeseen and complex situation of potential or proven seriousness requiring immediate action with exceptional management resources, most often cross-functional.

It is these successive crises (contaminated blood, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Mediator, etc.) that have guided the construction of the health safety system in France.
