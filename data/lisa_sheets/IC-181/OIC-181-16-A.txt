Identitovigilance is the continuous process of collecting, identifying, evaluating and investigating potential adverse events linked to patient identification errors at all stages of the healthcare process.

It is to limit these undesirable events that patients must wear an identification bracelet when they are hospitalised and that professionals are required to check patients' identity before each act of care.
