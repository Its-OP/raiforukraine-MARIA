Addictovigilance, also known as pharmacodependence, is one of the health monitoring activities handled by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM).

This is the ongoing process of collecting, identifying, assessing and investigating potential adverse events related to the use of psychoactive substances, including narcotics and psychotropic drugs.
