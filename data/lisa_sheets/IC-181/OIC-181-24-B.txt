The Haute Autorité de Santé is an independent public authority whose main role is to ensure the quality of the healthcare system.

Although it is not responsible for regulated vigilance, the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) contributes to health safety through a number of different missions.

In particular, it is responsible for collecting risk events reported by doctors working in high-risk specialties as part of their accreditation process.
