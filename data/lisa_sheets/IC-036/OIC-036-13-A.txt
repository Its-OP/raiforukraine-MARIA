The effectiveness of a contraceptive method is measured by the Pearl index, which is the ratio of the number of unwanted pregnancies per 100 women after 12 months of use.

It is assessed in two ways:

- perfect use (test results) or

- common use ("real life" ''with its risks of forgetfulness'' or malabsorption: digestive disorders ...)
