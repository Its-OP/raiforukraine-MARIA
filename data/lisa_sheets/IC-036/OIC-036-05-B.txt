== '''Mechanisms of action of COP''' ==
'''- Anti-gonadotropic action'' of the progestogen compound principally (amplified by the estrogen suppressing the ovulatory LH peak and inhibiting follicular growth)

'''- Change in cervical mucus''', thicker and less abundant (progestogen compound)

'''- Atrophy of the endometrium'' making it more or less incapable of implantation (progestogen compound)

== '''Mechanisms of action of progestin-only contraception''' ==
'''- Modification of the cervical mucus'' (thick and therefore unsuitable for the passage of spermatozoa), hence the importance of continuous use. This is the main effect

'''- Possible atrophy of the endometrium'', unsuitable for implantation (major for the levonorgestrel IUD)

Reduced tubal mobility

For desogestrel and drospirenone: ''antigonadotropic action,'' which varies from woman to woman

== '''Mechanisms of action of copper intrauterine contraception''' ==
Endometrial inflammatory reaction due to the presence of copper and probable direct sperm toxicity.

== '''Mechanisms of action of emergency contraception''' ==

=== Method using levonorgestrel ===
o ''Interference with peak LH'' and inhibition of ovulation only if prescribed in the pre-ovulatory phase

o '''delays or inhibits follicular growth'''

=== Method using ulipristal acetate ===
o '''inhibition of follicular growth'' in the first part of the cycle

o '''delay or inhibition of the LH peak'''

o ''delayed follicular rupture'' 3 to 5 days after intake, even after the LH peak

=== Method using a copper IUD ====
o '''direct toxic effect of copper on gametes'''

o ''inflammatory'' action on the endometrium, making it unsuitable for implantation
