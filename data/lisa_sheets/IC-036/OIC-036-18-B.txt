A distinction must be made between different clinical situations

=== Women who have had a venous vascular accident and/or women with biological thrombophilia ===''- Contraindication for all estrogen-progestogen contraceptives, regardless of route of administration.
Contraindication of all estrogen-progestogen contraceptives, whatever the route of administration''''

'''- Authorised contraception''' :

* progestin-only contraception (excluding intra-muscular contraception)
* IUDs containing copper or small doses of levonorgestrel.
* Barrier contraception is of course possible, but is less effective.

=== Women who have had an arterial accident (MI, ischaemic stroke) ===
The contraceptive strategy is the same as for venous accidents, but it is preferable to use non-hormonal contraception as a first-line treatment.

=== Women with vascular risk factors ===
the contraceptive strategy for UCCs depends on the type and number of vascular risk factors (summary table below) VRF= Vascular risk factors
