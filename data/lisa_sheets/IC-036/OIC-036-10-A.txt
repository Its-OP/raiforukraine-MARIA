== '''Adverse effects of COP''' ==

=== Major adverse effects ===
- Increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to pharmacologically-induced changes in haemostasis caused by the steroids contained in COPs. This risk exists with ''ALL COP''. Combined 2nd</sup> generation pills containing levonorgestrel are the least at risk compared with all other COPs, including patches and vaginal rings.

 - Increased arterial risk (ischaemic stroke)

 - Modification of ''Glucidic'' ''metabolism'' by a reduction in glucose tolerance leading to a certain degree of insulin resistance.

 - Modification of lipid metabolism: dependent on the hormonal climate of the COP, with an increase in triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

''' -'''' Appearance of '''arterial hypertension''' in around 5% of women.

=== Minor side effects (depend on hormonal climate, wide variability) ===
'''- Cycle disorders''' (more frequent at the start of treatment)

- Digestive disorders (''nausea, vomiting''),

- Mastodynia,

'''- Headaches''',

- Mood disorders

'''- Libido disorders''',

- Skin disorders (acne, hair growth)

- Risk of biliary lithiasis (exceptional)

=== Undesirable effects with long-term use ===
- Very slight increase in the risk of breast cancer

- Very slight increase in the risk of cervical cancer (in HPV+ women).

These undesirable effects are largely offset by other beneficial carcinological effects.

== Undesirable effects of prostate cancer ==
- Menstrual cycle disorders, spotting or amenorrhoea.

- Ovarian dystrophies

- Mastodynia,

- Functional ovarian cysts,

- Acne or hirsutism.
