o certain biological tests required for the prescription or proper monitoring of contraception, no more than once a year

o the dispensing of contraceptives reimbursable on medical prescription

- Secrecy throughout the contraceptive process'' (neither compulsory nor automatic).

The notion of secrecy does not exempt the underage girl from disclosing her identity and age, and presenting her Vitale card (if no Vitale card, exceptional procedure for anonymity).

o for all under-age girls aged 15 and over

o in possession of a medical prescription for the contraceptive marked "minor contraception".

o in order to ensure that the contraceptive is free of charge, the pharmacist must systematically use the exemption code ''EXO 3'', implying no charge for the young girl
