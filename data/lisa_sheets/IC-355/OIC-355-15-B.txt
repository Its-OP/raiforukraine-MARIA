Treatment depends on the cause ([Learn about the diagnosis and aetiologies of haematemesis in children 2C-355-DP-B01]).

In case of oesophagitis or ulcer: administration of PPI and treatment of H pylori if necessary

In the event of swallowed blood from the mother's crevices: care for the mother's crevices, advice on positioning for breastfeeding (poor breast positioning can cause crevices).

In the case of a severe form with haemodynamic repercussions: intensive care with monitor, venous line, filling and possibly transfusion.
