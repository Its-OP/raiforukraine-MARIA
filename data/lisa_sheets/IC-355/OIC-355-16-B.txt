Treatment is based on finding the cause

- fissure on constipation = treatment of constipation (laxatives)

- acute intestinal intussusception: reduction by enema

- Meckel's diverticulum: surgery

In the event of severe haemorrhage with haemodynamic repercussions: intensive care, venous line, filling or even transfusion.
