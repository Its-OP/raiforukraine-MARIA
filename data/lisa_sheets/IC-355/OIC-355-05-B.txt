The first thing to do is to identify haematemesis (fresh (red) or digested (brown) blood when vomiting) from swallowed epistaxis, which is more common in children than haematemesis.

The main causes vary according to age

- newborns: neonatal oesophagitis, swallowing blood from maternal cracks in breast-fed newborns

- infants: swallowing blood from maternal crevices, more rarely oesophagitis

- children: Mallory-Weiss syndrome (ulceration of the oesophagus secondary to vomiting), ulcers and gastritis (particularly post-NSAID or corticosteroid)

Digestive explorations (endoscopy) are justified in cases of suspected oesophagitis or ulcer.
