'''Any digestive haemorrhage requires endoscopic exploration as a first-line treatment'''

A- In the event of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage: an upper endoscopy is performed within 24 hours if the patient is stable, within 12 hours in the event of suspected rupture of oesophageal varices, and as soon as possible in the event of haemodynamic instability, raising fears of active haemorrhage. If the haemorrhage is of high origin, the action to be taken is detailed above.

Specific management of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage:

1) 30 minutes before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for haemorrhage, administer Erythromycin slowly by IV route, in the absence of prolonged QT. This stimulates gastric motricity and allows the stomach to be emptied of clots.

2) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy must be performed under good conditions (ideally under anaesthetic, with orotracheal intubation). Endoscopy confirms the positive diagnosis of upper GI haemorrhage (signs of recent bleeding), locates and determines the cause of the bleeding, and enables haemostatic treatment to be given.

B- In case of lower digestive haemorrhage :

1) Suspicion of haemorrhage of upper origin (red blood with shock), the first step is an upper digestive endoscopy.

If there is a suspicion of a lower-lying origin, the indication for endoscopic exploration is rarely urgent. Depending on the clinical presentation, proctological examination (TR, anuscopy, rectoscopy) or complete colonoscopy under general anaesthetic after preparation is preferred.
