Imaging tests are part of the diagnostic flowchart, but are not first-line tests:


Any digestive haemorrhage should be investigated endoscopically as a first line of defence

See the section on the role of digestive endoscopy. In the vast majority of cases, there is no indication for a cross-sectional imaging examination (CT scan).


The endoscopy should be performed on a patient who is haemodynamically stable.

In case of melena and/or profuse rectal bleeding:  

If upper GI endoscopy does not find a cause for the bleeding, the first two diagnostic options are :

- If the patient is haemodynamically stable (the most frequent case): organise a colonoscopy with optimum preparation (delayed emergency).

- If the patient is not haemodynamically stable (rare case): carry out an emergency abdominopelvic CT scan with early and late arterial times in order to find the source of the bleeding (leakage of contrast product).


In case of rectorrhagia :

- Organising a colonoscopy with optimum preparation (delayed emergency)
