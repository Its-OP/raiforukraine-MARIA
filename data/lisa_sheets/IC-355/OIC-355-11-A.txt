'''In adults'''

1) Confirm the diagnosis of digestive haemorrhage :

- Eliminate differential diagnoses and look for externalized blood. A rectal examination is imperative and has a high diagnostic value in digestive haemorrhage.

- Look for arguments in favour of the main causes, see table above.


2) Search for severity criteria

- Haemodynamic impact is the main criterion of severity: initial shock and/or failure to respond to filling is the most serious criterion. Lipothymia, falls and tachycardia are signs of seriousness.

- The fall in haemoglobinemia in the initial phase. Haemoglobinemia may be normal or may underestimate bleeding.

- Terrain: cardiovascular co-morbidities worsen the prognosis.

- Short-term evolution: haemodynamic instability despite filling or poor transfusion yield (no rise in haemoglobin after transfusion) are criteria of severity.

Please note! The assessed "volume" of extruded blood is a very poor indicator of severity.

 



 

3) Assessing the degree of urgency according to the clinical presentation

 Rectorrhagia with deglobulation / or melena / or haematemesis are always emergencies and require hospitalisation.
Haematemesis / or melena / or rectal bleeding with haemodynamic repercussions are to be considered as of high origin until oeso-gastro-duodenoscopy confirms or refutes this.

 Ductal rectal bleeding without deglobulation or haemodynamic repercussions: the situation is not an emergency and management can be deferred.

 Iron deficiency anaemia: chronic, non-acute anaemia is not necessarily an emergency if it is well tolerated. In the absence of repercussions from anaemia (lipothymia, falls, hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, functional angina), and in the absence of comorbidities, anaemia can be managed on an outpatient basis: intravenous martial supplementation followed by diagnostic investigations: oeso-gastro-duodenal endoscopy with duodenal and gastric biopsies + ileo-coloscopy, if these examinations are negative an endoscopic videocapsule will be performed, and a gynaecological opinion in women. In all other cases, poor tolerance means that the patient must be transfused before being investigated.
