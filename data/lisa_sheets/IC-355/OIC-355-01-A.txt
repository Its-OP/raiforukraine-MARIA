Anatomy distinguishes between high and low causes, depending on whether the bleeding originates above or below the angle of Treitz (duodeno-jejunal).

This anatomical distinction does not correspond to a clinical presentation: an upper digestive bleed can be clinically externalised via the anus (for example, melena is the production of digested blood by the anus, which in 80% of cases is of upper origin).
