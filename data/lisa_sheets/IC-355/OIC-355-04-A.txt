|Title=Knowing the elements of the diagnosis of upper or lower digestive haemorrhage
|Description=Know how to differentiate haematemesis from an extra-digestive cause (haemoptysis, epistaxis) and how to differentiate rectal bleeding from melena. Understand how the presence of melena affects the location of bleeding.

1/ Upper digestive haemorrhage (haematemesis):

- After ruling out differential diagnoses (swallowed epistaxis, haemoptysis)

- Questioning :

- taking medication that is toxic to the digestive mucosa (NSAIDs, aspirin)

- taking anticoagulant medication

- antecedents :

- gastroduodenal surgery

- gastric or duodenal ulcers

- chronic liver disease

- symptoms prior to the haemorrhagic episode :

- dysphagia

- ulcer pain

- Clinical examination :

- Signs of cirrhosis or portal hypertension (collateral venous circulation porto-cava)

- Pain caused by palpation of the epigastric region (tenderness)

- Rectal examination in cases of diagnostic doubt (e.g. when externalization is not observed)


2/ Lower digestive haemorrhage

- Melena (externally or on rectal examination): we look for factors that may point to an aetiological diagnosis, as in the case of haematemesis (see above).

- Haematochezia or rectal bleeding :

o ''Without deglobulation or shock:''

ยง Interrogation :

- intra-renal foreign bodies (e.g. temperature measurement with an intra-rectal thermometer, sexual objects, etc.)

- taking medication that is toxic to the digestive mucosa (NSAIDs, aspirin)

- taking anticoagulant medication

- antecedent of :

o anal pathology (haemorrhoids)

o known diverticulosis

o colorectal cancer or colonic polyp

ยง Clinical examination: hard mass in the rectal ampulla on rectal examination

o ''With deglobulation and/or shock'' :

ยง Look for the same causes as upper GI haemorrhage

ยง The cause is rarely anal, rectal or colonic
