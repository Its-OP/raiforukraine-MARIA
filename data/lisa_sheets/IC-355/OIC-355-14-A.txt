1) Emergency measures :

If urgent and/or serious (see above): hospitalisation and immediate prescriptions:

*Diagnostics: Biological work-up with CBC, Rh group RAI, haemostasis (PT, aPTT), blood ionogram, creatinine, discuss blood gases depending on clinical condition.

*Therapeutics:

General measures: admit the patient to a specialised unit (intensive care unit or resuscitation unit). Perfusion with a good calibre venous line, oxygen therapy, continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, filling and transfusion according to haemodynamics and haemoglobinaemia.

*If there is a suspicion of upper GI haemorrhage, because of the frequency of the main causes, portal hypertension and ulcer, intravenous treatments can be started before the GI endoscopy: proton pump inhibitor (PPI) electric syringe and/or vasoactive treatment (octreotide, somatostatin or terlipressin) as detailed below.

*The recommended target haemoglobin level is debated in cases of upper GI haemorrhage. The recommendations are to achieve a haemoglobin level of 7 to 9 gr/dl, with a higher threshold in the case of cardiovascular co-morbidities above 9 gr/dl. In the case of ruptured oesophageal varices, the threshold is 7 to 8 gr/dl.


2) Specific management of haemorrhage other than that associated with portal hypertension

   - Oesogastroduodenal endoscopy allows haemostasis procedures to be performed.

   - IVSE proton pump inhibitors: it is recommended that they be started before the endoscopic procedure.


3) Specific management of haemorrhage associated with portal hypertension :

- Endoscopic mechanical haemostasis: ligation of oesophageal varices and/or glue sclerosis of gastric varices

- Reduction in splanchnic blood flow to reduce the porto-cava pressure gradient: vasoactive treatment (octreotide, somatostatin or terlipressin) intravenously.

- Prevention of infections (swallowing pneumonia, ascites) by antibiotic prophylaxis for 5 to 7 days (3rd generation cephalosporin)


ïƒ¨ In the event of haemorrhage caused by uncontrollable rupture of oesophageal or gastric varices, nasal catheters or balloon tamponades (Blakemore or Linton catheters) can be inserted. These are life-saving procedures while awaiting other treatments. It is also possible to fit a liver prosthesis to relieve portal hypertension (shunt between the portal system and the vena cava = TIPS (Transjugular Intra Hepatic Portosystemic Shunt)).


4) Prevention of recurrent haemorrhage

Secondary prevention of ruptured oesophageal varices: There are two treatments to be combined

- Eradication of oesophageal varices by iterative ligation until they disappear

- Combined with non-cardio selective beta blockers

- Discuss preventive TIPS (Child C or Child B patients with active bleeding on endoscopy during the haemorrhagic episode)

Prevention of recurrence of ulcer haemorrhage:

- Eradicate Helicobacter pylori (Hp) if the ulcer lesion is linked to Hp.

- Stopping gastrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs) in Hp-negative ulcers
