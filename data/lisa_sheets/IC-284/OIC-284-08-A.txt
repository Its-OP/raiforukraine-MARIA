Therapy is patient-centred. The most important stage in the disease is therapeutic education. The first step is to make the diagnosis, because putting a name to the symptoms is the first step in justifying and organising treatment. The fact that clinical and paraclinical tests are normal is often not enough to reassure the patient. The benign nature of the disease needs to be explained, along with the chronicity of the symptoms. Time must be taken to explain the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms (alteration of the intestine-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal motor disorders and intestinal dysbiosis) and the various treatment options. The aim of this approach is to avoid medical nomadism. The doctor-patient relationship is fundamental. To achieve this, the doctor must listen to the patient's expectations and questions, and avoid inaccurate and vexatious statements such as "There's nothing wrong with you" or "It's all in your head".

           When a doctor prescribes treatment, it is important to set reasonable targets for the patient. The efficacy of treatments is often uncertain and does not lead to a cure. The aim is to improve symptoms in order to improve quality of life. It is important to plan the assessment of treatment efficacy so as not to miss any warning signs that may warrant a colonoscopy.

           Medicinal treatments (table 1) are based on the prescription of antispasmodics and transit regulators in the first instance. In the second line, treatments such as certain diets, probiotics or hypnosis may also be used. Psychological treatment, or even antidepressants, may also be used. It should be explained that the target is not a mood disorder, but digestive symptoms, particularly abdominal pain.

           As far as dietary management is concerned, simple dietary hygiene advice is offered as a first line of defence (3 meals a day, eat slowly, avoid excessively fatty foods, etc.). When these measures are already respected or are insufficient, patients can be offered a diet low in Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAPs) over a period of 4 to 8 weeks. This diet eliminates malabsorbed carbohydrates and often results in improved digestive comfort. It is useful for this diet to be supervised by a dietician.
