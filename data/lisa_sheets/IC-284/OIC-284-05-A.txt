The presence of certain symptoms known as clinical warning signs should prompt a colonoscopy to rule out organic causes.

- Symptoms appear after the age of 50;

- Blood in the stools (rectorrhagia or melena);

- Nocturnal symptoms;

- Weight loss;

- Recent onset or modification of symptoms;

- Terrain at risk of colonic neoplasia (family history of colorectal cancer see item 301).

These factors must therefore be systematically investigated during questioning. If an abnormality is found on abdominal physical examination, including a digital rectal examination in forms with constipation, or if there is resistance to the proposed medical treatment, colonoscopy is also indicated.
