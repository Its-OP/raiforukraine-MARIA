Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (formerly functional colopathy) is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of abdominal pain associated with transit disorders in the absence of any organic digestive disease. By definition, all complementary tests are normal. It is a benign but chronic pathology with a significant deterioration in quality of life.


There are 4 subtypes of IBS, depending on the predominant transit.

           - IBS with predominant diarrhoea (IBS-D),

           - IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C)

           - IBS with alternating diarrhoea and constipation (IBS-A)

           - IBS indeterminate (IBS-I), for patients who do not fall into any of the 3 subgroups
