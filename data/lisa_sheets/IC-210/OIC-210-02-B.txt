Pneumoconiosis is a lung disease caused by chronic inhalation of mineral dust. They are mainly represented by silicosis (chronic inhalation of silica) and asbestosis (chronic inhalation of asbestos fibres).

The search for exposure to mineral dusts during questioning is therefore essential. Exposure is most often occupational, and can therefore be the subject of a declaration of occupational disease, but exposure can also be domestic.

The clinical presentation is aspecific.

In a suggestive context, thoracic imaging, especially CT scans, can be used to suspect the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.

* Silicosis gives rise to micronodular interstitial anomalies, more or less coalescent, which predominate in the upper parts of the thorax. Calcified "eggshell" adenopathies may be associated.
* Asbestosis gives rise to interstitial abnormalities predominating in the subpleural and at both bases, with centrilobular micronodules and branching opacities, curved subpleural lines, ground-glass opacities and even honeycomb images. Calcified pleural plaques may be associated.

Testing for mineral particles in invasive samples (BAL or lung biopsy) can help with the diagnosis.
