Diffuse infiltrative/interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) refers to a large number of diseases of varying aetiologies that result in diffuse infiltrative abnormalities on lung parenchymal imaging. The thoracic CT scan plays a vital role in characterising the elementary radiological lesions and orienting the diagnosis.

They can be acute, sub-acute or chronic.
