Acute IDP''' requires elimination of :

*Infections: blood cultures, antigenuria, nasopharyngeal swab (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, other viruses), sputum or even BAL, particularly if the patient is immunocompromised (to check for pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis).
*Heart failure: ECG, BNP, echocardiography and therapeutic diuretic test.
*Pulmonary embolism: with a possible D-dimer assay.

Sub-acute and chronic PID require general and then more targeted assessments depending on the clinical, radiobiological and even anatomopathological synthesis:

*Blood biology: CBC/platelets, blood ionogram, creatininaemia, liver function tests, CK, BNP, CRP, plasma protein electrophoresis, possibly IgG subclass assay, serum precipitin assay, ACE, blood calcium, calciuria, NAA, RF, anti-CCP, ANCA, possibly myositis or scleroderma, complement assay, anti-DNA antibodies, HIV serology;
*Arterial gasometry: to assess the degree of hypoxaemia, or even hypercapnia.
