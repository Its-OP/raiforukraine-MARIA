Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HPP) is a disease caused by the acute or chronic inhalation of antigens, which may be microbes, proteins, chemicals or metals. The classic historical forms are represented by "bird-farmer's lung", mainly linked to exposure to droppings, and "farmer's lung", mainly linked to exposure to mouldy hay.

It is therefore essential to investigate exposure to organic or inorganic dusts on questioning. Exposure may be occupational, in which case a claim for occupational disease may be made, or domestic (pet bird, mould in the home, etc.).

This exposure can be confirmed by the positivity of serum precipitins (IgG) directed against the inhaled antigen. This is simply a confirmation of exposure, but the certainty of PHS.

The clinical presentation is aspecific. However, the presence of "squeaks" on auscultation confirms bronchiolar involvement and may help in the diagnosis of PHS.

In a suggestive context, thoracic imaging, especially CT scans, can lead to a suspected diagnosis of PHS. There are two distinct forms:

* A non-fibrosing form characterised by the presence/association on chest CT of ground-glass opacity, mosaic attenuation, centrilobular micronodules and air trapping, with these lesions predominating in the upper parts of the lung; and
* A fibrosing form characterised by pulmonary fibrosis that is not predominant in the bases, associated with centrilobular micronodules, mosaic attenuation, a 3-density appearance or air trapping.

Frank hyperlymphocytosis on BAL is also an element of orientation.

Lung biopsy is sometimes necessary to differentiate chronic fibrosing PHS from other forms of fibrosing IPD (IPF, NIPS, etc.).
