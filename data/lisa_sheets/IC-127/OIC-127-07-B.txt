*'''Total PSA:'''' Not systematic in 1st intention because it does not diagnose BPH''', but'''' can detect [[Prostate tumours|prostate cancer 310]]. Screening is carried out on an individual basis and should be assessed according to the context (patient's age, life expectancy) and with the patient's agreement.

*''''[[Elevated creatinine level|Creatinine level 258]] and measurement of glomerular filtration rate (MDRD, CKD-epi):'''' If risk factors or clinical signs suggestive of chronic renal failure in adults and children|renal failure 264]]. Its measurement is optional in the absence of bladder repercussions of BPH.

=='''Renal, bladder and prostate ultrasound:'''==

*<Ultrasound of the upper urinary tract: to look for dilatation of the pyelocalic cavities and thinning of the renal parenchyma. This is optional in the absence of bladder repercussions of BPH.
*<Bladder ultrasound</u>: to look for signs of a struggling bladder (thick bladder walls with diverticula) or a complication of BPH (bladder lithiasis, diverticulum, detrusor hypertrophy, post-micturition residue) and to assess the post-micturition residue. It is optional in the absence of bladder repercussions from BPH''''''''.
*<Suspubital ultrasound of the prostate</u>: to look for a median lobe. Suspubital ultrasound allows assessment of prostatic volume, but has no place in the detection of a prostatic tumour.

*'''Uretro-cystoscopy:''' This examination is only carried out in cases of diagnostic doubt in search of urethral stricture or [[Bladder tumours|bladder tumour 314]] in the presence of [[Haematuria|haematuria 260]]. It is carried out by a urologist. It is an invasive examination of 2nd<sup>intention</sup>.
*''''[[Urination disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|Urodynamic assessment 125]]:''''' This examination is only carried out in the event of discordant symptoms or in the context of neurological disease (diabetic/alcoholic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, etc.) in search of detrusor hypotonia. The flow-pressure curve can be used to differentiate between subvesical obstruction and detrusor hypotonia. This is a 2nd line invasive examination carried out by a specialist.
*'''Voiding schedule:''' it is indicated in cases of disabling symptoms of the storage phase or suspected polyuria ([[Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications|diabetes mellitus 247]], sleep apnoea, [[Adult heart failure|heart failure 234]], potomania...)
