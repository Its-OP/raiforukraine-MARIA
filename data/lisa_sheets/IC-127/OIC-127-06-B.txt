==The paraclinical investigations to be carried out as a first-line assessment of BPH are:==

*''ECBU:''' is used to test for [[Haematuria|a haematuria 260]], [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|urinary tract infection 161]] (differential diagnoses of BPH).

<br />

*Flowmetry:''' is used to identify urinary disorders and incontinence in adults and the elderly|dysuria 125]]. The key parameters in its interpretation are the maximum flow rate and the shape of the curve.
**A urine volume >150mL provides a more reliable assessment.
**A maximum flow rate < 15ml/s is considered pathological.
**A normal curve is bell-shaped, whereas a flat curve indicates an emptying disorder.

*Post-micturition residue: the presence of a significant quantity of urine (more than 100ml) in the bladder after micturition. It is assessed using ultrasound or a device such as Bladder ScanÂ©.

A post-micturition residue is not in itself an indication for surgery, especially as a residue may be linked to subvesical obstruction or bladder hypoactivity.
