==Situations justifying a specialist opinioń according to the Association Française d'Urologie==

*SBAU a priori unrelated to BPH: patient < 50 years, isolated urgency, isolated nocturia, urinary incontinence, particular context (neurological disease, known urethral stenosis, unbalanced diabetes mellitus, etc.), haematuria with risk factor for urothelial cancer (tobacco, profession, etc.).
*Anomaly on clinical examination: palpable globe, nodule or induration on rectal examination (or rectal examination not possible), tight phimosis.

*'''Abnormal ECBU'' (bacteriuria, leucocyte or haematuria).
*Ineffective medical treatment (specialist advicé is recommended before starting anticholinergic treatment).
*'''Increased PSA'''
*'''Severe obstruction or occurrence of a complication'' (severe symptoms, acute urine retention, obstructive renal failure, acute prostatitis, bladder stone or diverticulum, post mictional residue > 100 ml).
