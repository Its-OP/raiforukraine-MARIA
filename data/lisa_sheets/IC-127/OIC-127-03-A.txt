==Acute complications of BPH warrant immediate therapeutic management ==

*Acute urinary retention 347]''' must be suspected in the presence of hypogastric pain and an inability to micturate on questioning and the presence of a bladder globe<s>e</s> on clinical examination. It requires urgent urine diversion, by bladder catheterisation or suprapubic catheterisation. Alpha-blocker treatment should be started immediately. Failure to resume micturition after removal of the catheter or clamping of the catheter warrants surgical management.

*BPH may be complicated by a [[Urinary tract infections in children and adults|'''urinary tract infection''''161]] of the acute prostatitis or orchi-epididymitis type. It should be suspected in the presence of an exacerbation of SBAU, urinary burning and fever. On examination, the rectum is painful in the case of acute prostatitis, while orchi-epididymitis presents as an inflamed and swollen [[Genito-scrotal pathology in boys and men|inflammatory swelling 50]] on examination of the external genitalia. Urinary infection is confirmed by ECBU. It requires hospitalisation if there are signs of poor tolerance. It should be treated with a probabilistic antibiotic (quinolone) in the first instance, then adapted according to the antibiogram.

*[[Haematuria|'''Macroscopic haematuria'''' 260]] may complicate BPH. BPH can only be considered as an aetiology once other causes have been ruled out, in particular [[Bladder tumours|Urothelial carcinoma 314]] or kidney tumours 311, [[calculi 265]] which should be investigated by uro CT scan and bladder fibroscopy. The presence of clots with [[Acute retention of urine|urinary retention 347]] (bladder clotting) requires the insertion of a large-calibre dual-current bladder catheter for decalcification with lavage.

*Acute renal failure linked to the subvesical obstruction of BPH should be suspected in the presence of back pain, oedema, nausea, reduced diuresis or anuria. Renal failure is confirmed by measuring creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate, and the aetiology by renal-vesicoprostatic ultrasound (dilatation of the renal cavities). It is initially treated by emergency urinary diversion with monitoring of the obstruction removal syndrome, followed by surgical management of the BPH.
