=='''Abstention-surveillance:'''==
For patients with uncomplicated BPH (acute or chronic retention, renal failure, calculi, infection) and minimal or moderate SBAU with no impairment of quality of life (IPSS score < 9).

*There is a low risk of complications in BPH that is correctly monitored.
*Patients should be informed that BPH is benign.
*Clear explanations about BPH should be given to the patient, as this can lead to significant improvement in UABS.
*Hygienic dietary advice (insufficient to alter the natural history of the disease) has a moderate impact on the evolution of symptoms.

=='''Pharmacological treatments:'''==
For patients with uncomplicated BPH and moderate to severe LUTS (IPSS score >9)

*<Phytotherapy:</u> **Their mode of action remains unknown.
**Their mode of action remains unknown
**Well tolerated
**Lower level of recommendation than other pharmacological classes.
*<Alpha-receptor blockers
*Improves urinary flow by relaxing the smooth muscles of the prostate and bladder neck.
**Rapid and stable action over time
**Undesirable effects: orthostatic hypotension, [[Genital-scrotal pathology in boys and men|anejaculation 58]]
**In cases of urinary retention, prescription of alpha-blockers 48 hours before attempting to remove the bladder catheter improves the chances of successfully resuming good quality micturition.
*<5α-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)</u>.
**Proposed to patients with bothersome SBAU (IPSS > 8) with a prostatic volume >40ml
**Blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone
**Improves urinary output by reducing prostate volume, resulting in a 50% reduction in PSA after 6 months.
**Take effect over several months
**May be used as a second-line treatment after failure of monotherapy with phytotherapy or alpha-blockers.
**Undesirable effects: erectile dysfunction, asthenia.
**The 5 ARIs are thought to increase the risk of high-risk prostate cancer.
*<Combination of alpha-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors</u>.
**Therapy more effective than either treatment alone.
**Adverse effects of the 2 treatments combined.
**Recommended in the event of ineffectiveness of treatments taken as monotherapy.
*<Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (tadalafil)
**May be offered to patients with bothersome LUTS who also have erectile dysfunction.
**Undesirable effects: hot flushes.
**Cardiological opinion should be sought in patients who are not very active or who have cardiovascular risk factors.
*<Anticholinergics</u>.
**In combination with an alpha-blocker in the event of persistent storage symptoms under alpha -blocker.
**Contraindicated in cases of post-micturition residue > 150ml and untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma.
**Undesirable effects: constipation, dry mouth, worsening of dysuria, cognitive disorders (elderly subjects).

=='''Surgical treatment:'''==
For patients with complicated BPH (acute urine retention, bladder lithiasis, recurrent haematuria of prostatic origin, [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children|chronic obstructive renal failure 264]], [[Urinary infections in children and adults|recurrent infections 161]]) or moderate to severe UABS resistant to maximal medical treatment.

*Allow removal of subvesical obstruction
*<u>Ablative treatments:</u>
**Transurethral resection of the prostate (mono or bi-polar) (prostatic volume <80cc)
**Endoscopic enucleation of prostate adenoma (lasers, bi-polar resector) (No prostate volume limit)
**Prostate vaporisation (lasers, bi-polar resectorator) (No prostate volume limit)
**Prostatic adenomectomy by suprapubic laparotomy (prostatic volume >80cc)
*<Non-ablative treatments:</u> **Cervico-prostatic incision
**Cervico-prostatic incision (prostatic volume <30cc)
**Urethral implants (Urolift®) (prostate volume <80cc)

==All these treatments to relieve BPH obstruction carry risks of:==

*urinary incontinence
*retrograde ejaculation
*urinary tract infections
*urethral stricture
