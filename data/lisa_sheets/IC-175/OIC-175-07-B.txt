- Feco-oral parasitosis

Faecal peril is linked to the contamination of the environment and foodstuffs by excreta. Preventive measures are therefore based on

- <u>basic hygiene</u>: wash your hands frequently (hydro-alcoholic gels are ineffective on parasites) and avoid putting them to your mouth, avoid shaking hands and touching handrails

- <u>food hygiene</u>: drink sealed bottled water, no ice cubes in drinks, avoid raw vegetables (unless carefully washed with boiled or filtered water...), prefer cooked dishes (destruction of eggs/cysts), wash/peel fruit before eating, do not leave dishes in the open air or cover them.

In endemic areas, prevention is based on health education, building toilets and treating excreta, stopping the use of human fertilisers in agriculture, and mass treatment of the population.

- Transcutaneous parasitosis

<u>Schistosomiasis</u>: Avoid bathing in freshwater (river inlets, ponds, lakes), and freshwater activities (laundry, washing up, walking...).

<Anguillulosis and hookworms</u>: Wear shoes to avoid contact with contaminated damp ground. Similarly, do not sit or lean on the ground.

<u>Animal parasites (''larva migrans'' cutaneous)</u> can also be contracted transcutaneously if the ground is contaminated by faeces (particularly dog faeces). It is advisable to lie down on a towel or mat at the beach or for a picnic.
