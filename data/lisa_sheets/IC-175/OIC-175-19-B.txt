1 Parasitic etiologies

- <u>Cutaneous leishmaniasis</u>: injection of protozoan parasites of the genus ''Leishmania'' during the. The parasites develop in the macrophages at the site of inoculation, inducing a lesion whose appearance and prognosis may vary depending on the parasite species. Healing can sometimes be spontaneous in several months, but lymphangitic or metastatic extensions are to be feared, particularly in South America or in immunocompromised patients. Scarring is often indelible, depending on the treatment (rapid or delayed) and the species.

- <u>Larbish</u>: transcutaneous penetration of dog helminth larvae most often (faeces soiling the ground or beaches), encouraged by walking barefoot or resting on the ground. The larvae are in a parasitic dead end and migrate erratically (larva migrans) close to their site of penetration, then die within a few weeks. They are responsible for intense pruritus.

- <u>Scabies</u>: cosmopolitan, scabies is transmitted by direct skin contact or contact with infected objects (bedding, towels). (see item 171).

'''2.      Fungal etiologies'''

- <u>Cutaneous and mucosal mycoses</u>: these can be promoted by heat and contact between humans or with animals, more rarely a skin break. Dermatophytes, yeasts and also exotic mycosis agents may be involved.
