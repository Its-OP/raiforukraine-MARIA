Populations and situations at risk

All travellers to tropical countries are at risk of acquiring an endemic infection, as well as everyday accidents/illnesses (trauma, road accidents, cardiac or vascular accidents, animal bites, dehydration, etc), the failure or delay of which can have serious consequences. Particularly at risk are itinerant travellers, the elderly, the immunocompromised, people with chronic illnesses, pregnant women and emigrants returning to their native country (where the risk of malaria is underestimated). Young children should be particularly vigilant.<blockquote><u>'''<big>The main situations at risk are:</big>'''</u>

- long-term stays (> 1 month) and "non-group" trips

- camping or bivouac accommodation (exposure to insect bites, water quality) or in a local family environment (particularly rural)

- lack of anti-malarial prophylaxis

- eating raw vegetables, drinks without caps or with ice cubes

- risky sexual behaviour

- swimming in fresh water and walking barefoot

- daily contact with the local population

- vaccinations not up to date (compulsory and recommended)</blockquote>.

===''Destinations at risk''===
<blockquote>- All intertropical zone except Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia (very low risk)

- It should be noted that predominantly tropical infections can also be acquired in Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and the North Pacific.

- '''High global risk:''' Africa, India, South-East Asia, South America

- Risk of malaria: Africa (80% of imported cases diagnosed in France), India, Amazon basin, South-East Asia

- '''Risk of haemorrhagic fevers''': Africa

- ''Risk of arboviroses'': Africa, Amazon basin, South-East Asia, Pacific, West Indies

- '''Risk of tuberculosis''': Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia

- '''Risk of helminthosis''': the entire intertropical belt (and beyond)</blockquote>
