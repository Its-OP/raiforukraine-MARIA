Any fever occurring within 3 months of returning from a malaria-endemic area should be investigated as a matter of urgency (regardless of the associated clinical signs, even if an alternative diagnosis is probable or confirmed).

Malaria is the leading cause of fever in this context, and requires specific treatment to be introduced as a matter of urgency. Any delay in treatment could result in death.

Dengue fever is the second most common cause of fever after returning from a tropical zone. The incubation period generally does not exceed 7 days. Like the other common arboviroses (chikungunya, zika), its range encompasses the entire intertropical zone.

There are many other possible causes, including :

*Cosmopolitan diseases: infectious (pyelonephritis, pneumonia, influenza, leptospirosis, HIV, etc.) or non-infectious (thromboembolic, inflammatory, neoplastic).
*Tropical infectious diseases, the epidemiology of which depends on the region visited.

The diagnostic approach is guided above all by the interview, which must systematically seek to clarify :

*Conditions of stay: countries and localities visited, dates of arrival and departure, living conditions.
*Activities that put you at risk: contact with fresh water, food, human-to-human contact (especially sexual contact), contact with animals.
*Vaccination status.
*Personal anti-vector protection measures.
*Any antimalarial chemoprophylaxis taken (if staying in a malaria-endemic area).
*Chronology of symptoms (fever and associated signs).

Together with a physical examination, this will help to identify the syndromic clinical presentation, which is an essential prerequisite for an aetiological diagnosis.
