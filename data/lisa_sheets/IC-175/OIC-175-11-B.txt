Analysis of the thermal curve is a good guide when it shows a recurrent fever, suggestive of certain forms of malaria (third or fourth fever) or of borreliosis (borreliosis of recurrent fevers, not Lyme).

Conversely, most viruses, including arboviruses (dengue, chikungunya, zika, etc.) and typhoid fever (3rd septennium), are characterised by a plateau fever.
