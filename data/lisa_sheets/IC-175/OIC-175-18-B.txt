1. examination

It aims to clarify :

- the circumstances of the stay (type of accommodation, group or isolated, duration, contact with local populations), any exposure (swimming, activities, barefoot walking, insect bites, contact with animals, etc)

- the date of appearance of the lesions in relation to the return or a triggering situation

- associated clinical signs (fever, pruritus, digestive signs, etc.)

- the presence of similar clinical signs in close contacts


'''2.      Diagnostic procedures according to the type of lesion'''

- Ulcerated lesion: suggest a bacterial infection (pyoderma) or cutaneous leishmaniasis: take a sample for bacteriological cultures and scrape the inflammatory peripheral edge of the lesion with a scalpel (or punch) to look for leishmania (direct examination and PCR).

- Crusty lesion: on the basis of the history, suggest cutaneous leishmaniasis and take a sample after removing the crust (see above).

- Very pruritic papules, vesicles (+/- scratching lesions): look for furrows and take a scabies sample (look for sarcoptes) and/or examine with a dermoscope to see the sarcoptes. Bedbug bites, which are increasingly common in all types of accommodation throughout the world (gîtes and luxury hotels), should also be considered.

- Dry or scaly circinate lesions, even inflammatory lesions with small vesicles at the peripheral edge: take a sample for mycological cultures to look for dermatophytes.

- Mobile purplish-pink serpiginous cord: no sampling, suggests cutaneous "larva migrans" (feet +++, buttocks, arms) or "larva currens" (buttocks, abdomen, look for anguillulosis).
