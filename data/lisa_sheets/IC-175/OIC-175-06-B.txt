The diagnosis of hepatitis A is based on the detection of IgM antibodies, which are present from the icteric phase and disappear 8 to 12 weeks later. IgG antibodies persist and indicate immunity acquired for life, either after an infection (immunising disease) or after vaccination.

IgG or total antibody testing is recommended before vaccination in people with a significant risk of previous exposure to the hepatitis A virus: people born before 1945, people who have lived in endemic areas, people with a history of jaundice.
