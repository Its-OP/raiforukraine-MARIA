Knowledge of the usual incubation periods can help guide the aetiological diagnosis.

'''Short incubation period: < 7 days'''

- Infectious diarrhoea (Shigellosis, Salmonellosis minor, Cholera)

- Arboviroses (Yellow fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika)

'''Incubation between 7 and 14 days'''

- Malaria,

- Typhoid

- Borreliosis, Leptospirosis, Rickettsial disease

- HIV

'''Long incubation > 14 days'''

- Malaria,

- Viral hepatitis

- Amoebose

- Bilharzia

In most cases, it is only possible to establish a range for the assumed incubation period, based on the dates of entry to and exit from the country or countries visited and the date of onset of symptoms.

This information, combined with a meticulous clinical-biological syndromic approach, enables us to narrow down the field of possible diagnoses.

For example:

*A fever associated with an algo-syndrome (headache, myalgias, arthalgias) and eruption (maculo-papular exanthema) occurring less than 7 days after returning from a tropical zone is highly suggestive of an arbovirosis such as dengue.
*A fever associated with an algesic syndrome (headaches, myalgias, arthalgias), digestive disorders (nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea) and jaundice occurring more than two weeks after returning from a destination in sub-Saharan Africa should raise the diagnosis of malaria as a first step. In unvaccinated patients, acute viral hepatitis A may also be suspected.
*A dysenteric syndrome without fever occurring several months after returning from a tropical destination should raise the suspicion of acute intestinal amoebosis (amoebic colitis).
