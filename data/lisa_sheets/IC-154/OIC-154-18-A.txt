Individual and collective prevention of the transmission of infectious agents involved in lower respiratory infections (essentially viruses and intracellular bacteria excluding Legionella) is based on :

*''''' For outpatients
**Time off work
**Rest at home
**Hygiene: covering the mouth and nose when coughing, single-use tissues in a closed bin, hand washing, recommendation to wear a mask when leaving home.
*'''For hospitalised or institutionalised patients:''''
**Hospitalization in an individual room with additional respiratory precautions depending on the agent involved (e.g. "droplet" precautions for influenza; "air" precautions for tuberculosis).
**Hygiene: covering the mouth and nose when coughing, single-use tissues in a closed bin, recommendation that the patient wear a mask when leaving the room, hand washing or friction with hydro-alcoholic solution, disinfection of surfaces.
