'''Main infectious agents responsible for acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP):'''

CAPs account for around 500,000 cases per year (excluding influenza and COVID-19).


'''''- Streptoccocus pneumoniae''''' (pneumococcus):

- Pathogen most frequently found in hospitalised CAP

- Typically responsible for acute frank lobar pneumonia (AFLP)

- No human-to-human contamination

- Pneumonia with a potentially rapid and severe course: it should always be considered in the probabilistic treatment of severe CAP.



'''''2-''''' '''''Mycoplasma pneumoniae''''' '''and "atypical germs" (intracellular)''' '':'''

- 2<sup>th </sup> in terms of frequency

- Causes CAP, preferentially affecting young adults; epidemics

- Slightly marked respiratory picture, associated with extra-thoracic signs: ENT signs, flu-like syndrome, skin rash, etc.

- Radiological appearance: multi-focal opacities


'''''3- Legionella spp''''' (legionellosis)

- 3<sup>th</sup> in terms of frequency (does not concern children)

- Occurs after high-risk exposure (contaminated water or aerosols), usually in vulnerable individuals. There is no human-to-human contamination, but cluster cases are possible (exposure to the same source).

- Typically rapidly progressive with marked respiratory and infectious signs. Pulse/temperature frequently dissociated; extra-thoracic signs present (no ENT signs, but digestive and neurological signs).

- Causes potentially severe CAP: must be systematically taken into account in the probabilistic treatment of severe CAP. Notifiable disease

- Radiological appearance: systematised condensation(s) or confluent multi-focal opacities

- Notifiable disease


4- Respiratory viruses

- Represent nearly a quarter of the agents responsible for CAP (before the COVID-19 pandemic in adults), frequently implicated in children (RSV, influenza, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus).

- Combine respiratory signs and flu-like symptoms

- Variable severity depending on the terrain and virus responsible


A special case of "SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia" (COVID-19), which has been evolving in a pandemic mode since the beginning of 2020:

- Initial flu-like symptoms ;

- Frequent extra-respiratory symptoms including ENT (anosmia, dysgeusia), digestive, cutaneous (pseudo-engelure) and ocular signs;

- The course of the disease varies widely, from the absence of symptoms to ARDS;

- Radiological appearance: non-systematised areas of ground glass, predominantly subpleural, progressing to condensation.

- Effective vaccination, rolled out worldwide from early 2021.


A special case of 'flu:

- Due to "Myxovirus influenzae", mainly types A and B

- Evolves through seasonal epidemics, affecting 2 to 8 million people each year in France and causing 10 to 15,000 deaths per year.

- Initial symptoms: sudden flu-like illness, and respiratory signs: dry cough

- Severe form possible, especially in fragile subjects: the elderly and infants, diabetics, immunocompromised subjects, subjects with chronic cardiovascular or respiratory co-morbidities, etc.

- Radiological appearance: non-systematised bilateral reticular or reticulo-nodular opacities, sometimes confluent in the hilar region

- Possible bacterial superinfections: pneumococcus; Staphyloccocus aureus; Haemophilus influenzae


Special case of infant pleuropulmonary staphylococcal disease:

- due to Staphylococcus aureus

- respiratory or haematogenous route of entry

- rare, but often severe

- Necrotizing form with appearance of bullae on chest X-ray


'''Main infectious agents responsible for bronchiolitis:''''

Bronchiolitis mainly affects young children (< 2 years), and is mainly caused by the respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), which is responsible for 50 to 80% of cases during epidemics:

*Initial picture: ENT signs
*Frequent progression to bronchiolitis (in 2-3 days), with signs of respiratory struggle and auscultatory abnormalities (wheezing, crackles).
*Severe forms may occur, especially in :
**young infants (< 2 months);
**immunodepression
**prematurity
**cardiac or pulmonary co-morbidity

Other viruses involved include influenza viruses (A and B), adenoviruses, human metapneumoviruses, rhinoviruses, etc.

'''Main infectious agents responsible for bronchitis:'''

Bronchitis is very common (around 10 million cases per year in France). They are viral in origin in 90% of cases (rhinovirus, influenza, para-influenza, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, etc).
