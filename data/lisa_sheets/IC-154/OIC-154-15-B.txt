Treatment of acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be systematically reassessed at 48-72 hours.

If symptoms persist or worsen, the outcome is unfavourable.


'''Unfavourable evolution'''

*In adults
**In ambulatory patients:
***switch antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin â†” macrolide), and hospitalisation is indicated in the event of the 2nd<sup>th</sup> failure.
**in a hospitalised patient: look for the cause of antibiotic failure:
***''a complication has arisen'': pleurisy, abscess, retention pneumonia ;
***a complication has arisen: pleurisy, abscess, retention pneumonia; - poor compliance
***there is a problem with absorption or diffusion of the antibiotic
***''the germ is outside the spectrum of antibiotic therapy'': resistant germ, BK, pneumocystis ;
***it's not CAP'': depending on the context, think of pulmonary embolism, a systemic disease in flare-up, cancer, a fungal infection, etc.
***the fever has another cause: venitis, urinary tract infection, thromboembolic complication, associated neoplasia, etc.

*In children: "ambulatory CAP":
**look for complications
**check compliance
**consider switch
**if mycoplasma is suspected: the benefit of antibiotic therapy may be slower in the case of mycoplasma and should be re-evaluated after a further 48 hours in the absence of severity criteria; consider the possibility of a viral aetiology in the case of atypical pneumonia.
**hospitalisation if clinical worsening or suspected complication (pleuropneumopathy, foreign body) or consider another diagnosis (e.g. tuberculosis).
