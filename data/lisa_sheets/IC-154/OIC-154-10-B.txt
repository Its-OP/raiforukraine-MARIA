Chest CT is not indicated as a first-line treatment for acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

It can be justified, depending on the presentation, for :

- confirm the diagnosis if a chest X-ray is not sufficient,

- identify a complication (pleural effusion, abscess),

- look for a tumour,

- eliminate a differential diagnosis (EP).


In children, thoracic ultrasound is suggested as a first-line treatment, before a CT scan, if the chest X-ray is inadequate.

A CT scan may be justified in children for :

- assess the extent of parenchymal and pleural involvement respectively,

- look for a differential diagnosis or complication (foreign body),

- guide the placement of a pleural drain.
