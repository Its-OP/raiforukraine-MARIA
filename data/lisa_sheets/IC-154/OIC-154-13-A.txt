|Description=Overview of symptomatic treatment (prioritisation of oxygenation techniques, physiotherapy, etc.) and aetiology: knowing how to prescribe treatment for lower respiratory infections (criteria for choosing molecules (antibiotics, etc.), routes of administration, duration of treatment) according to the patient's condition and radio-clinical presentation; not including dosage. Knowing not to prescribe antibiotics (bronchitis, bronchiolitis).

'''Fundamental principles of antibiotic therapy during acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP):'''

1. antibiotic therapy is probabilistic and urgent ;

2. the choice of molecules depends on the terrain, the radio-clinical and biological presentation, and the severity of the disease;

3. Pneumococcus is the most frequently implicated bacterium: it is systematically taken into account (except for non-severe CAP in young subjects with a presentation suggestive of atypical bacteria);

4. treatment must be re-evaluated after 48-72 hours for :

*extend antibiotic coverage in the absence of improvement,
*adjust the spectrum according to the results of microbiological samples or improvement under antibiotic therapy that does not cover the germ;

5. Treatment usually lasts 7 days (5 days for uncomplicated CAP in children with no previous history).


'''Choice of antibiotic therapy for CAP (in adults):'''

*1- ''PAC managed on an outpatient basis
**Young patient with no co-morbidity:
***Amoxicillin (oral) or related macrolide (pristinamycin) if atypical bacteria suspected.
***if unsuccessful within 48 hours: switch
**subject > 65 years (physiological age) or comorbidity:
***Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (oral route) or ceftriaxone (if oral route not possible) or anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone (FQAP) if allergic to beta-lactams.
***if unsuccessful within 48 hours: hospitalisation

*2- ''PAC hospitalised in the conventional sector
**Pneumococcus suspected or confirmed :
***Amoxicillin (IV)
***If unsuccessful within 48 hours: reassessment (complication?)
**Pneumococcus not suspected :
***''Young subject'' :
****''Amoxicillin'' (IV)
****Failure after 48 hours: reassessment and combination or switch with macrolide
***Elderly or with co-morbidity:''''Amoxicillin
****''Amoxicillin + ac. clavulanique'' (IV) or ceftriaxone or anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone (FQAP) if allergic to beta-lactams
**** ''If unsuccessful within 48 hours: reassessment''

*3- ''CAP hospitalised in intensive care or resuscitation:''
**General case: cefotaxime or ceftriaxone IV + macrolide IV or levofloxacin
**Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak: piperacillin / tazobactam or C4G or carbapenem + amikacin or tobramycin (3-5 days) + IV macrolide or levofloxacin.

'''Special cases''' :

*''documented CAP with'' ''Legionella'' :
**''without sign of severity'': macrolide PO for 8 days
**with signs of severity or immunocompromised: levofloxacin for 21 days

*CAP with abscess": amoxicillin/clavulanic acid IV OR C3G IV + metronidazole (uncodified duration: 3 to 6 weeks)

*Superinfected influenza pneumonia'': Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pristinamycin or FQAP (the antibiotic therapy covers pneumococcus and Staphylococcus aureus oxacillin-S).


Choice of antibiotic therapy for CAP in children

*With no signs of seriousness
**under 3 years = suspect pneumococcus first:
***amoxicillin 80 to 100 mg/kg/day PO, not to exceed 3g/day
***in case of allergy to penicillin: 3rd generation cephalosporin IV (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone)
***in the event of widespread allergy to beta-lactams: hospital paediatric opinion
**After 3 years of age
***if the presentation is suggestive of mycoplasma infection, a "macrolide" may be used as a first-line treatment, but the possibility of a viral aetiology should also be considered before initiating antibiotic therapy.
***in the event of an acute presentation suggestive of pneumococcus: amoxicillin 80 to 100 mg/kg/day PO, but not more than 3g/day
****if allergy: pristinamycin
*In severe cases: beware of pneumococcus, Staphylococcus and group A Streptococcus, especially if there is pleural effusion for Staphylococcus and GAS.

'''Associated treatments:''''

- Respiratory physiotherapy (adults)

- Probabilistic anti-influenza treatment for suspected influenza in hospitalised adult patients (oseltamivir PO - 5 days)


There is no indication for antibiotic therapy except in cases of bronchitis and bronchiolitis, which are most often viral in origin.
