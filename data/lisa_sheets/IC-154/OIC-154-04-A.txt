'''Clinical diagnosis of pneumonia'''

Typical partners are :

*infectious" signs (fever) and "general" signs (asthenia)
*functional respiratory signs: dyspnoea; cough; purulent sputum; possibly chest pain
*physical signs of lung parenchymal involvement, especially focal crackles. In the case of significant condensation, a tubal murmur, dullness and increased vocal vibration may be present.


and, possibly, signs of complications:

*pleurisy", which gives a pleural syndrome: decrease in vesicular murmur; abolition of vocal vibrations; dullness; and possibly pleuritic murmur
*pulmonary abscess": significant deterioration in general condition; abundant sputum ("vomit"); haemoptysis possible.


Depending on the germs involved, the presentation may be different and '''guide the microbiological hypothesis:'''

*Pneumococcus: usually acute frank lobar pneumonia (AFLP).
**onset: sudden with high fever from day 1
**respiratory function signs: marked, including focal thoracic pain; initial dry cough, then purulent or rusty sputum, dyspnoea depending on severity
**auscultatory signs: marked
**extra-thoracic signs: recurrence of herpes labialis possible in children, abdominal pain sometimes very intense, particularly in basal pneumonia.
*Atypical" (intracellular) germs: "Mycoplasma pneumoniae", "Clamydophila pneumoniae" and "psittaci":
**onset: gradual; identifiable contagion
**general signs: mild
**functional respiratory signs: often limited to a dry cough
**auscultatory signs: often absent
**extra-thoracic signs: frequent, including : ENT (nasopharyngitis); polyarthralgia; myalgia; diarrhoea; skin rash.
*Legionellosis:
**onset: rapidly progressive
**general signs: often marked (fever and AEG)
**respiratory function signs: often present, depending on severity
**auscultatory signs: often present
**extra-thoracic signs: very frequent, especially digestive (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, vomiting) and neurological (confusion, hallucinations). Pulse-temperature dissociation is suggestive.
*Viral pneumonia: presentation varies according to the virus responsible:
**Onset: often rapid; sometimes V-shaped course; epidemic context.
**General signs: often marked (fever, asthenia)
**Functional respiratory signs: dry cough; dyspnoea depending on severity.
**Auscultatory signs: may be absent.
**Extra-thoracic signs: frequent: myalgias, headaches, ENT signs, conjunctivitis, digestive signs, skin rash, etc.


A special case of "pneumonia in the elderly": often non febrile, and revealed by the decompensation of a comorbidity or behavioural problems.


Clinical diagnosis of bronchitis

Acute bronchitis is diagnosed clinically:

*Onset: acute; epidemic in nature,
*General signs: inconstant (fever and flu-like syndrome).
*Functional respiratory signs: the cough is initially dry then productive, often painful. Sputum is mucous or purulent.
*Auscultatory signs: absent, or bronchial rales. There is never an outbreak of crackles.

Clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis in infants under 12 months of age

The definition of acute bronchiolitis :

*Onset: acute; epidemic in nature
*General signs: inconstant
*Functional respiratory signs: polypnoea, dyspnoea (signs of struggle which can be very marked, leading to respiratory distress); cough.
*Auscultatory signs: wheezing and/or crackles (associated alveolitis).
*Extra-thoracic signs: rhinitis

/Beware of the differential diagnosis of heart failure in the presence of respiratory distress in infants. In the presence of tachycardia and polypnoea, make sure there is no hepatomegaly.
