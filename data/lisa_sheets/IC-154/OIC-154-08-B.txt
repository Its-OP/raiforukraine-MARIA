In the event of acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), tests to document the infectious agent responsible are indicated according to :

- severity, and therefore the patient's referral,

- whether or not the patient is immunocompromised.


For example

*for acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) without severity criteria, managed on an outpatient basis: no microbiological examination
*
*for CAP requiring hospitalisation in the conventional sector:
**at least :
***Blood cultures
***Sputum cytobacteriological examination in adults (ECBC)
**depending on the context:
***Syndromic PCR (multiplex) on nasopharyngeal swab during epidemics (only useful if this leads to a change in management).
***Legionella antigenuria in adults if suggestive signs or context
***Pneumococcal antigenuria if suggestive signs or context (of no value in children under 5 as it does not distinguish between carriage and infection)
***Atypical bacteria PCR if suggestive sign or context (often included in syndromic PCR / asymptomatic carriage of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is common in children).
***Pleural fluid: if effusion (possibility of testing for pneumococcal Ag in pleural fluid).
*
*for CAP "requiring ICU/resuscitation hospitalisation":
**as a minimum
***blood cultures
***ECBC or bronchial aspiration
***Multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs during epidemic periods
***Legionella antigenuria in adults
***Pneumococcal antigenuria after 5 years of age
**depending on context:
***PCR atypical bacteria if suggestive sign or context
***Pleural fluid: if effusion
*
*In immunocompromised patients:
**as a minimum
***Blood cultures
***ECBC
***Multiplex PCR on nasopharyngeal swab (especially during epidemics)
**depending on the context:
***Legionella antigenuria if suggestive sign or context
***Pneumococcal antigenuria if suggestive sign or context
***PCR atypical bacteria if suggestive sign or context
***Pleural fluid: if effusion
***Pneumocystis" test on induced sputum or bronchial fibroscopy
***ÃŸ-D-glucan antigen
***bronchial fibroscopy for directed deep sampling.
