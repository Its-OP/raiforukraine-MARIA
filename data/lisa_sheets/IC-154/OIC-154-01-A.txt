'''Acute bronchitis:''' acute inflammation of the bronchi and bronchioles, usually infectious in nature, without affecting the lung parenchyma.


''Bronchiolitis in infants'': acute inflammation of the bronchioles of viral origin in infants, occurring in seasonal epidemics.


'''Acute community-acquired pneumonia''': acute infection of the lung parenchyma, of community acquisition (as opposed to nosocomial)


''Nosocomial pneumonia'': pneumonia occurring at least 48 hours after the start of hospitalisation; as opposed to ''community'' pneumonia.


Acute lobar frank pneumonia (ALFP)'': acute infection of the lung parenchyma, characterised by a sudden onset and its systematised nature in one lobe of the lung.


''Atypical pneumonia'': infections of the pulmonary parenchyma caused by so-called ''atypical'', intracellular germs: ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' above all, ''Chlamydophila pneumoniae'' and ''Chlamydophila psittaci'' much more rarely.

'''Complicated pneumonia:''' infections of the lung parenchyma, associated with

- pleurisy

- an abscess

- an endobronchial obstruction


'''Pulmonary abscess''': cavitary necrotic lesion in the lung.
