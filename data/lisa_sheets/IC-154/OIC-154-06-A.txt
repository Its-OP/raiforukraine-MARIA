'''Signs of severity of acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP):'''

The signs of clinical severity determine :

the patient's *'''' orientation;
*the choice of ''complementary examinations;'''
*the choice of initial probabilistic ''antibiotic therapy''.

The CRB65 score is purely clinical, and is used to assess immediate severity and guide patient management.

If only one of the following 4 criteria is present, an inpatient assessment is recommended:

*Confusion ;
*Respiratory rate > 30 ;
*Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or diastolic BP â‰¤ 60 mmHg,
*Age (physiological) > 65 years


Assessing the severity of CAP involves looking for :

*signs of respiratory distress:
**Respiratory rate >30/min
**cyanosis or SpO2 < 90% on O2
**Need for assisted ventilation (respiratory failure or respiratory acidosis)
*Signs of sepsis severity:
**Impaired alertness
**Heart rate > 120 bpm
**Systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg
**septic shock
**Oliguria
**Other organ failure
*Radiological extension and evolution:
**multilobar damage; rapid evolution of lesions
*Biological signs of severity:
**Acute renal or hepatic failure
**Metabolic acidosis; hyperlactataemia
**thrombocytopenia (< 100 G/L)
**Leukopenia (< 4 G/L)
**CVD

If one or more of the signs of seriousness are present, the patient should be considered for admission to an intensive care unit.       

In addition to the signs of seriousness, the patient may need to be hospitalised because of :

- prior failure of outpatient treatment

- decompensation of a comorbidity

- a situation at risk of not taking treatment (including a precarious social situation)


'''Signs of severity of acute pneumonia in children:'''

*field-related":
**age < 6 months;
**cardiac and/or pulmonary comorbidities;
**immunodepression; sickle cell anaemia.
*signs of severity
**AEG , high fever
**Increased respiratory rate for age
**Signs of significant respiratory struggle
**cyanosis
**SpO2 < 95% on room air
**Sweating; disturbed consciousness
**difficulty feeding
**Extent of pneumonia: more than 2 lobes; inter-tracheobronchial adenopathy
**Local complications: pleurisy, abscesses

'''Signs of severity of bronchiolitis (in infants)'''

*''Linked to the terrain and environment:''
**Age < 6 weeks
**Preterm < 34 SA, corrected age < 3 months
**cardiac disease
**Chronic respiratory disease
**Immunodepression
**History of severe bronchiolitis
**Environment not conducive to monitoring or access to care
*
*Clinical signs of severity:''
**AEG , high fever
**Shortness of breath
**cyanosis (hypoxaemia)
**Sweating (hypercapnia)
**malaise
**Respiratory rate > 60 / min
**SpO2 < 94% on room air
**Signs of severe respiratory distress
**Risk of dehydration (digestive signs; food refusal)
**Atelectasis (on chest X-ray)
