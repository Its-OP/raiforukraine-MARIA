* A hernia most often appears as a soft "lump" or protrusion which increases with effort and coughing.

- Initially, the contents of the hernia spontaneously return to the peritoneal cavity at rest. When the hernia becomes larger, the patient may need to help with the reduction.

- At the "umbilical" level, there is a bulge when the patient coughs or pushes. Reduction of the hernia allows the hernia neck to be assessed and measured.

- At the "inguinal" level, the patient consults for an intermittent mass in the groin. When the hernia does not come out spontaneously during coughing or pushing on physical examination in men, the doctor must insert his finger into the inguinal canal through the external orifice and check the solidity of the posterior wall and the hernial engagement in the deep orifice. The examination must always be bilateral and dynamic (at rest and in thrust, in a standing position).

- Inguinal hernia in adults must be distinguished from adenopathy, inguinal endometriosis nodules or spermatic cord pathology.

- Sometimes patients present with inguinal "pain" but have not noticed a mass. In these cases, it is particularly important to examine the inguinal canal correctly and to obtain a detailed history of the characteristics of the pain. It should be distinguished from pain originating in the hip (coxarthrosis, synovitis, osteonecrosis of the femoral head), the testicular cord (epididymitis, funicular cyst) or the pubis (sports pubalgia).

* In the case of "eventrations", they appear as a hernia on or near the existing scar. At rest, when the eventration is reducible, the muscular margins delimiting the defect can be appreciated.

* Evisceration does not pose any diagnostic difficulty as long as there is visceral exposure. The diagnosis may be less obvious when the skin retention sutures are still holding, as the viscera are not exposed, and the tell-tale symptom is a large discharge of sero-sanguinous fluid from the laparotomy.
