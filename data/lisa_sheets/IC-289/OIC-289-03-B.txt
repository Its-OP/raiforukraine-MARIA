* Situations that increase intra-abdominal pressure predispose to the appearance of primary hernias: heavy labour, pregnancy, chronic cough, prostatism, constipation, ascites. They also facilitate the appearance of a ventration. A hernia is said to be a "symptom" when there is an underlying contributing factor.

* Also, in cases of intrinsic fragility (connective tissue diseases such as Ehler-Danlos disease) or acquired fragility (advanced age, muscle wasting) of the abdominal wall, hernias are more frequent.
