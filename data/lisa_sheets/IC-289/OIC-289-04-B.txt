- Inguinal hernia is more common in men and boys due to the migration of the testicle out of the peritoneal cavity during embryological development. This leaves a certain weakness in the inguinal canal.

- In children, inguinal hernia results from the persistence of the peritoneovaginal canal, which facilitates the passage of a segment of intestine or ovary into the inguinal canal.

- There are different anatomical variants of groin hernia (direct, indirect, femoral). Inguinal hernias proper are the consequence of visceral involvement in the inguinal canal with exit at the level of the external inguinal orifice. They may be indirect (involvement in the inguinal canal occurs at the level of the deep inguinal orifice, outside the inferior epigastric pedicle, also known as external obliques) or direct (involvement in the inguinal canal occurs through a defect in its posterior wall, medial to the inferior epigastric pedicle). This anatomical difference has no consequences in terms of risk of complications or management. The contents are usually intestinal.

- When an indirect inguinal hernia progresses in size, the contents reach the scrotum by following the inguinal canal. This is known as an inguinoscrotal hernia.

- The femoral hernia passes below the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral vein.

The risk factors for ''eventration and evisceration'' are those that delay healing: advanced age, obesity, surgical site infection, smoking, diabetes, malnutrition, emergency surgery, personal history of hernia and the method of parietal closure.
