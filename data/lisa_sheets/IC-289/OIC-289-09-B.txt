- The diagnosis of umbilical or inguinal hernia does not require any imaging. Physical examination alone is sufficient.

- In special situations (obesity), imaging may be used when the patient's morphology makes physical examination non-contributory.

- In children the HAS explicitly recommends (2018) avoiding imaging for hernia diagnosis.

- The diagnosis of ventration does not require imaging either, but the surgeon will request it often enough to characterise the ventration.

- Evisceration is confirmed in the patient's bed as soon as the viscera are exposed in the postoperative period.

In the case of a painful hernia, it is urgent to check that it is irreducible. Imaging is a waste of time.
