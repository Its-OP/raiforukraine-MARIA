- A hernia is said to be "engorged" when it is irreducible. There is a disproportion between the contents of the hernia sac and the hernia opening, which prevents the contents from being reintegrated into the abdomen. An engorged hernia is not usually painful, but the danger is that it may develop into strangulation.

- The main complication of a hernia (in any location) is strangulation. This occurs when the contents of the hernia sac begin to suffer due to lack of space or vascular compression at the neck. The visceral oedema induced by the difficult venous return, combined with the inflammation that sets in, further increases the volume in a restricted cavity and makes hernia reduction even more complicated.

- The 3 clinical characteristics of a strangulated hernia are that it is painful, irreducible and non-impulsive when coughed up.

- If left untreated, the initial venous ischaemia progresses to arterial ischaemia and necrosis of the contents of the hernia sac.

When the contents of the sac are a segment of the digestive tract, there is an associated picture of intestinal obstruction. Since complicated hernias are the 2nd<sup>nd</sup> cause of intestinal obstruction (and the most frequent in the absence of a history of abdominal surgery), the hernial orifices must be examined in the presence of any intestinal obstruction syndrome.
