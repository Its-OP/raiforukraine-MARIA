- Repairing abdominal wall hernias is the most common operation carried out by visceral and digestive surgeons. More than 250,000 patients a year in France undergo hernia repair.

- Hernias can occur at any age, in both children and adults. They are particularly common after the age of 60, but can occur throughout life.

- Inguinal hernias are most common in all age and sex groups. It is much more common in males, particularly in the indirect sex. Femoral hernias are more common in women.

- The second most common hernia is the umbilical hernia. It usually contains omentum magnum or preperitoneal fat.

- Primary hernias may occur in all areas of weakness in the abdominal wall, particularly in the supraumbilical linea alba.

Eventration occurs in 20% of laparotomies. Evisceration occurs in less than 5% of cases.
