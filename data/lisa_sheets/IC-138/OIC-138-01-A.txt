'''Title: Definition and ways of feeling and expressing pain''''

'''Description : Understanding the different components of the experience and expression of pain'''

'''Sensory and emotional experience''': subjective and multidimensional.

- 4 components: sensory (or sensory-discriminative), affective (or affective-emotional), cognitive and behavioural.

- 4 mechanisms: ''excess of nociception, neuropathic, dysfunctional or nociplastic'' (by central or peripheral sensitisation, due to a disorder in the pain control and modulation systems), psychogenic (not always used, this mechanism is difficult to confirm according to the WHO).

- The complaint is the individual expression of the pain, depending on its components, mechanisms, learning, personality and context.

- Anxiety, stress, pessimism, catastrophism, depression, avoidance, repetitive negative thoughts, preoccupation with health, lack of confidence in self-efficacy, lack of social support, ''all favour the perception of pain and its learning or conditioning''.

- Acute pain generates worry and even anxiety. Chronic pain generates anxiety in 20-50% of patients, and pessimism and depression in 20%. These "emotional components" need to be assessed and treated.

- Avoidance behaviour initially keeps the pain at bay. But it leaves the person unconditioned. This is "countered by adapted physical activity and physiotherapy". Adapted behaviour needs to be reinforced.

- Negative cognitions'' and unrealistic expectations are countered by a ''realistic and shared therapeutic project'', leading to a ''better adjustment''.
