'''Description : To understand the clinical expression of pain associated with the main personality disorders'''


- In the paranoid personality, pain and its treatment are experienced with mistrust of health professionals.

- In schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders, the diagnosis of pain may be delayed by impaired social relationships and reduced emotional expression. Pain and its treatment may be approached with inadequate affect, cognition or health-related behaviour.

- In antisocial and borderline personality disorders, pain processing can be "disrupted" by difficulty in following rules, impulsivity and instability.

- In histrionic and narcissistic personalities, pain is often presented with "emphasis" and "lability". It is experienced as "catastrophic", and the treatment as a source of "dissatisfaction" shared by patient and carer.

- In the avoidant and dependent personalities, the patient risks "not participating actively" in care, not getting involved.

- In obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, organisational difficulties and repetitive negative thoughts ''prevent adjustment'' to the pain and its consequences.

- In the case of personality modification due to another medical condition, the illness responsible for the pain or the chronic pain itself can disrupt the personality.

- In all these situations, the "suicide risk" must be explored.

- The therapeutic principles are identical to those used for people without personality disorders. However, the treatment will be adapted to the particularities of the personality in order to achieve the best "therapeutic alliance".
