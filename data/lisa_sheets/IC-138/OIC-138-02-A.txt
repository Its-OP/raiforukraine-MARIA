Title: Diagnosing pain in a patient suffering from a psychiatric disorder.

Description: Understanding the clinical expression of pain associated with the main psychiatric disorders.

- Patients suffering from a psychiatric disorder and people with pervasive developmental disorders are "vulnerable persons".

- In these "polymorbid" populations, with high-risk health behaviours and a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, there is "excess morbidity and excess mortality".

- Pain is present in anxiety. Anxiety is found in both acute and chronic pain.

- Anxiety and anxiety disorders as well as depression are factors in pain perception.

- Pain is a frequent feature of depression. Depressive symptoms are found in chronic pain. Depressive disorders are common: 20% of chronic pain sufferers.

- In cases of depression, the "suicide risk" must be assessed.

- In "psychotic disorders" and "pervasive developmental disorders", the expression of pain may be absent, modified or reinterpreted, delaying recognition of the pain and its treatment.

- The majority of "drug-addicted" patients, including those on substitutes, suffer from pain.

- The ''addictive risk'' of prescribing opioids is increased in cases of inappropriate pain mechanism, dependence or history, anxiety or depression, and may require the use of a screening scale, such as the Opioid Risk Tool.

- In the course of prescribing opioids, incipient addiction should be identified using the POMI (Prescription Opioid Misuse Index) questionnaire, for example.
