'''Title: Screening for pain in dyscommunicative people.'''

'''Descriptif : Know the name of a tool for the hetero-assessment of pain in a dys-communicative person'''

- '''Any change in behaviour should prompt a search for pain and its cause.'''

- If self-assessment is feasible, EN and EVS are preferred.

- The hetero-evaluation tools are: ALGOPLUS, DOLOPLUS, ECPA (behavioural evaluation of pain in the non-communicative elderly), DESS (pain in San Salvadour children), EDAAP, EDD, ESDDA, GED-DI (see above).

- Assessment, and then re-assessment after treatment, relies on "teams and relatives".

- A clinical examination is necessary.

- If the therapeutic principles are identical, practice will take into account the patient's possible adherence to treatment.

- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.
