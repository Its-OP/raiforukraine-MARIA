Activation of sensory neuroreceptors located in the upper and lower airways (nociceptors: chemical irritants; mechanoreceptors: mechanical stimuli).

Information transmitted by afferent pathways to the brainstem (nucleus solitarius) which coordinates the efferent response (inspiration, pressurisation with the glottis closed, then expulsion).
