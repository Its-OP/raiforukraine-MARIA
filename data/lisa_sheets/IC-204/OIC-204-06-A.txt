'''Secondary cough:'''

Common causes:

- Upper airway cough syndrome (rhino-sinus involvement)

- Asthma

- Acid or non-acid gastro-oesophageal reflux disease

- Medications (conversion enzyme inhibitors, gliptin)

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis

Less frequent causes:

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis and other diffuse infiltrative lung diseases

- Bronchial cancer

- Bronchial dilatation

- Sleep apnoea syndrome

- Cardiac causes (left heart failure)

- Neurological causes, swallowing disorders

- Psychogenic cough

'''Refractory or unexplained chronic cough'''

Diagnosis given in the case of a chronic cough for which an aetiological investigation has been negative or no treatment has improved the potential causes of the cough. This is known as refractory or unexplained chronic cough.

Chronic cough due to over-sensitivity is a cause of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. It is linked to excess sensitivity of the cough receptors in the airways. The clinical features that support this diagnosis are :

- Irritation of the upper airways (larynx, pharynx), paresthesia of the upper airways

- Cough triggered by non-tussive stimuli (allotussis): speech, laughter

- Increased sensitivity of cough to inhaled stimuli (hypertussia)

- Paroxysmal cough that is difficult to control
