A nephrological aetiology is sought if the urological work-up is negative and/or if there is a suggestive nephrological syndrome
(highly suggestive associated proteinuria, hypertension, renal failure), or a personal or family history suggestive of haematuric nephropathy.


A. Glomerular nephropathy 261 (to be considered if the haematuria is associated with: glomerular proteinuria, +/- hypertension and
Â± renal failure) confirmed by renal biopsy:
Acquired recurrent macroscopic haematuria syndrome: suggestive of primary IgA nephropathy (mostly in young men: macroscopic haematuria 48 hours after an episode of ENT infection) or congenital: Alport syndrome (family background, deafness, ophthalmological involvement).
- in children, persistent microscopic haematuria should prompt a search for a glomerular cause:
- Alport syndrome: microscopic or macroscopic haematuria;
- acute nephritic syndrome: acute post-infectious glomerulonephritis.

Acute nephritic syndrome: most often post-infectious GN (10-15 days after streptococcal ENT infection),
hypocomplementemia
Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): rapid deterioration in renal function with glomerular syndrome (proteinuria + haematuria)
+/- extra-renal signs revealing systemic disease / vasculitis


B. Acute interstitial nephropathy 262: most often immuno-allergic (often drug-induced), it may combine
haematuria with leucocyturia and renal failure +/- signs of the allergic series (skin rash, cytolysis, etc.).
cytolysis, etc.).
 

C. Nephrological causes with urological clinical presentation (haematuria due to invasion of the urinary tree, responsible for
lumbar pain) :
Papillary necrosis: migration of papillary fragments into the ureter, mimicking nephritic colic, on a favourable
(diabetes, sickle cell anaemia, use of NSAIDs, etc.).
Renal infarction: haematuria with sudden lumbar pain, requiring emergency treatment if it involves the
the main trunk of the renal artery. Thromboembolic or vascular disease, sickle cell disease or post
trauma.
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 266: development of renal cysts in which the vessels in the wall may rupture.
vessels may rupture in the excretory tract, causing haematuria. Haematuria can also reveal
stones or cyst infection. Progression to chronic renal failure
