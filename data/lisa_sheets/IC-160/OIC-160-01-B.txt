The players :

* Clostridium tetani, an environmental bacterium
* Tetanospasmin, a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani, internalised in neurons where it prevents the release of neurotransmitters.
* Spinal inhibitory interneurons, neurons in the spinal cord that regulate neuronal excitation.


The sequence of events (see figure) :

* Exposure to the Clostridium tetani toxin, tetanospasmin (1)
* Passage into the bloodstream (2)
* Retrograde transport via peripheral motor neurons
* Release at the 1<sup>er</sup> synaptic relay in the spinal cord.
* Internalisation into inhibitory interneurons
* Blockage of membrane proteins required for exocytosis (3)
* Loss of the inhibitory action of these interneurons
** Increase in muscle tone
** Painful spasms
** Dysautonomia
