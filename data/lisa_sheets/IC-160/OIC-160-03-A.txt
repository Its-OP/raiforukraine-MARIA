Tetanus cannot be eradicated worldwide because it is a ubiquitous soil bacterium.

Excellent effectiveness of preventive measures:

*Rapid disinfection of potentially tetanogenic wounds (wounds SD-170, bites and stings SD-169).
*Vaccination already scheduled in the vaccination calendar at M2, M4, M11, 6 years, 11 years, 25-45-65 years and then every 10 years (see [[Vaccinations for adults and children SD-322|'''vaccination calendar''']]).
*If no vaccination up to date, see table below.

It is important to note the importance of pre-existing wounds, particularly ulcers of vascular origin ([[Cutaneous ulcer SD-092|'''Cutaneous ulcer''']]), which are a not uncommon route of entry for tetanus.
