Tetanus should be suspected in the presence of any ''trismus'', whether or not a tetanogenic wound has been identified.

Tetanus then most often progresses to a form of generalised contraction, with signs of dysautonomia and no fever.


The main differential diagnoses to consider are ([[Localized or generalized muscle contracture SD-029|'''Localized or generalized muscle contracture''')]] :

*In the case of isolated trismus: look for local-regional pathologies of the temporomandibular joint (arthritis) or of dental origin (abscess).
*Other causes of localised or generalised hypertonia: consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome, phenothiazine dystonia (1st generation neuroleptic), exposure to strychnine (rat poison) and the exceptional stiff man syndrome (often paraneoplastic).
