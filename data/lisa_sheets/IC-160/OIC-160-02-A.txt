C. tetani is naturally present in our environment (around 30% of soils contain it).

*Contamination via a wound (gardening, object soiled with soil), possibly pre-existing (ulcer of the lower limbs, etc.).
*multiplication of the bacteria at the site of inoculation, production of the toxin

The risk groups are :

* people who have not been vaccinated against tetanus, or who have been poorly vaccinated
* in Western countries: mainly elderly people, predominantly women (no military service, less frequent occupational health check-ups)
* In developing countries, it is maternal and neonatal tetanus that is most common (80% of forms of tetanus): poor hygiene conditions during childbirth / care of the cord
