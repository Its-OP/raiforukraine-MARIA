The term dyskinesias is most often used to describe choreic and/or dystonic movements. The term dyskinesia is usually reserved :

- or to abnormal involuntary movements induced by L-dopa in Parkinson's disease: peak-dose (or mid-dose) dyskinesias or biphasic dyskinesias (beginning or end of dose);

- or dyskinesias induced by antipsychotics, including acute dyskinesias (cervical dystonia, oculogyric seizures, trismus, more common in young subjects), late dyskinesias during prolonged treatment (oral-facial-masticatory dyskinesias causing problems with phonation, swallowing and poor dental condition) which are difficult to treat, and akathisia (incessant trampling).
