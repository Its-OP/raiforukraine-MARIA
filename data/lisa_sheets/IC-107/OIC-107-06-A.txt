Tics may be benign and isolated, occurring most often in childhood and not compromising socio-professional adaptation, or they may correspond to Tourette's disease defined by a combination of simple and complex motor and vocal tics present every day, having an impact on the patient's functioning and socio-professional adaptation, and sometimes associated with co-morbidities (obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, self-mutilation or autism).

The positive diagnosis of tic is based on clinical findings, as is the diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome.
