===1.  Resting tremor (or parkinsonian tremor) ===
Resting tremor (or Parkinsonian tremor) is present at rest and disappears during muscle contraction and sleep, is slow (4-6 Hz), affects the limbs distally, the lips or chin, never the head or voice, is unilateral or asymmetric and is aggravated by emotions and mental calculation. It is highly suggestive of Parkinson's disease, secondary to damage to the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigrostriatal pathway]] but is not mandatory for diagnosis.

Tremor SD-128|trembling]] can be linked to other causes of parkinsonian syndrome, in particular Wilson's disease or iatrogenic parkinsonian syndrome (see below).

If the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is strongly suspected and the patient is aged over 40, no further tests are necessary.

Conversely, brain MRI and a copper panel including cupraemia, ceruloplasminaemia and 24-hour cupruria are necessary before the age of 40 to rule out Wilson's disease.

===2.  Action tremor===
- Present when maintaining a posture ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] postural) and/or arriving at the target ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] intentional).

The most common cause of postural [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]] is essential [[SD-128 tremor|tremor]].

This is an action tremor, both postural and intentional, bilateral and symmetrical, mainly affecting the upper limbs and the head, which progresses slowly over several years and sometimes decades. It is seen when the patient writes, reproduces a spiral, maintains a posture such as stretching their hands out in front of them (the outstretched arm manoeuvre, also known as the oath manoeuvre) or bringing their index fingers together horizontally (the swordsman manoeuvre), performs an action such as pouring water from one glass to another (the glass test) or holds a note aloud (voice tremor). It can be a handicap when performing everyday activities (such as eating) and can cause psychosocial embarrassment.

===3.  Cerebellar tremor===
- This is an action [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that appears or is maximal upon arrival at the target (intention tremor).

- Its frequency is around 3 Hz. It is triggered by an intentional action (drinking a glass of water, finger-nose test).

- Other cerebellar symptoms may be identified: dysarthria (and not a genuine speech and/or phonation disorder) on finger-nose and heel-knee manoeuvres, dyschronometric asynergy, hypotonia, cerebellar ataxia with dancing of the tendons on standing without worsening when the eyes are occluded (negative Romberg manoeuvre) and walking and balance disorders. Cerebellar gait is often identified during the assessment of the onset of walking difficulties and is characterised by a disturbance of balance with a widening of the sustentation polygon, lurching, instability and incoordination of movements.

- Similarly, in the event of an acute cerebellar syndrome, vitamin B1 should be measured/supplemented in order to search for/treat Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy, which may be responsible for mental confusion/disorientation.

- Acute drunkenness is a frequent cause of acute cerebellar syndrome and warrants prevention of alcohol-related risks.

- The acute onset of a cerebellar syndrome warrants a [[request for a cerebral imaging test]] in search of a cerebellar ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, which may be the cause of compression of the fourth ventricle responsible for hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension, which may also be the cause of [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]. 

===4.  Exaggeration of [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] physiological:===
Exaggeration of the [[Trembling SD-128|trembling]] physiological: in this case there is systematically the [[suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care]] (see below). Particular circumstances (hyperthyroidism: analysis of thyroid balance with TSH measurement; excessive consumption of caffeine) may cause an exaggeration of the physiological tremor (which is a normal phenomenon, of muscular origin, not linked to an attack on the central nervous system), which may then be confused with a tremor of another nature.

===5.  [[Tremor SD-128|Trumbling]] functional (or psychogenic)===
This is a [[Tremor SD-128|tremor]] that does not correspond to any neurological pathology described above. It is usually characterised by a sudden onset (often in an emotional context or in a patient with psychological fragility), distractibility (during a competing task, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] disappears or changes), frequency entrainment (during a motor task performed by the contralateral limb at a given frequency, the [[Tremors SD-128|trembling]] tends to adopt the same frequency). It may be present both at rest and in action (which is unusual), may disappear spontaneously, and may be polymorphous and atypical (neurological abnormalities that cannot be systematised, etc.). It tends to occur in people with a history of somatisation.
