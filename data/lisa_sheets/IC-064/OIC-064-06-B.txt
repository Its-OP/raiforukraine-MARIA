''Prognosis'' ''and evolution'' :

Recurring chronic conditions.

Symptomatic and functional remission possible with appropriate treatment. As episodes progress, they become more severe, longer and more difficult to treat; remission becomes more difficult to achieve. Sometimes, residual symptoms persist between episodes, particularly depression or cognitive disorders, with repercussions on socio-professional functioning: disability, precariousness, social isolation, consequences on maintaining a job.

25 to 40% of patients experience rapid cycles (at least 4 episodes per year) at some point during the course of their disorder.

The risk of medico-legal acts is multiplied by 2 to 3.

Psychiatric and non-psychiatric morbidity and mortality:

- psychiatric comorbidities: addictions, anxiety disorders, severe personality disorders, sleep disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, [[Suicidal ideation or behaviour/self-harm SD-125|suicide]] (6-15%) and suicidal behaviour

- non-psychiatric comorbidities: cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, OSA, hypothyroidism

- 10 to 20 years of life lost due to premature death, mainly from cardiovascular disease and suicide
