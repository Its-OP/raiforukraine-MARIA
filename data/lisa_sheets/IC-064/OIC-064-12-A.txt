*Rehydration, nutrition, correction of fluid and electrolyte disorders.
*Treatment of sleep disturbances: prescribe an anxiolytic/hypnotic.
*Prevention of risky behaviour
*Discontinuation of antidepressant treatment where appropriate
*Background drug treatment: thymoregulator (lithium salts, sodium divalproate, carbamazepine) and/or second-generation antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, aripiprazole).
*Clinical and paraclinical monitoring of treatment efficacy and tolerance.
*Legal protection measures: safeguard of justice.

===Characteristic depressive episode===

*Treatment of agitation
*Prevention of suicidal risk
*Rehydration, nutrition, correction of hydro-electrolytic disorders
*Treatment of sleep disturbances: prescribe an anxiolytic/hypnotic.
*Background drug treatment: thymoregulator (lithium salts or lamotrigine) or second-generation antipsychotic (quetiapine LP).
*Clinical and paraclinical monitoring of treatment efficacy and tolerance.

===Role of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)===
ECT can also be used in the acute, manic or depressive phase, when symptoms are severe and life-threatening in the short term, or in cases of drug resistance (ineffectiveness or unacceptable side-effects).
