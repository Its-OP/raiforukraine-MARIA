''Bipolar depressive episode'': A depressive episode may occur in isolation or in the context of recurrent depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. It combines a loss of vital drive (overall reduction in drive, motor activity and intellectual processes: [[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]] and psychomotor slowing) and a depressed mood (pessimistic view of the world and oneself). The term "characterised" means that it meets all the diagnostic criteria for a depressive episode and "bipolar" means that it occurs during the course of a bipolar disorder.
