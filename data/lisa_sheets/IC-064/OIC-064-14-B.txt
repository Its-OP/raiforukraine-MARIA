==Long-term pharmacological management==

===The treatment consists of 3 phases:===

*Acute episode (6-8 weeks): thymoregulation and/or second-generation antipsychotic treatment with the aim of achieving symptomatic remission.
*Consolidation (4-6 months): continuation of the treatment used during the acute episode, with gradual withdrawal of treatments associated with the thymoregulator, with the aim of preventing a relapse of the episode and achieving functional remission.
*Prevention (at least 2 years if a single episode, at least 5 years if several episodes): continuation of thymoregulation treatment in order to prevent a recurrence, i.e. a new episode.


It will be important to monitor efficacy, tolerance and compliance for each phase: follow-up consultation and background treatment of a patient suffering from a [[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SD-279|chronic psychiatric disorder]]
