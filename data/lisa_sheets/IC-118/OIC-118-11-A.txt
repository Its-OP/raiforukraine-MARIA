Unilateral spatial neglect (NSU) ([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SDD-131|134-memory disorders/cognitive decline]], [[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SDD-298|298-consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]]) = inability to take into account stimuli coming from the hemispace opposite the brain lesion.

It is secondary to brain damage and is common after a stroke, mainly affecting the right hemisphere.


This negligence can affect :

- The body or personal neglect: forgetting to care for the face (shaving, hairdressing), under-use of the upper limb, etc.

- Space or extra-personal negligence :

o Nearby space: bumping into something, not finding a nearby object in the neglected hemifield, etc.

o Distant space: difficulty with spatial orientation.
