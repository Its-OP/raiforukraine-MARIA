'''A.  Assessment of motor impairments''' ([[Joint pain SDD-067|67-joint pain]], [[Muscle weakness SDD-074|74-muscle weakness]], [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SDD-121|121-sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]], [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SDD-260|260-assessment and management of chronic pain]], [[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SDD-276|279-management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]])

- Joint impairments: joint limitation (goniometer).

- Motor deficiencies: measurement of strength (manual muscle testing), assessment of muscle tone (Ashworth scale), assessment of motor coordination, assessment of dexterity (Box and Block test), etc.

- Sensory impairments: pain assessment (numerical or visual analogue scale, DN4 questionnaire, behavioural scales).


Specific scales exist depending on the pathology, such as the ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) score for spinal cord injuries or Lequesne's modified algo-functional index for osteoarthritis.


'''B.  Assessment of activity limitations and participation restrictions'' ([[Disability situation SDD-345|345-Disability situation]], [[Progressive loss of autonomy SDD-031|31-progressive loss of autonomy]], [[Appearance of difficulty walking SDD-066|66-appearance of difficulty walking]], [Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging SDD-226|226-discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging]], [[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SDD-276|279-management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]])

- Definitions :

o Activity limitation = difficulty performing a task of daily living

o Restriction of participation = restriction in a social activity or in a real-life situation

- Ratings :

o Interview and clinical examination,

o Generic or specific scales,

o Instrumental analysis.

- Examples of scales: Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL, geriatric scale, particularly if cognitive impairment), AGGIR grid.
