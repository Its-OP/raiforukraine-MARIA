There are 3 types of deafness [[(Know the main types of deafness)]] :

- Transmission = pathology of the outer and middle ear.

- Perceptive = pathology of the inner ear, the auditory nerve or the central auditory pathways.

- Mixed = combination of sensorineural and conductive hearing loss.

Classification of hearing loss :

- Mild: 20 to 39 dB hearing loss. Discomfort when the speaker speaks in a low voice or walks away.

- Average: 40 to 69 dB hearing loss. Speech perceived if the voice is raised.

- Severe: 70 to 89 dB hearing loss. Loud speech perceived close to the ear.

- Profound: > 90 dB hearing loss. No speech perception.

- Total (cophosis): average loss of 120db. No sound perceived.


'''Know how to describe the warning signs of deafness in children and adults ([[Paediatric follow-up consultation SDD-296|Paediatric follow-up consultation SDD-296,]]  [[Systematic neonatal screening SDD-308]])''''

*In infants: neonatal screening ([[To know the modalities of systematic screening for hearing disorders OIC-047-10-A|To know the modalities of systematic screening for hearing disorders]]), anomaly in the developmental calendar.

*In pre-school children: delayed acquisition of language or delayed speech.

*In school-age children: school delay, articulation problems, etc.

*In adults: reduced audibility (can't hear) and/or reduced intelligibility (can't understand), particularly in noise.


'''Know the principles of audiometric testing'''

1.      <u>Acoumetric triad</u> [[(Know the criteria for acoumetric tests)]] :

Weber test: the tuning fork is placed on the vertex.

*Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss: Sound perceived louder in the healthy ear.

*Unilateral conductive hearing loss: Sound perceived louder in the deaf ear.

Rinne test: the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid and then in front of the external auditory canal:

*Sound better perceived in air conduction than in bone conduction = positive Rinne = normal or sensorineural hearing loss.

*Sound better heard through bone conduction than through air conduction = negative Rinne = conductive hearing loss.

2.      <u>Tonal audiometry</u>: sound stimulation with pure tones of varying frequency (Hz) and intensity (dB) [[(Know the definition of a tonal hearing test)]].

3.      <u>Vocal audiometry</u>: sound stimulation with complex meaningful sounds (monosyllabic or bisyllabic words, phrases) or non-meaningful sounds (logatomes) [[(Know the principles of performing tonal, vocal audiometry)]].

4.      <u>Impedancemetry</u>: measurement of middle ear impedance [[(Know the principles of impedancemetry)]].

5.      <u>Screening and assessment in children</u> [[(Know the procedures for systematic screening for hearing disorders)]] :

#Automated early auditory evoked potentials (performed in neonatology or maternity wards),
#Behavioural audiometry (before the age of 10 months), conditioned reflex audiometry (between 10 months and 5 years), classical audiometry (from 5 years),
#Objective testing of early auditory evoked potentials and acoustic otoemissions possible at any age,
#Impedancemetry.


'''Be able to describe the principles of management of a hearing problem in children and adults'''

- Treatment depends on the type of hearing loss and the aetiology.

- Most conductive hearing losses can be treated surgically (ossicular surgery, implanted bone-anchored prosthesis, treatment of a sensorineural hearing loss).

- Sensorineural hearing loss is usually treated with hearing aids (from 30 dB average hearing loss, speech therapy, cochlear implants in severe cases).

- MDPH file

- Prevention of hearing disorders (ototoxicity, noise trauma, cardiovascular risk factors)
