Organisations involved in maintaining or integrating disabled people into employment:

- Orientation of the disabled person to ensure professional integration,

- The granting of RQTH status (Recognition of Disabled Worker Status),

- The award of the disabled adult allowance (AAH) (depending on the degree of disability and the reduction in work capacity).

- Help to maintain employment if it is impossible to adapt the workstation or to find a job,

- A competitive examination or specific contractual recruitment to access a job in the civil service,

- Training assistance.

RQTH beneficiaries are not obliged to inform their employers.

- Receives contributions from companies with more than 20 employees that do not reserve 6% of their workforce for disabled workers (proportional contribution).

- Finances professional integration (in private companies, FIPHFP in the civil service), in particular by contributing financially to the necessary adaptation of workstations.

- Leading a network of partners to promote the integration and retention of disabled people in employment


3) The occupational health service

For disabled employees, it is the responsibility of the occupational physician :

- Prescribe workstation adjustments if necessary

- Informing and advising workers on the relays and players likely to support them in their career path in the event of dismissal for unfitness (application for RQTH, etc.)
