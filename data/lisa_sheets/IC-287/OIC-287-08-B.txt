1/ The role of imaging in the diagnosis of diverticulitis and its complications

An imaging examination should be discussed for each episode. Abdomino-pelvic CT with injection (in the absence of contraindication to injection, allergy to iodinated contrast products, renal insufficiency) is the reference examination. Lower gastrointestinal opacification during the CT scan is not routinely recommended. A CT scan is used to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis, to look for complications and, if necessary, to establish a differential diagnosis. Other imaging tests are not recommended.

Please note that early colonoscopy''''', i.e. during the acute phase of acute sigmoid diverticulitis, is '''''contre-indicated'''''.

'''2/ The role of imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of diverticular haemorrhage'''

To confirm the diverticular origin, other causes of digestive haemorrhage must first be ruled out by digestive endoscopy.

- Ano-perineal examination to avoid ignoring an ''obvious'' ano-perineal cause (proctological examination +)''.

- In the event of haemodynamic repercussions, an oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy should be considered in order not to miss an upper digestive haemorrhage of low expression.

- In the absence of "severe" haemodynamic repercussions, a total colonoscopy within 72 hours with a possible endoscopic haemostasis procedure is indicated.

Cross-sectional imaging (abdominal-pelvic CT scan with injection of contrast medium) is rarely indicated, and is mainly performed in cases of haemodynamic repercussions without an upper digestive tract cause.
