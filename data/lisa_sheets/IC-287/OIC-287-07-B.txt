Certain drugs are associated with diverticulitis and its complications: NSAIDs, corticoids, immunosuppressants. In addition, they can mask clinical symptoms in the early stages of the disease. NSAIDs should not be prescribed if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of diverticulitis.

Others, such as NSAIDs, platelet aggregation inhibitors and anticoagulants, encourage diverticular haemorrhage, independently of diverticulitis flare-ups.
