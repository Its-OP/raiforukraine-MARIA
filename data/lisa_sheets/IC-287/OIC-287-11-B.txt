1/ diverticulitis

Treatment of a complicated form of diverticulitis is primarily medical and is based on the following elements:

- Hospitalization

- Intravenous antibiotic therapy active against aerobic (Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci) and anaerobic colonic bacteria for 7 to 15 days, depending on the condition and progress:

o amoxicillin-clavulanic acid + gentamicin

o or 3rd<sup>th</sup> generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) + metronidazole

o if allergic to beta-lactams: levofloxacin + gentamicin + metronidazole.  

- Radiological drainage of diverticular abscesses if technically feasible

- Emergency surgery in case of peritonitis or failure of medical treatment


2/ Diverticular haemorrhage :

Depending on the existence of haemodynamic repercussions and local resources, imaging and upper and lower digestive endoscopy form part of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach at the same time as :

- Supportive care (hospitalisation in an appropriate unit - ICU, filling, transfusion, vasopressive drugs, etc.),

To confirm the diverticular origin, other causes of digestive haemorrhage must first be ruled out.

- The ano-perineal examination to avoid ignoring an obvious ano-perineal cause ''(proctological examination)'''

- If there are haemodynamic repercussions, an oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy (OGD) should be considered, so as not to miss an upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage of low expression. In the case of a normal EOGD in a patient who continues to deglobulate, this situation is the best indication for a CT scan with injection in the case of a digestive haemorrhage: the bleeding is sufficiently abundant to hope to identify its origin on the CT scan. A colonoscopy will be performed rapidly after colonic preparation (using a nasogastric tube if necessary) for diagnostic or haemostatic purposes.

- In the absence of haemodynamic repercussions, a total colonoscopy is indicated afterwards.
