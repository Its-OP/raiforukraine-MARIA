Indications for surgery in complicated diverticulitis, in the emergency phase and afterwards

Emergency surgical treatment should be performed in cases of diverticular peritonitis or complicated diverticulitis with an unfavourable course (failure of medical treatment).

Emergency surgery is still the Hartmann procedure (left colectomy or sigmoidectomy with terminal upstream colostomy and suture of the lower segment) but only in cases of :

o haemodynamic instability

o severe co-morbidity (end-stage renal failure, patient with an ASA score > 3, congenital or acquired immunodepression (immuno-suppressive treatments....)

Apart from these situations, elective sigmoidal resection with colorectal anastomosis protected by an ileostomy may be proposed.

'''''Elective ("cold") surgical treatment should be discussed in cases of:'''''

- persistent symptoms after a relapse or frequent recurrences impacting on quality of life

- after complicated acute diverticulitis, particularly in the case of abscesses

- fistula

- symptomatic stenosis

- in patients with immunodeficiency or chronic renal failure, taking into account the following operative risk factors: age over 75 and co-morbidities, in particular heart disease and COPD.

''The number of relapses is not in itself an indication for surgery, nor is an age below 50''.

''If elective sigmoidectomy is recommended, it should be performed at least 2 months after the last attack''.


'''''After medical treatment of diverticulitis'''''

- Explorations

- Systematic biological monitoring is "not" recommended in the case of a favourable clinical course of acute diverticulitis.

- In the absence of a warning sign, whatever the initial stage, a systematic abdomino-pelvic CT scan following a case of treated sigmoid diverticulitis is "not" recommended.

- It is "not" recommended to carry out a systematic colonoscopy following an attack of acute, uncomplicated diverticulitis, except in cases where colonoscopy is used to screen for or prevent colorectal cancer.

- It is recommended that colonoscopy be performed following an episode of complicated acute diverticulitis.

- These recommendations remain valid when cold surgery is indicated.

- Preventing recurrence of diverticulitis

No diet, probiotic or medical treatment can be recommended to prevent recurrence of diverticulitis.

'''Surgical indications in diverticular haemorrhage'''

They are limited to rare cases where endoscopic and radiological treatments have failed, and are based on colectomy.

- segmental if the haemorrhagic site is identified ;

- subtotal otherwise.
