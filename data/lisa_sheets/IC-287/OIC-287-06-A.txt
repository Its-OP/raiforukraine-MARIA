The essential sign of diverticular peritonitis is abdominal contracture. This is most often a ''2-stage'' peritonitis:

- The 1st stage is the abscess (localised pain and defence, with fever);

- The 2nd stage is that of generalised peritonitis: the contracture involves all the abdominal diaphragms, and the rectum is painful to touch. The contracture is often associated with sepsis, sometimes severe, with signs of shock because it is a stercoral peritonitis (high bacterial load) and an occlusive syndrome linked to reflex ileus. The prognosis is rapidly life-threatening.


The signs of seriousness of diverticular haemorrhage are those common to digestive haemorrhage in general (see digestive haemorrhage item):

- tachycardia with initially preserved arterial pressure,

- then signs of haemodynamic shock: hypotension, mottling, lipothymia, oliguria, polypnoea, sweating, agitation, obnubilation then coma.
