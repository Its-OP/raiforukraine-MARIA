No treatment, and in particular no diet, is indicated for "uncomplicated diverticulosis".


'''Uncomplicated diverticulitis, patient with no co-morbidity and no unfavourable social context:'''

Outpatient symptomatic treatment in the absence of an unfavourable social context.

Symptomatic treatment without antibiotics for uncomplicated diverticulitis confirmed by CT scan is recommended in the absence of :

- signs of seriousness, in particular systolic blood pressure ≤ 100 mm Hg, respiratory rate ≥ 22/min or confusion;

- immunosuppression (congenital or acquired immunosuppression, immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory treatment, systemic corticosteroid therapy, progressive cancer, end-stage renal failure);

- ASA score > 3 (life-threatening, debilitating condition or dying patient)

- pregnancy.


If there is no response to this treatment, oral antibiotic therapy of no more than 7 days is recommended, using amoxicillin and clavulanic acid or, if there is a proven allergy to beta-lactams, a fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin) - metronidazole combination.


In the event of signs of seriousness, pregnancy, ASA score > 3 or immunosuppression, intravenous antibiotic therapy, identical to that given for complicated diverticulitis, is recommended.


A non-restrictive diet is recommended during the treatment of non-perforated diverticulitis if it is tolerated.
