'''<u>MANAGEMENT</u>'''

- If patient conscious

*Swallowing sugar (15 g = 3 lumps), soda or sweets

- If patient unconscious

*No oral ingestion: risk of false route+++.
*everyone can do it: IM or SC injection of glucagon (wakes up in 15 minutes, side effects: nausea, vomiting) or nasal glucagon (not reimbursed) EXCEPT IF ON HYPOGLYCEMIC SULFAMIDE: glucagon contraindicated!
*in hospital: glucagon or direct (slow) intravenous injection of one or two ampoules of 30% glucose solution (immediate awakening), followed by G10%.

'''<u>PREVENTION</u>'''

Prevention is based on patient education:

* know the clinical signs of hypoglycaemia
* be familiar with the drugs that cause hypoglycaemia: sulphonamides, glinides and insulin
* be aware of high-risk situations (a light meal without reducing insulin doses, too long a delay between the injection of rapid-acting insulin and the meal, heavy physical exertion without reducing insulin doses or having a snack, an error in insulin dose or sulphonamide/glinide intake, resolving a hyperglycaemic situation such as an infection, stress or corticosteroid therapy).

Preventing hypoglycaemia requires appropriate treatment with insulin or sulphonamide/glinide, depending on the situation and the course of the diabetes.
