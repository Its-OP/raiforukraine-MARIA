Type 1 diabetes is characterised by a lack of insulin secretion by the pancreas as a result of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells.

Several factors are involved in the pathophysiology:

- genetic predisposition

- environmental factors

- autoimmune processes

The following autoantibodies are used as markers of autoimmune disease:

- anti-islanding (ICA),

- anti-insulin (in children)

- anti-GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase)

- anti-IA2 (Islet Antigen Number 2, related to a tyrosine phosphatase)

- anti-ZnT8 (Î²-cell zinc transporter).


Other autoimmune diseases and/or organ-specific antibodies may be associated with type 1 diabetes: thyroidopathies, slow adrenal insufficiency, gastric atrophy, coeliac disease and vitiligo.
