1/ Ketoacidosis

Ketoacidosis is the most frequent cause of death in children with type 1 diabetes.  It is often indicative of the disease.

'''Clinical presentation''' :

- cardinal syndrome associated with signs of dehydration, digestive, respiratory and neurological signs

'''Biological confirmation:'''

'''- '''See chapter on "Recognising hypoglycaemia, hyperosmolar coma and diabetic ketoacidosis".

'''Other essential tests:'''

- Blood ionogram: calculate corrected natraemia; assess kalaemia

- CBC, CRP: sometimes hyperleukocytosis without infection

- ECG: look for signs of dyskalaemia


'''Immediate care:'''

- emergency hospitalisation with cardiorespiratory monitoring

- 2 peripheral venous lines and fasting

- fluid and electrolyte rehydration and vascular filling (if collapse)

- rapid-acting IV insulin

- treatment of the triggering factor


'''Surveillance:'''

- vitals, diuresis, blood glucose and ketone levels, venous GDS, blood ionogram, renal function, ECG.

- monitoring of the neurological examination in view of the risk of cerebral oedema


2/ Hypoglycaemia

''Minor hypoglycaemia'': recognised and correctable by ingestion of carbohydrates by the child

Severe hypoglycaemia: signs of neuroglycopenia and need for intervention by a third party.


'''Risk factors:''' errors in diabetes management, history of severe hypoglycaemia and failure to recognise signs of hypoglycaemia


'''Triggering factor:''' insulin dose error, dietary error, prolonged physical effort.


'''Diagnosis:''' see chapter on ''Recognising hypoglycaemia, hyperosmolar coma and diabetic ketoacidosis''.


'''Taking charge:'''

'''No disturbance of consciousness:'''

- oral resugaring = 1 sugar cube (5 g) or 1/2 glass of fruit juice/soda per 20 kg of weight; then slow sugar (1-2 pieces of bread)

'''If consciousness is impaired:''''

- injection of glucagon IM or SC , then per os resugaring

- if glucagon unavailable: serum G30% IV 10 mL/20 kg weight, then relay with G10%.


'''Necessary therapeutic education:''' self-monitoring of blood sugar levels, prevention of hypoglycaemia
