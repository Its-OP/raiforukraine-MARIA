Diabetic patients benefit from multidisciplinary monitoring (general practitioner, specialist, dietician, chiropodist, etc.), the objectives of which include prevention, screening, treatment of complications and achieving optimal control of CV risk factors. [Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320]]


Specialist doctors (cardiologist, nephrologist, neurologist) are called in to help with diagnosis (additional assessment), treatment and monitoring of complications.


Qualified geriatric staff are called in to carry out standardised assessments if frailty is identified.

Diabetologists are usually called in when diabetes is discovered, particularly in atypical forms, when there is severe imbalance (HbA1c>10%), particularly when intensive insulin regimens are indicated, in the case of transient insulin therapy, insulin pump treatment, for a dietary care plan, for the indication of bariatric surgery, in the event of the appearance of a complication, and for the coordination of care within centres specialising in the management of foot injuries.
