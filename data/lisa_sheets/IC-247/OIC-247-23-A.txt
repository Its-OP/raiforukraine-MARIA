Multifactorial management of T2DM means taking into account all the CV risk factors present in the patient.

In addition to controlling blood sugar levels, therapeutic objectives will include stopping smoking, controlling lipid levels and blood pressure, and adhering to dietary rules, physical activity and taking medication.

Therapeutic objectives (glycaemia, blood pressure, lipids) are tailored to the patient's clinical and biological profile.


The factors to be taken into account when determining the glycaemic target (HbA1c) are the duration of diabetes, life expectancy, the existence of co-morbidities, the risk of hypoglycaemia [[Hypoglycaemia SD-209]] or other adverse drug reactions [[Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or treatment SD-348]] and the patient's motivation.


Lipid control targets are mainly adapted to cardiovascular risk (primary prevention, presence of FDR, secondary prevention), blood pressure targets to cardiovascular and renal risk (GFR, proteinuria).
