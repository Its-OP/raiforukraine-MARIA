'''''<u>TREATMENT</u>'''''

====First steps====
-Peripheral venous access

- 0.9% saline rehydration

- Biology: venous pH, bicarbonates, ionogram, creatinine, protidemia, haematocrit, CRP

- Search for an infectious outbreak

- Systematic ECG

====Curative treatment====
In diabetology or intensive care in the event of serious signs.

After recovering the kalaemia and creatinine:

- Continuous infusion of rapid or ultra-rapid insulin: 0.1 U/kg/h, not exceeding 7 to 8 U per hour, ''FOR AS LONG AS THE CETOSIS Lasts:''.

*If blood glucose < 2.5 g/l and ketonemia positive: maintain insulin flow rate + add 10% glucose (2l/24 hours)
*Switch from IV insulin to subcutaneous insulin when ketonemia has disappeared+++''.

- rehydration with isotonic saline solution

- addition of potassium as soon as kalaemia is < 5 mmol/l

- fever may only appear secondarily when ketosis is resolved.

====''<u>PREVENTION</u>''====
Patient education :

*Systematic acetone testing if blood glucose is high + intercurrent pathologies or nausea.
*If blood glucose levels are high and ketone levels are positive: the patient must know how to add rapid insulin.
