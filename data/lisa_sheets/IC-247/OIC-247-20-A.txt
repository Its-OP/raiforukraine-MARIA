The standard treatment for type 1 diabetes is intensified insulin therapy: injection of slow-acting insulin and several injections of rapid-acting insulin each day, or use of an insulin pump. [Prescription of insulin therapy, follow-up consultation, education of a type 1 diabetic patient SD-280]]

Intensified insulin therapy reduces glycated haemoglobin and delays and reduces the severity of micro- and macroangiopathic complications. It does, however, increase the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.

The objectives of treatment are a compromise between ensuring the freest possible life and preventing acute or chronic complications of the disease.

Therapeutic education'' is necessary to empower patients in the self-management of their disease, and must take into account the experiences of patients and their families.

Recommended glycaemic targets for non-elderly type 1 diabetics :

0.9-1.20 g/L in the morning on an empty stomach

Before meals 0.8-1.2 g/L

2 hours after meals 1.2-1.8 g/L

1.2 g/L at bedtime

''At 3 a.m. > 0.8 g/L

''HbA1c < 7%''

These general objectives must be personalised to the situation of each patient, respecting a compromise between glycaemic control, the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and quality of life. [Hypoglycaemia SD-209; Hypoglycaemia in adults and children.
