- calculation of the anion gap if hyperglycaemia with positive ketonemia: (Na<sup>+</sup> + K<sup>+</sup>) - (Cl<sup>-</sup> + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>).

- osmolarity calculation if hyperglycaemia with negative ketonemia: (Na<sup>+</sup> + 13) Ã— 2 + Gly in mmol/l

- Venous pH

''<u>Aetiological aim</u>''
