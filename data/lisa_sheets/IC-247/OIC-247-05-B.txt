Pre-pregnancy diabetes is defined as the presence of diabetes prior to pregnancy.

Pre-pregnancy diabetes includes type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which by definition are present before pregnancy.

Gestational diabetes is defined as glucose intolerance that becomes apparent and/or develops during pregnancy. It is diagnosed using an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between the 24<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy. [[Gestational diabetes]]
