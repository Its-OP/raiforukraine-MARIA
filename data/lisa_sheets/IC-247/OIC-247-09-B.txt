Type 2 diabetes is characterised by poor use of insulin by the body's cells. It is linked to impaired insulin secretion capacity (relative insulinopenia) and insulin resistance.  

Hyperglycaemia itself (glucotoxicity), lipotoxicity and the presence of chronic low-grade inflammation all contribute to impaired insulin secretion.

Several factors are involved in the impairment of insulin secretion capacity, including genetic predisposition.

Insulin resistance is favoured by environmental factors, including a sedentary lifestyle and overeating.

The presence of metabolic syndrome and android obesity increases the cardiovascular risk of people with type 2 diabetes.
