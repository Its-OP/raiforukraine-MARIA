'''Primary prevention'''

- glycaemic control and management of associated risk factors (hypertension, smoking) [[Hypertension in adults and children]]; [[Smoking in men and women 2C-075-PE-A02]].


'''Prevention from the microalbuminuria stage'''

- blood sugar control: HbA1c < 7%.

- blood pressure control: < 140/85 mm Hg;

- use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (sartans)

- management of all associated risk factors (smoking, dyslipidaemia)

- the low-protein diet: 0.8 g/kg per day and moderate salt intake (6 g per day)


At the macroalbuminuria stage

- blood pressure control: < 140/85 mm Hg.

- reduce the rate of proteinuria to below 0.5 g/24 h.

- check at 6 months that microalbuminuria or proteinuria has subsided or stabilised


'''At the stage of renal failure [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children]]''''

- the HbA1c target is < 8% if the estimated filtration rate is < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ;

- for a GFR between 30 and 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, adapt the doses, particularly of metformin

- from stage 4 onwards (GFR < 30ml/min/1.73m2), the only authorised anti-diabetic classes (MA) are insulin, repaglinide, α-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors in appropriate dosage and certain GLP-1R agonists.

- monitoring glycaemic control

- control of blood pressure < 130 mm Hg

- refer to the nephrologist


At all stages, avoid situations that could accelerate the progression of kidney disease:

- avoid NSAIDs [[Principle of proper use of medicines and non-drug therapies]]

- limit injections of iodinated contrast media
