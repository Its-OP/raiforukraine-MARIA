Diabetes includes conditions characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia.

The definition of diabetes is based on the risk of long-term retinopathy. This risk was established on the basis of the results of epidemiological studies, which showed a risk of retinopathy for fasting blood glucose levels in excess of 1.26 g/l (7 mmol/l).
