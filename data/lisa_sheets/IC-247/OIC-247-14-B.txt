'''Coronary artery disease'''

- Targeted questioning to look for clinical angina, sometimes with atypical symptoms: digestive, asthenia, hypotension....

- Systematic annual resting ECG [[Performance and interpretation of an electrocardiogram (ECG) SD-185]], coronary calcium score

- '''±''' Test for myocardial ischaemia: stress test, stress ultrasound, myocardial scintigraphy

Carotid disease

- Questioning and auscultation of the carotid arteries

- Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries (MRI angiography if there is an auscultatory abnormality) in the event of symptoms suggestive of TIA on examination. Some people (who have not reached a consensus) feel that this should be done systematically every 2 to 5 years if the cardiovascular risk is high (particularly if there is associated hypertension).

'''Arteriopathy of the lower limbs'''

*Examination for symptoms of intermittent limb claudication (SD-069). inspection of the feet, search for pulses, auscultation of arterial paths;
*measurement of the systolic pressure index (SPI)
*Doppler ultrasound of the arteries of the lower limbs (from the abdominal aorta) only if a patent clinical abnormality is observed (no systematic Doppler ultrasound).
