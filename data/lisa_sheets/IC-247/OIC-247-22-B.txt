Carbohydrate intake is defined for each patient on the basis of weight, eating habits, glycaemic profile and insulin regimen.

The diet should be varied and divided into 3 main meals, supplemented if necessary by 1 or 2 snacks. Snacks are essential during intense physical activity.

The main aim of dietetics in type 1 diabetes is to avoid excessive fluctuations in blood sugar levels, either through the consumption of products with a high glycaemic index or through an inadequate intake of carbohydrates at meals or during physical exercise, which could lead to hypoglycaemia. [[Hypoglycaemia SD-209]]; [[Hyperglycaemia SD-208]]

Patients must learn to take sugar again in the event of hypoglycaemia.

Regular physical activity promotes a better metabolic balance. It requires education to avoid hypo- and hyperglycaemia at the time of sport and/or afterwards. A clinical assessment is necessary when resuming an activity after a long period of inactivity.

Diabetes can cause personal and family distress. Psychological support can improve metabolic control.
