All monoarthritis is septic arthritis until proven otherwise!

'''Clinical:'''

-Most often acute monoarthritis with varying degrees of fever, local inflammatory signs (redness, heat) and total functional impotence.

-Search for a possible infectious route of entry

-Favouring factor: immunodepression

'''Paraclinical:''''

-Biological inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and neutrophil hyperleukocytosis

-Joint puncture should be performed systematically in the event of any suspicion of septic arthritis

Joint fluid analysis :

Inflammatory joint fluid cloudy (> 2000 leukocytes/mm3) or puriform (> 50000 leukocytes/mm3), rich in neutrophils which are often altered

Identification of the pathogen by direct examination and/or culture
