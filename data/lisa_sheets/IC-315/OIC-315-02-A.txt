There are two main categories of acute leukaemia:

- Acute myeloblastic or myeloid leukaemia (AML), the frequency of which increases with age (median age at diagnosis 70), accounting for around 3,500 cases a year in France.

- acute lymphoblastic or lymphoid leukaemia (ALL), with two peaks in incidence: in children under the age of 15; then in adults over the age of 50 (median age at diagnosis 18); ALL accounts for a third of childhood cancers and around 1,000 cases per year in France. B-lymphocytic ALL (B-ALL) and T-lymphocytic ALL (T-ALL) have been described.
