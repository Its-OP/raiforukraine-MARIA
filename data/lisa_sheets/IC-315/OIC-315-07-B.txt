Positive diagnosis is based on morphological/cytological examination of the tissue of origin, the bone marrow, by bone marrow aspiration. This examination leads to a positive diagnosis of the disease based on a cytological examination (myelogram showing a rich marrow with a marrow infiltrate â‰¥ 20% blasts, which is usually sufficient to differentiate between AML and ALL, although immunophenotyping is sometimes necessary for this), and enables immunophenotypic (AML, ALL-B, ALL-T), cytogenetic (analysis of leukaemic cell chromosomes) and molecular (gene analysis) characterisation of the disease blasts using various complementary techniques.
