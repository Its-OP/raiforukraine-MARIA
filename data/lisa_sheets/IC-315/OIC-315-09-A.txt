* Symptoms set in within 2-3 weeks
* AEG: specific or non-specific fever, anorexia, asthenia
* = '''results of bone marrow invasion'''

# blastic infiltration of the haematopoietic system (+ extrahematological) = manifestations of the tumour syndrome
#* bone pain, lameness;
#* hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, peripheral adenopathies, tonsillomegaly, large testicle, infiltration of the gums;
#* respiratory discomfort or even superior cava syndrome in the case of mediastinal tumour syndrome;

2. secondary bone marrow failure

** anaemia: asthenia, pallor, possible dyspnoea;
** thrombocytopenia: cutaneous-mucosal haemorrhagic syndrome, petechial purpura, diffuse ecchymosis or ecchymosis in unusual sites, epistaxis, gingivorrhagia, haematuria, blood in the stools.
** neutropenia: prolonged fever, recurrent sore throat or sore throat that does not respond to antibiotics, mouth ulcers.

<br />

* Certain "signs of acute complications" must be identified and treated as a matter of urgency:
** Respiratory distress: mediastinal compression, pleuropericardial effusion, pulmonary leukostasis syndrome (capillary obstruction, PAH, pulmonary oedema).
** DIC: in hyperleukocytic leukaemia (>100 Giga/l) or promyelocytic AML;
** Renal failure: due to renal infiltration or tumour lysis syndrome (hyperleukocytic leukaemia or Burkitt's leukaemia).
** Impaired alertness, headache: cerebral leukostasis in hyperleukocytic leukaemia.
