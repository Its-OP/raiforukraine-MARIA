The aetiological factors are unknown in the majority of cases.

Certain factors increase the risk of AML:

- history of exposure to toxic substances: cancer chemotherapy, benzene hydrocarbons, etc.

- previous exposure to ionising radiation: radiotherapy, occupational exposure, etc.

- genetic anomalies: trisomy 21, mutations in genes giving rise to constitutional family predispositions

- evolution of a chronic myeloproliferative syndrome or a myelodysplastic syndrome

In a similar way, certain factors expose patients to an increased risk of ALL: toxic substances (pesticides and solvents), constitutional genetic abnormalities, progression of chronic myeloid leukaemia, and finally viral agents (EBV, HTLV1 and HIV) which expose patients to rare subtypes of ALL.
