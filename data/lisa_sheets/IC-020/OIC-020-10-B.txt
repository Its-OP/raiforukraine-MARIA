Probability models random phenomena whose possible outcomes are known, but whose value cannot be predicted because their realisation is uncertain.

A ''random variable'' is a function that assigns a number to all possible outcomes. It can be discrete (e.g. gender) or continuous (e.g. blood glucose level).

The ''probability law'' describes the probability associated with each value of a discrete random variable, or the probability associated with any interval of values of a continuous random variable.

By observing the outcomes of a random variable over sufficiently large series (for example, a large number of individuals), it is possible to determine their frequencies and then estimate the probability law governing the variable.
