Justifying the usefulness and relevance of a study is based on an analysis of the literature. Useful arguments for defining a research problem:

- '''epidemiological''' (frequency, severity of the health problem studied, risk factors, costs, etc.).

- current state of knowledge'' (plausible pathophysiological hypothesis, low level of evidence from previous studies, contradictory results from studies available in the literature, etc.).

It is all of these elements which justify the hypothesis put forward "a priori" by the researcher (cf. [[Research Hypotheses 2C-020-DE-B02]]) and which he wishes to verify via this study. They are described in the rationale of a clinical study protocol (cf. [[Health research methodology]]), or in the introduction to a scientific article.
