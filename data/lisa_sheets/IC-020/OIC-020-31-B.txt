*Human genome: the DNA sequence of an individual.
*'''Exposome''': all the environmental factors to which an individual is exposed during his or her life
*'''Phenome''': all the observable characteristics of an individual
*'''Data -omics from molecular biology'''
**Example:
***epigenome: all the epigenetic modifications in a sample
***transcriptome: set of RNA transcripts in a sample
***proteome: all the proteins synthesised in a sample
***metabolome: all the metabolic products synthesised in a sample
***microbiome: all the micro-organisms that colonise an individual

<br />

*Care data from the hospital information system integrated into health data warehouses.
**Example:
***clinical examination
***drug prescriptions/administration
***medico-administrative data (PMSI)
***medical imaging
***medical biology
***data from sensors and medical devices (oximeter, EEG, ECG, etc.)
***anatomopathology
***other paraclinical examinations
***reports (consultations, examinations, procedures, hospitalisation, etc.)

<br />

*'''Environmental data'''
**Example :
***climate data (e.g. Airparif)
***Social networks (connection data, likes, images)
***Search engine data (e.g. Google Trend)

<br />

*'''Data from connected objects (quantify self), m-Health''''
**Example:
***connected glucose meter
***connected scales
***connected watches
***smartphones

<br />

* '''Data collected as part of the SNDS (Système National des Données de Santé)'''
** the Système National d'Information Inter Régimes de l'Assurance Maladie (SNIIRAM), which includes all ambulatory care reimbursement data
** data from hospitals and other health establishments (PMSI)
** statistical data on causes of death (CépiDC)
** data relating to disability
