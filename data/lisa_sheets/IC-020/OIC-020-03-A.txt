Clinical research is regulated by legislation, principally in France by the Public Health Code (which defines the legal framework for clinical research and the obligations of those involved) and the Jardé Law (which defines Research Involving the Human Person - RIPH).

The ''Jardé Law'' (2012, coming into force in 2016) distinguishes three categories of research organised and carried out on human beings with a view to developing biological or medical knowledge:

- '''Interventional research (RIPH category 1)''': this involves an intervention on a person that is not justified by his or her usual care and is not devoid of risk (these are essentially studies on the efficacy and safety of medicines or medical devices).

- ''Minimal risk and minimal burden interventional research (category 2 MHIR)'': this involves the addition of one (or more) intervention(s) to standard practice, the performance of which entails only minimal risks and minimal burden for the person undergoing the research (it excludes research on medicinal products and medical devices, which falls within the scope of category 1, even if the medicinal product/device is used on a routine basis).

- '''Non-interventional research (RIPH category 3)''': Research in which all procedures are carried out and products used in the usual way, in accordance with current practice, without any additional or unusual diagnostic, treatment or monitoring procedures, and without any additional risks or constraints.

'''''Be careful not to confuse "experimental" with "interventional" '''''

*''<u>All experimental studies are interventional</u>, but there are interventional studies that are not experimental''
*''The definition of an interventional study is based on the regulatory framework: some observational studies may be interventional if certain data collection methods are used specifically for the study (and not on a routine basis), or even if the patient's medical monitoring schedule is modified, for example....'' In this case, ''the study may be described as interventional (without being experimental, as there is no change in the nature or levels of the exposure factor)''.

Role of the ''promoter'': the natural or legal person who takes the initiative to conduct the research, manages it and ensures that it is funded. They are legally responsible for the research. All RIPH must be promoted.

Role of the investigator: the individual who directs and supervises the conduct of research at a site, in accordance with the protocol.

'''Information and consent''' of research participants: Individuals must be informed prior to any inclusion in research. This information must be appropriate, complete, fair and comprehensible. In the case of studies involving human subjects, informed consent must be obtained for category 1 or 2 RIPH, or non-opposition for category 3 RIPH, prior to any inclusion.

Role of the ''Comité de Protection des Personnes'' ('''CPP''', there are around forty in France): made up of health professionals (doctors, pharmacists, methodologists/biostatisticians) and people from civil society, it checks that the research complies with the conditions set by law and issues a decision-making opinion on the <u>scientific validity and ethical aspects</u> of the research. All RIPH must be authorised by a CPP before it can begin.

Authorisations from other structures or bodies (CNIL, ANSM, etc) are also required before an RIPH can be launched. The nature and complexity of obtaining these authorisations depends directly on the category of RIPH.


'''Non-IPHR research''': research that does not belong to any type of IPHR does not fall within the scope of the Jardé law. It is not therefore subject to authorisation by a CPP, but when it involves the use of individual personal data, it must be submitted to the CNIL. This is particularly the case for research based on retrospective data already collected during treatment or previous research, research into cosmetics, satisfaction surveys linked to treatment or not, experiments in the human and social sciences in the health field, evaluations of the way in which health professionals practise, teaching practices in the health field, etc.
