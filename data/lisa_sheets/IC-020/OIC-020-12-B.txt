In health research, the characteristics studied are "biomedical" criteria, which by definition are variable. The studies enable a sample of these variables to be observed. Statistical tests are used to conclude whether the observed result can (null hypothesis), or cannot (alternative hypothesis), be explained by chance (due to sampling fluctuations) by determining a priori a threshold for the risk of making a mistake in concluding that the result is not due to chance (alpha risk of 1<sup> species</sup>, often set at 5%).

The interest of a study is not its raw results but its "inference" (extrapolation of the results observed on a sample to the population from which it is drawn). The risk of being wrong (due to sampling fluctuations) can be quantified by statistical tests and the estimation of confidence intervals.

In science, the "hypothetico-deductive approach" consists of formulating hypotheses and then testing their validity by conducting experiments and collecting data.

'''Null hypotheses and alternatives:'''

In statistics, a hypothesis test is a procedure for deciding between two hypotheses:

*''The null hypothesis'', noted H0: This is the hypothesis which we seek to reject, but which we want to have ''little chance'' of rejecting if it is true. For example: the effect of treatment A is the same as the effect of treatment B''. The ''first order risk'', noted "alpha", is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (P(reject H0 | H0 true)). By convention, we often set the first-species risk at 5%.
*'''The alternative hypothesis''', noted H1: This is the complementary hypothesis to the null hypothesis, which we seek to accept. ''Continuation of the example: the effect of treatment A is different from the effect of treatment B''. '''The second-order risk''', noted "beta", is the probability of not rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (P(rejection H0 | H1 true)). The ''power'' of the test is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the alternative hypothesis is true (1-beta).

'''Power of a statistical test'''

A statistical test is designed to be as powerful as possible for a fixed first-species risk (often 5%). The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:

|One-tailed or two-tailed test
|If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.

In practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).

'''Stages of a statistical test:'''

A statistical test is always based on the following steps:

*Define the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis
*Set the risk of error of the first kind.
*Reduce what should often be observed if the null hypothesis were true, and thus determine a rejection zone for the null hypothesis.
*Verify whether or not what is observed in the study is consistent with what would be expected under the null hypothesis.
*If what is observed is consistent, the result of the test is the non-rejection of the null hypothesis (which does not mean that the null hypothesis is true, because the beta risk is never zero). If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is no significant difference.
*If what is observed is not consistent, the result of the test is the rejection of the null hypothesis. There is always a risk of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis (the alpha risk), but in this case we are allowed to conclude in favour of the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, we conclude that there is a significant difference.
*Calculate the significance level (see item 20_29).

'''Single or bilateral test:''''

When the null hypothesis corresponds to equality, the alternative hypothesis can be constructed in two ways:

*bilaterally: the alternative hypothesis then corresponds to a difference, whatever its meaning. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B OR the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A''.
*unilaterally: the alternative hypothesis corresponds to a difference in a single direction. For example: ''the effect of treatment A is greater than the effect of treatment B. It cannot be concluded that the effect of treatment B is greater than the effect of treatment A.''A difference that is not significant bilaterally may be significant unilaterally.

'''Independence or matching of observations:'''

In a study, totally independent or paired measurements can be collected:

*When each measurement is obtained in different and independent individuals, all measurements are totally independent. For example: ''blood glucose measurement 7 days after inclusion in the study ⇒ measurements all independent.''
*When certain measurements are obtained from the same individual, or from different but matched individuals (for example in a case-control study), these measurements are said to be matched. For example: ''blood glucose measurement at inclusion then 7 days after inclusion in the study ⇒ two paired measurements in the same individual.''

Statistical tests for independent data or paired data are not the same (but are based on the same steps as those described above).

'''Parametric and non-parametric tests:''''

Each statistical test has its own conditions of application. Certain conditions of application are based on the probability law of the underlying random variables being analysed.

A parametric test is based on a certain hypothesis concerning the probability distribution. For example, a Student's t test is based on the assumption that the random variable being analysed follows a normal distribution.

A non-parametric test makes no assumptions about the probability distribution.

'''Choice of statistical test:''''

The choice of statistical test depends on :

*the type of ''endpoint'' (called the variable to be explained or the dependent variable)
*the type of ''exposure factor'' (called the independent or explanatory variable)
*The structure of the data studied: ''independent'' or ''matched''.
*The ''sample size'' (≥ 30 or < 30) and the statistical ''distribution'' of the variables (normal or not) when they are quantitative:
**A parametric test is only feasible if certain conditions are met (sample size ≥ 30, normal distribution of the variable, etc.).
**If this is not the case, a non-parametric test must be performed.
