|Title=Basic knowledge of sources of error and bias
|Description=Know how to define/recognise random sources of error, systematic sources of error, bias, selection bias, classification bias and confusion bias. Know that selection bias in descriptive studies leads to a loss of representativeness. Be familiar with the special case of attrition bias, be familiar with the special case of recall bias, and know how to define and identify bias and confounding factors. Knowing the role and knowing how to define and recognise adjustment, matching, stratification and restriction. Be able to define and recognise the specific features of bias depending on the study design. Be familiar with the main sources of bias.

There are two sources of error in estimating a parameter:

* <u>Random error</u>, due to sampling fluctuation.  Causes a decrease in the precision of estimates. Depends on sample size, the larger the sample size, the more precise the estimates.
* <u>Systematic error</u> (bias), not due to chance. The presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. The presence of major bias invalidates the results of a study. Independent of sample size

'''Three major families of bias''' :

* <u>Selection bias:</u> linked to the choice of method of selection and/or follow-up (attrition bias linked to lost to follow-up in longitudinal studies) of subjects, leading to the sample analysed ultimately corresponding to a population different from the target population. It therefore threatens the representativeness and external validity of the study.
* <u>Bias of classification</u>: linked to the measurement of exposure and/or the judgement criterion. The reality of an individual's status (for example, really obese) is not correctly collected in the study (because the scales used to weigh him are faulty and systematically give 3 kilos less). Memory bias is an example of information bias linked to the unreliability of self-reported data.
* <u>Confusion bias</u>: related to the fact that the observed relationship between an exposure factor and the health phenomenon studied may be distorted by not taking into account a third factor (confounding factor) itself associated with both the exposure factor and the phenomenon studied.

'''Selection and information biases relate to <u>descriptive and analytical objectives</u>.'''

* They may lead to an over- or under-estimation of measures of frequency and measures of association.
* They result from errors (avoidable or not) committed by the investigators (diagnostic errors, wrong choice of control group, refusal of participation of eligible subjects, lost to follow-up in a cohort...). <u>They must be identified and controlled at the time of protocol preparation, and cannot be corrected at the time of analysis</u>.

'''Confounding biases relate only to <u>analytic objectives</u>.'''

* They may lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the measures of association.
* They do not arise from errors made by the investigators, but reflect the nature of things. They should be <u>anticipated when planning the study</u> (restriction of inclusion criteria, matching, randomisation if possible, collection of potential confounders, etc.) <u>and can be corrected in the analysis</u> (stratification, adjustment, etc.).
