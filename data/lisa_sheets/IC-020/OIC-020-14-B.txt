<br />Adjustment is a method of statistical analysis used to take account of one or more ''confounding factors'' (a third factor linked to both the exposure being investigated and the occurrence of the health phenomenon being studied).

A measure of adjusted association is often the result of a ''multivariate analysis method'' (such as linear regression, logistic regression or a Cox model) which makes it possible to identify the exposure factors studied which are ''independently'' linked to the phenomenon studied (judgement criterion), taking account of confounding factors (their effect is neutralised), i.e. to identify the impact of the exposure factors studied, all other things being equal.

Unadjusted measures of association are referred to as gross.

<nowiki>Example: the following table is taken from "Prado et al, Lancet Oncol 2008, 9:629-35" and presents crude (Univariate analysis) and adjusted (Multivariate analysis) hazard ratios measuring the association between the presence of sarcopenia (exposure factor studied) and survival (endpoint) in obese patients with respiratory or digestive cancer. The association between sarcopenia and survival in these patients was significant in univariate analysis, with a crude HR of 2.4 (IC95%=[1.5-3.9]). This association remained significant after adjustment for functional status, cancer location and stage with an adjusted HR of 4.2 (CI95%=[2.4-7.2]).</nowiki>
