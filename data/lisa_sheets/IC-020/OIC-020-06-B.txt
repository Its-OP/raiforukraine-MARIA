The choice of study methodology depends on the objective being pursued.  To assess the suitability of these methods, it is therefore crucial to define this objective precisely:

*<Specify the question asked</u> :
**The outcome criterion(s).
**The ''exposure factor(s)'' studied, if any.
***risk factors in analytical studies (cf. [[Risk factor, etiological factor, prognostic factor, health determinants, exposure factor 2C-020-DE-A04]])
***experimental intervention in experimental studies
**The '''target population (cf. [[Target population and source, sample 2C-020-DE-A05]])''''

*<Specify the approach</u> :
**'''observational''': the nature and level of the exposure factors to which the subjects included in the study are subjected are not modified.
**experimental'': subjects are subjected to an experimental intervention which would not have taken place, or not under the same conditions, or not at the same time, if they had not been included in the study.

*<Specify the aim of the study:
**'''descriptive studies (descriptive studies)''': always observational, their aim is to describe the distribution or changes in the frequency of health events and their determinants in the population.
**'''explanatory studies''' '''(analytical studies)''': always observational, their aim is to identify the existence of an association between a risk factor and a health phenomenon.
**Experimental studies'': the approach is experimental by definition, the exposure factor studied is an experimental intervention carried out for the study (controlled by the experimenter) whose effect on a health phenomenon is to be evaluated. When they are randomised, controlled and correctly conducted, they have the highest level of evidence to establish a causal link between the exposure factor (drug, surgical or screening strategy, health promotion intervention, etc.) and the health phenomenon (death, recovery, relapse, onset of disease, etc.). (cf. [[Causality judgement criterion and level of evidence of the various studies 2C-020-DE-A14]] and [[Analysing and using the results of clinical studies from the perspective of good use - critical analysis, clinical research and levels of evidence (see item 3)|Item 323 - Analysing and using the results of clinical studies from the perspective of good use - critical analysis, clinical research and levels of evidence (see item 3)]]).
**studies designed to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic or screening method (diagnostic studies)'': always observational, the aim is to evaluate (or compare) the performance of one (or more) clinical or paraclinical test(s) (between them) for the screening or diagnosis of a health phenomenon.<br />''Studies designed to evaluate the performance of a diagnostic or screening method (diagnostic studies)'': always observational, the aim is to evaluate (or compare) the performance of one (or more) clinical or paraclinical test(s) (between them) for the screening or diagnosis of a health phenomenon.<br />
