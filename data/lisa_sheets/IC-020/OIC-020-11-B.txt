'''Description of qualitative variables''': number and proportion (or percentage) of each mode

'''Description of quantitative variables''' :

# Position parameters :
#* Average: sum of the values divided by their number.
#* Mode: among a set of values, the mode is the most frequently found value.
#* Quantiles: if values are ordered, the quantiles are the values which divide these values into parts of equal size. Examples of quantiles are the median (divides values into 2 parts of the same size), quartiles (divides values into 4 parts of the same size) and percentiles (divides values into 100 parts of the same size).  
# Dispersion parameters :
#* Variance and standard deviation: The variance measures the dispersion of a set of values around their mean. It is the average of the squares of the deviations from the mean. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
#* Interquartile distance: difference between the third and first quartile.
#* Range: difference between the maximum value and the minimum value.
