'''Exposure factor''': this is the factor of interest in an analytical or experimental study.

* In an experimental study: it is the intervention (the drug, medical device, preventive intervention, etc.) to which study participants are exposed (or not) in an experimental manner.
* In an analytical study, it is called a '''risk factor''', i.e. a factor associated with a higher probability (statistical and <u>non-causal</u> definition) of the presence or occurrence of the health phenomenon under study (judgment criterion). Example: yellow fingernails and lung cancer.
** In an etiological study, a risk factor is called an '''etiological factor''' when its causal nature for the health phenomenon studied is implied/supposed/proven. Example: smoking and lung cancer.
** Similarly, in a prognostic study, a risk factor is called a ''prognostic factor'' when its causal nature for the health phenomenon studied is implied/assumed/proven. Example: metastatic lung cancer and mortality.

'''Health determinants''': factors which influence the state of health of populations, without necessarily being direct causes of particular problems or illnesses.
