The existence of a statistically significant association does not prejudge the causal nature of the relationship between an exposure and a health phenomenon. While experimental studies can provide proof of causality, observational studies can only discuss the plausibility of this causality, in the light of the "Bradford Hill causality criteria":
{| class="wikitable"
| colspan="2" |'''BRADFORD HILL CAUSALITY CRITERIA''''
|-
|Criteria '''internal''' to the study
|Statistical association between exposure and the phenomenon studied

Strength of the association

Dose-effect relationship

Specificity of the relationship

Minimisation of selection and ranking bias. All known confounding factors are correctly taken into account.

Absence of temporal ambiguity (exposure must precede the phenomenon studied)
|-
|Criteria "external" to the study
|External consistency: consistency between study results

Biological plausibility (known pathophysiological mechanism)

Consistency with in vitro and animal studies

Parallel geographical gradients in exposure and the phenomenon studied

Decrease in the incidence of the phenomenon studied when exposure is eliminated or reduced
|}
<small>*The criterion of specificity of the relationship between exposure and the phenomenon studied is very convincing when it is present but is absent most of the time even if the causal relationship is very plausible. It is now accepted that an effect can be multi-causal (environment, genetic, etc.) and therefore the specificity of the relationship is no longer an essential causality criterion</small>


The different types of study therefore do not have the same demonstrative value in terms of causality, which translates into ''a different level of evidence'' (classification proposed by the Haute Autorité de Santé, cf [[Argumenter les niveaux de preuve des principales sources d'information 2C-323-PE-A03]]):
{| class="wikitable"
