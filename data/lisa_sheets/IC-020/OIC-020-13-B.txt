Survival data" is a generic term used to describe the time until the occurrence of any event (death, relapse, appearance of a metastasis, etc., but also hospital discharge, extubation, recovery, etc.). They therefore reflect both the occurrence (or non-occurrence) of the event and the follow-up time of the subject, known as ''survival time''. They are also called "censored variables" because of their incomplete nature:

* If the event occurs, the survival time is the time after which the event occurs (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and death).
* When the event is not observed during follow-up, there is ''censoring'': the survival time is then equal to the time during which the subject was observed (for example, the time elapsed between inclusion in the study and the end of the study). If an individual is ''lost to view'' before the end of the study (e.g. following a move abroad), this is also considered as censoring. In these cases, the survival time of the subject is the time between inclusion in the study and the subject's last follow-up visit. It is not equal to the time until the occurrence of an event because it was not observed, but it provides information on the fact that during the entire follow-up period, the event did not occur for this subject.

Methodologies adapted to this incomplete nature are therefore needed to take account of this censoring of survival time.

The Kaplan-Meier method can be used to estimate survival at each time t (probability of not knowing the event before t) and can therefore be represented graphically in the form of a ''survival curve'' as in the figure below.

A survival curve starts at 1 (no subject has yet experienced the event at time 0, so the probability of survival at time 0 is 1) and then decreases over time as the event occurs for each subject in the sample (staircase). The vertical lines represent censures, i.e. the last visit of individuals lost to follow-up. The ''median survival'', which is the time after which 50% of the individuals in the sample experienced the event (it may be unknown if less than 50% of the individuals experienced the event), is often used to describe the survival of a sample. In this example, it is 6 months.

The log-rank test is used to compare (univariate) the survival curves of two (or more) samples.
The hazard ratio is an estimate of the instantaneous risk of the event occurring over time. It is interpreted as a relative risk. The value observed in a sample is always accompanied by its confidence interval. It can be estimated in a multivariate (adjusted) analysis, most often using a regression model known as the Cox model.
