The ''power'' of a study is its ability to reject the null hypothesis when it is false (see [[Statistical tests: principles of hypothesis testing 2C-020-DE-B09]]). This is most often the ability to show a difference if it exists (in a randomised superiority trial), or an association if it exists (in a cohort or case-control study). More rarely, power may be the ability to show an absence of difference (non-inferiority trial or equivalence trial).

The power of a statistical test is influenced by several parameters:
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Parameter'''
|'''Influence on power''''
|-
|Size of sample analysed N
|If N increases, power increases
|-
|Difference to be detected d
|If d increases, power increases
|-
|Variability of observations (variance)
|If variance increases, power decreases
|-
|Alpha risk
|If alpha increases, power increases
|-
|One-tailed or two-tailed test
|If the test is one-tailed, the power increases.

In practice, the only parameters that can really be controlled in a biomedical study are the alpha risk (which is set), the construction of a one- or two-tailed test, and the sample size (determined by calculating the number of subjects required).
