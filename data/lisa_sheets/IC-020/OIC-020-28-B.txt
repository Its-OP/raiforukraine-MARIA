'''Interaction''': occurs when the association between an exposure and a health phenomenon varies according to the level of another factor (= '''effect modification''), called the interaction factor.

* The interaction factor must not be confused with a confounding factor: the presence of a confounding factor can produce (or amplify) the association under study even though it does not exist, or mask (or reduce) it when it does exist.
* To take account of an interaction factor, we can perform :
** a stratified analysis,
** equivalently, the introduction of an interaction term into a multivariate model.
* The interaction test is necessary to determine whether the effect is modified in a statistically significant way, i.e. whether there is a significant difference in the association between the levels of the interaction factor (the null hypothesis is the absence of interaction, the alternative hypothesis is the existence of an interaction).
* Example: Study evaluating the association between smoking and lung cancer (fictitious figures):

'''Confusion factor'''

Sex is a confounding factor here: when stratified by sex, the association between smoking and lung cancer decreases, but the estimated RR is approximately the same in each stratum.

The fact of inhaling smoke is an interaction factor here: the estimate of the association between smoking and lung cancer is not at all the same depending on whether or not the smoke is inhaled.
