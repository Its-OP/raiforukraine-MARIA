'''Extrinsic properties of the test''': depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied.

* <u>Positive predictive value (PPV)</u> of a test: probability of being ill if the test is positive.
* <u>Negative predictive value (NPV)</u> of a test: probability of not being ill if the test is negative.

'''Intrinsic properties of the test''': do not depend on the prevalence of the disease in the population studied.

* <u>Sensitivity of a test (Se)</u>: probability of having a positive test if one is ill.
* <u>Specificity of a test (Sp)</u>: probability of having a negative test if one is not ill.
* <u>Positive likelihood ratio (PLR)</u>: ratio of the probability of the test being positive in a sick patient to the probability of the test being positive in a healthy patient.
* <u>Negative likelihood ratio (NLR)</u>: ratio of the probability that the test is negative in a sick patient to the probability that the test is negative in a healthy patient.

'''Assessment of the decision-making input'''

* <u>Pre-test probability</u> that an individual is ill: formed a priori (implicitly from the subjective impression of the doctor or explicitly from the estimated prevalence of the disease or clinical prediction models).
* <u>Post-test probability</u> that an individual is ill: probability revised a posteriori, based on the results of the test.
* <u>Fagan's nomogram</u>: graphically indicates the post-test probability of being ill from the pre-test probability, the test result and the likelihood ratios corresponding to this result (a way of expressing the intrinsic performance of the test, calculated from its sensitivity and specificity).
