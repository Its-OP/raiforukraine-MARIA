Eating disorders are defined by the existence of "significant" and "lasting" disturbances in food intake.

The notion of a significant threshold, when talking about pathological behaviour, is established by taking into account the <u>cultural context</u>, the <u>intensity of the disturbances</u>, their <u>general medical consequences</u>, the <u>psychic suffering</u> and the <u>social consequences</u>.

The etiopathogenesis of OCD is still poorly understood: it is ''multifactorial in origin'' and linked to

* vulnerability factors'': genetic background and/or pre-existing biological abnormalities
* trigger factors": strict diets, major life events, puberty and oestrogen
* maintenance factors": biological imbalances induced by the disorder, relational benefits in relation to the environment, psychological benefits, etc.
