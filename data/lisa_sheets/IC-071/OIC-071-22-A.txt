* Early detection and treatment of bulimia is difficult because the disorder is often hidden (due to feelings of shame) and there is a significant delay in diagnosis.
* The reason for consultation may therefore be other: dysmenorrhoea, desire to lose weight (when it is normal), sleep disorders, mood instability, etc.
* The principles and objectives of treatment for bulimia are the same as those for anorexia: multidisciplinary (psychiatrist/non-psychiatrist team), prolonged, and primarily outpatient (hospitalisation if serious).
* Therapeutic objectives are individual, taking into account the patient's opinion, and contractually agreed.
* Follow-up should be prolonged and include all areas affected by the disorder and its complications.
