Changes in eating behaviour are initially thought to be adaptive mechanisms in response to psychological stress.

These mechanisms, which are initially beneficial, are quickly overwhelmed and lead to the development of restrictive behaviour with deleterious effects.

Ultimately, these behaviours become long-lasting, leading to real illnesses that can even lead to the patient's death.
