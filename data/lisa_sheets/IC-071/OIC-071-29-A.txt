'''Beginning'''

* Usually begins in childhood.
* Trauma or sexual abuse are more common in the antecedents.
* Dieting is often secondary to the onset of the disorder, unlike anorexia nervosa or bulimia.

'''The hyperphagic attack'''

* Very strong craving, with an irrepressible urge to eat.
* Awareness of the disorder with significant psychological distress.

'''Associated features'''

* Anxiety-depressive symptoms, possibly comorbid with generalised anxiety disorder or a characterised depressive episode.
* Possible association with addictive disorders and impulse control disorders (self-mutilation, kleptomania, etc.).
* Personality disorders.
* Strong impulsivity and difficulty managing emotions.
* Sexual dysfunction.

'''Retentissement'''

* Digestive disorders: halitosis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, bloating and abdominal pain, alternating diarrhoea and constipation, etc.
* Hepatic steatosis.
* Indirect repercussions: all complications of obesity must be systematically investigated and treated.
* Poor nutritional status, even malnutrition.
* Hypofertility or even infertility.
