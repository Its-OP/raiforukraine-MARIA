Psychiatric semiology (DSM-5 criteria)

* Recurrent episodes of uncontrolled hyperphagia. This means :
** eating well above average, for example in less than 2 hours ;
** associated with a feeling of loss of control over the quantities eaten or the ability to stop.
* These episodes are associated with at least 3 of the following:
** eating much more rapidly than normal;
** eating until there is a painful sensation of abdominal distension;
** eating large quantities of food in the absence of a physical sensation of hunger;
** eating alone because you are embarrassed by the amount of food you are taking in;
** feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty after eating.
* Marked distress linked to the existence of this hyperphagia.
* Episodes of binge eating occur at least once a week for at least 3 consecutive months.
* The disorder is not associated with the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviours as is the case in episodes of bulimia and does not occur exclusively during bulimia or anorexia nervosa.
