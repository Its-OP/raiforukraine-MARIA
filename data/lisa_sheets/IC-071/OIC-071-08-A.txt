'''Spontaneous evolution'''

* Mortality (from suicide or medical complications) is the highest of all mental disorders.
* The disorder often progresses to chronicity (chronic anorexia nervosa is defined as having progressed for 5 years) or stagnation.

'''Progress under treatment'''

* Approximately half of patients progress to complete remission.
* 30% to partial remission
* 20-30% progress to chronic disease or death.
* Relapses are frequent (30-50% relapse in the year following hospitalisation).
* Onset in prepubertal children or adults has a poor prognosis.
