After several minutes' rest in calm conditions, orthostatic hypotension is defined by :

A reduction

≥ 20 mmHg systolic blood pressure
* and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 10 mmHg
* and/or systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg

Within 5 minutes of standing.

This search is not very sensitive and must be repeated, particularly in the morning.

NOTE: the presence of suggestive symptoms (frequent lipothymia during orthostatism) despite a negative search may be enough to retain the diagnosis.

Note that the definition does not include:

o nor the presence of orthostatic symptoms (lipothymia, asthenia, falls, etc.);

o or the variation in heart rate which, when it increases by less than 10 beats per minute in orthostatism, should prompt a search for bradycardia treatment (beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, digoxin) and/or underlying dysautonomia.
