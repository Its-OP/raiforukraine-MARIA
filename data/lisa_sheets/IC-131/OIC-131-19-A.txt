No medical imaging examination is systematic. There are various indications for imaging examinations in the context of balance or walking disorders:

1- aetiological investigation of balance or gait disorders, based on clinical examination data, such as :

* Osteoarticular X-rays for osteoarthritis
* MRI or CT scan of the brain, particularly for subdural haematoma, suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke sequelae, lacunar status.
* Spinal cord MRI for cervico-arthrosic myelopathy and/or narrow lumbar canal.
* Specific tests will be requested depending on co-morbidities (neurodegenerative pathologies, heart disease, electromyogram, etc.).

2- in the context of a fall or in the presence of an acute disturbance of balance or gait, according to the clinical examination:

* Osteoarticular X-rays to look for fractures
* Cerebral CT scan as an emergency measure only in the event of neurological symptoms or head trauma treated with antithrombotic drugs (anticoagulant or antiplatelet).
* Cerebral MRI as first-line treatment if stroke suspected and thrombolysis or thrombectomy delayed.
