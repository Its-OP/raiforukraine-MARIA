The clinical examination of gait should be carried out systematically in the elderly, particularly and at least during an initial consultation, as gait disorders can :

*- testify to pre-existing pathologies
*- be at risk of complications
*- require rehabilitation and/or technical aids, or even home help


'''How to proceed:'''

1- Have a space clear enough for the person to walk barefoot for a short distance in a straight line and turn around.

2- Conduct of the examination and inspection of the walk'':

*At the start of walking: astasia-abasia of frontal or lacunar origin, or linked to hydrocephalus at normal pressure.
*Ataxic, lateralized and/or stellate gait of vestibular origin.
*pseudo-ebriated ataxic walking of cerebellar origin
*Ataxic heeling gait of proprioceptive origin
*Spastic walking with mowing of unilateral pyramidal origin
*Spastic spasmodic walking of bilateral pyramidal origin
*Paretic walking with stepping of L4-L5 or SPE origin
*Paretic waddling gait of pelvic origin
*Parkinsonian walking (slow, small steps, loss of arm swing, decomposed U-turn, freezing, festination, kinetic entrapment)
*Apraxic walking (small, shuffling steps stuck to the ground) associated with normal pressure hydrocephalus, frontal damage, subdural haematoma.
*painful claudic gait with gait perimeter of vascular (AOMI) or spinal cord origin
*Walking with an avoidance limp of painful osteoarticular origin
*Walking with deficient limp due to neurological pathology

3- Neurological examination:

*focal motor and/or sensory deficit
*unilateral (stroke) or bilateral (lacunar, spinal cord compression, etc.) pyramidal syndrome (SDS-121)
*Parkinsonian syndrome
*peripheral or central vestibular syndrome (SDD-064, SDD-130)
*cerebellar syndrome (SDD-064, SDD-130)
*radicular syndrome, polyneuropathy (motor skills, sensitivity)
*myogenic or myasthenic syndrome or motor neuron syndrome.

4- Osteoarticular examination to look for gonarthrosis, coxarthrosis (SDD-067, SDD-070).

5- ''Search for a visual deficit, attentional problems''.
