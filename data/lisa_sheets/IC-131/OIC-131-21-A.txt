A care plan must be drawn up


The aim is to avoid or reduce the risk of falls recurring:

- deal with emergencies.

- correct the precipitating factor(s), whether intrinsic or extrinsic.

- manage the ameliorative component linked to predisposing factors.

- implement systematic measures :

* review of all medication
* wearing closed shoes with low, wide heels (2 to 3 cm), thin, firm soles and high uppers (to stimulate proprioception)
* regular walking and/or other physical activity (at least 30 minutes a day)
* correction of any vitamin D deficiency, and investigation and management of osteoporosis (see osteoporosis section)
* prevention or investigation and management of any malnutrition or sensory deficiencies
* Home assessment by the family for simple measures or by an occupational therapist,
* motor physiotherapy if necessary, to be continued as self-education between sessions supervised by a professional
* prescription of a walking aid if necessary
