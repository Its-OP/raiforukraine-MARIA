The signs of the seriousness of a fall are linked to various factors:

A.     Consequences of a fall

B.     Repeated nature of the fall

C.     Causes of falls

D.     Medical and social situations at risk of complications


A- Severity of the consequences of the fall

*'''Traumatic''': Contusions, haematomas, wounds, dislocations, intracranial bleeding; bone FRACTURES (beware of certain fractures which may go unnoticed (geared fractures of the upper end of the femur) or which are difficult to see on standard X-rays (do not hesitate to ask for a CT scan if there is a strong suspicion and the X-ray is normal).
*rhabdomyolysis, dehydration, renal failure and hyperkalaemia, inhalation pneumonitis, hypothermia, bedsores, VTE.
*Psychological: post-fall syndrome or psychomotor maladjustment syndrome (see box), fear of falling, refusal to stand up, depression, loss of functional independence, etc.

'''B- Severity linked to the repeated nature of the fall'''

Repeated falls: defined as at least 2 falls over a 12-month period.

Particularly serious in the event of :

*recent increase in the frequency of falls ("cluster" falls)
*> 3 factors predisposing to falls (cf)
*difficulty walking
*prolonged lying on the ground (>1 hour) after a fall, inability to get up unaided

C- Severity related to the aetiology of the fall

*Cerebrovascular accident
*Cardiac rhythm or conduction disorder / myocardial infarction
*Infectious pathology - sepsis
*Hypoglycaemia
*Hypoglycaemia

'''D-''' '''Gravity related to medical and social situations at risk of complications''''

Linked to medical situations at risk of complications (e.g. treatment with anticoagulants or antiaggregants or osteoporosis) or social isolation
