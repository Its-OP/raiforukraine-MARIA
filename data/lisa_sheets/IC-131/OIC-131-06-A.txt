* At the start of gait: astasia-abasia of frontal or lacunar origin, or linked to hydrocephalus at normal pressure.
* Ataxic, lateralized and/or stellate gait of vestibular origin.
* Pseudo-ebriated ataxic gait of cerebellar origin
* Ataxic heeling gait of proprioceptive origin
* Spastic gait with mowing of unilateral pyramidal origin
* Spastic spastic walking of bilateral pyramidal origin
* Paretic gait with stepping of L4-L5 or SPE origin
* Waddling paretic gait of pelvic origin
* Parkinsonian gait (slow, small steps, loss of arm swing, decomposed U-turn, freezing, festination, kinetic entrapment)
* Apraxic gait (small, shuffling steps stuck to the ground) associated with hydrocephalus at normal pressure, frontal damage, subdural haematoma, etc.
* painful claudic gait with gait perimeter of vascular (AOMI) or spinal cord origin
* Walking with an avoidance limp of painful osteoarticular origin
* Walking with deficient limp due to neurological pathology
