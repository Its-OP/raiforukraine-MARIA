Ageing itself favours the onset of OHT through damage to the baroreceptor, ageing of the arterial wall and reduced aldosterone and renin levels.

HTO is often multifactorial and its aetiologies are numerous, but its aetiological diagnosis must include at least the following:

* IATROGENIA'' +++ to be sought as a priority by tracking down any recent introduction or change in dosage: nitrate derivatives, combination of antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs, L-dopa, anticholinergics, phenothiazine, morphine, etc.
* Hypovolaemia, dehydration: look for any acute pathology that may contribute to this,
* Anaemia'': HTO is a symptom of poor tolerance of anaemia which may justify a transfusion,
* Cardiac failure due to inadequate haemodynamic response to orthostatism,
* More rarely endocrinopathies (pheochromocytoma, dysthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, ante-hypophyseal insufficiency),
* Dysautonomia due to :
** neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's +,
** prolonged bed rest,
** peripheral neurological impairment (diabetes, amyloidosis, alcohol, connective tissue diseases, renal insufficiency, vitamin deficiencies).
