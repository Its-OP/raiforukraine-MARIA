HTO is often multifactorial and its aetiologies are numerous, but its aetiological diagnosis must include at least:

IATROGENIA +++ to be sought as a priority by tracking down any recent introduction or change in dosage: nitrate derivatives, combination of antihypertensives, alpha-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs, L-dopa, anticholinergics, phenothiazine, morphine, etc. * Hypovolaemia, dehydration: look for any acute pathology that may favour their occurrence.
* Hypovolaemia, dehydration: look for any acute pathology that may contribute to their occurrence,
* Anaemia: HTO is a symptom of poor tolerance of anaemia which may justify a transfusion,
* Heart failure due to inadequate haemodynamic response to orthostatism,
* More rarely, endocrinopathies (pheochromocytoma, dysthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, ante-hypophyseal insufficiency),
* Dysautonomia due to :
** neurodegenerative pathologies, in particular Lewy body disease, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's +,
** prolonged bed rest,
