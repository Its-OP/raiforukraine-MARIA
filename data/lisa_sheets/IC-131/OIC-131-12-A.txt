'''Post-fall syndrome is a geriatric emergency. It is characterised by the presence of:'''

*Retropulsion, often making standing impossible without human assistance
*Major anxiety component triggered by standing ("phobia of walking", or even "phobia of standing up");
*Disorder of walking with human assistance: small slipping steps, with heel support and no rolling of the step on the ground, with possible widening of the sustentation polygon, and delayed initiation of walking or "freezing";
*Oppositional hypertonia, impaired postural adaptation reactions and parachute reactions;
*Not explained by traumatic or neurological lesions caused by the fall;
*Not correlated with the traumatic or frequent nature of the fall.

This syndrome has a poor functional prognosis and requires rapid, multidisciplinary treatment (functional rehabilitation, psychological support).
