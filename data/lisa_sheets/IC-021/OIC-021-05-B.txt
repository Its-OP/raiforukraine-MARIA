Definition: A public health priority is not set unilaterally by the health authorities, experts or patients. It is based on a combination of three logics:

- a ''medical and scientific logic'':

- severity (significant morbidity and/or mortality);

- frequency (high incidence).

- an "economic logic":

- socio-economic impact ;

- feasibility (cost, etc.).    

- a ''social logic'':

- perception of the problem ;

- acceptability.

It is the result of work involving the whole of civil society (buy-in from all), but it is the "political decision-maker" who will ultimately validate the public health priority.
