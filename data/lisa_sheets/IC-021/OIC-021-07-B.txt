<br />''Disability-free life expectancy (DFLE)'' or disability-free life expectancy corresponds to the number of disability-free years that individuals in a group would have to live on average under the mortality conditions of a given period (life expectancy minus years of disability). Disability-free life expectancy is also sometimes called "healthy life expectancy" or "health expectancy".

In France, disability-free life expectancy at birth is 64.6 years for women and 63.7 years for men in 2019.
