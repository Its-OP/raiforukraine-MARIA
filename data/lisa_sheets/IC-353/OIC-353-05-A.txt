Suicidal potential should be systematically assessed in psychiatry. It is based on a triple assessment: risk, urgency, dangerousness (RUD)

==Risk assessment
Risk assessment allows us to consider the factors that may influence the occurrence of death by suicide, based on individual, family, psychosocial and other factors.

==Estimacy assessment==
Assess the urgency or imminence of the act: the suicidal scenario, the absence of an alternative to suicide

*Low: thinking about suicide, no specific scenario, just flashes of inspiration
*Medium: scenario considered, but postponed
*High: clearly planned, act planned for the next few days

==Dangerousness assessment
Is based on the potential lethality and accessibility of the means envisaged.
