=== Prevention: ===
* Primary: involves identifying people who are not in a suicidal crisis but who have risk factors that need to be identified. e.g. treatment for depression.
* Secondary: early detection of suicidal crises. e.g. helplines, toll-free numbers, National Suicide Prevention Number 2NPS, etc.
* Tertiary: care for suicidal people, e.g. VigilanS-type recontact systems.

=== The French national suicide prevention strategy is based on 5 pillars: ===
- 3114, the national suicide prevention helpline, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, offering a professional welcome, assessment, intervention and guidance by telephone to anyone in distress, worried about a loved one or bereaved by suicide, as well as to professionals.

- VigilanS, a scheme to prevent suicidal recurrence, which offers people who have attempted suicide an active suicide watch (a team is available to contact by telephone if necessary), as well as active recontact (calls, postcards).

- Preventing suicidal contagion, by improving media coverage of suicidal behaviour, reducing the consequences of suicides in institutions (postvention) and preventing hotspots (public places known for the number of suicides that occur there).

- Training those involved in suicide prevention and deploying sentinels (citizens particularly involved in identifying people at risk)

- Communication for the general public

=== '''Effective suicide prevention measures''': ===
- Restricting access to resources

- Making the media more accountable

- Adopting alcohol policies

- Early identification and treatment

- Training health workers

- Follow-up care and community support
