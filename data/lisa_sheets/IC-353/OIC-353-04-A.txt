==Child==
Suicidal ideas and intentions are possible from the age of 5-6.

TS less frequent than in adolescents.

The main methods used were hanging/strangulation and defenestration.

'''Specific clinical signs:''''

How SDIs are expressed depends on the child's developmental level.

* Aspecific signs of distress: externalized manifestations (irritability, unusual agitation, tantrums), internalized manifestations (withdrawal, isolation), developmental regressions (e.g. secondary enuresis), pain, functional signs and a drop in school performance.
* More specific signs of suicidal crisis: endangerment, exaggerated preoccupation with death.

'''Specific risk factors:''''

- Personal factors :

* Personal history of TS.
* Personal psychiatric disorders (in particular depressive disorders, behavioural disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders (in particular ADHD and ASD).
* Emotional isolation.
* Emotional dysregulation (particularly in the context of impulsivity).
* Chronic illness or disability


- Family factors, life events and psychosocial factors :

* A family history of TS.
* Family conflicts and parent-child interaction problems.
* Experiences of abuse and neglect.
* Harassment.
* Psychiatric and/or substance use disorders in a parent.
* Placement in an institutional setting (children in the care of the ASE).
* Belonging to a cultural or sexual minority.


Family support is a major factor in protecting children from suicidal crises <br />.

==Adolescents
Do not trivialise thoughts of suicide. Requires intervention and prevention.

Most frequent form: deliberate drug intoxication.

'''Specific clinical signs:''''

How SDIs are expressed depends on the adolescent's developmental level.

The suicidal crisis may occur in the context of a drop in school results, an attraction to marginality, and risky behaviour (substance use, risky sexual behaviour, self-inflicted injuries, anorexia or bulimia, and endangerment on the public highway).

'''Specific risk factors:''''

In addition to the risk factors linked to clinical and environmental characteristics detailed in the previous section on suicidal crisis in children, we can add certain factors such as dropping out of school and romantic break-ups.

As in the case of children, family support is a major factor in protecting adolescents from suicidal crises.

==Adult==
Suicidal ideation: rarely expressed or overt.

Manifestations of crisis'': boredom, feelings of loss of role, uselessness, failure, injustice, being out of step, loss of investment in work, relationship difficulties, difficulties with the hierarchy, repeated work stoppages or over-investment in work, repeated visits to the doctor because of aspecific symptoms (pain, feeling tired, etc.).

'''Vulnerability factors:''' precarious marital, social or professional situations, conflict at work or professional harassment, an addictive disorder, psychiatric disorders, disabling, chronic, painful or serious general medical conditions, situations of violence, narcissistic injury, immigration.

==Elderly person==
Suicidal thoughts rarely expressed. Risk of trivialisation.

Atypical manifestations of the crisis: withdrawal, refusal to eat, lack of communication, loss of interest in activities, refusal of care.

'''Vulnerability factors:'''' characterized depressive episode almost always found, other psychiatric disorders (particularly alcohol use disorder and personality disorders), disabling general medical conditions, pain, social isolation, conflicts, abuse, change of environment, widowhood.

==Suicidal crisis in a psychopathological context==
Suicidal ideation is often easily expressed.

Psychiatric disorders = major risk factors for suicide

Always assess patients suffering from psychiatric disorders

'''Warning signs of increased suicidal risk:'''

*Isolation with a decision to break off usual contact;
*Reduction or cessation of usual activities;
*Increased psychiatric symptoms.
