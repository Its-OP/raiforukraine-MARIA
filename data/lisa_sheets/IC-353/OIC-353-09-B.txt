Open or non-consensual care.

'''Indications for hospitalisation:''''

* to stabilise a patient with a life-threatening prognosis due to the non-psychiatric complications of suicide;
* in the event of a suicidal risk with a high degree of urgency;
* in the event of a suicidal risk with a low or medium degree of urgency associated with decompensated psychiatric disorders.

'''Objectives of the hospital stay:'''

*protect the person by limiting the risk of suicide;
*treat the associated psychiatric disorder;
*facilitate resolution of the crisis (alternatives) by setting up supportive psychotherapy (a relationship of trust, verbalising suffering, working on the therapeutic alliance, etc.);
*organise subsequent outpatient follow-up if necessary;
*complete the psychiatric assessment


Patients must be systematically informed about the terms and conditions of their care (location, length of stay in hospital, how the team works).

A "personalised safety plan" is drawn up with the patient. This safety plan is a list of resources (resource persons, emergency telephone number, calming activities, reassurance techniques, etc.) that the patient can use before and during a suicidal crisis.
