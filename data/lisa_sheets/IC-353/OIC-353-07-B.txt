The interview should take place in a quiet, face-to-face setting. Confidentiality must be guaranteed.

Systematic suicide risk assessment.

*address suicidal thoughts directly, for example: "Are you suffering to the point of having suicidal thoughts?
*identify possible support from family and friends. Contact with the family/significant others, while respecting medical confidentiality, regardless of the treatment proposed.

Suicidal behaviour = psychiatric emergency. '''Do not trivialise'''

Patients should feel free to express their experiences and ideas.
