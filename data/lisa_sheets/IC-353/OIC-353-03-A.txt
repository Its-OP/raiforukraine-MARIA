Patients should always be questioned about the existence of suicidal thoughts and explored.

Suicidal crisis = psychological crisis linked to prior vulnerability and with the onset of suicidal ideation. The outcome may be suicide, with the risk of death.

Meets the definition of a crisis: beginning and end, reversible and temporary.

Occurs when coping strategies are overwhelmed. Absence of choice, the only solution perceived by the individual to put an end to the suffering.

'''Manifestations of suicidal crisis:'''

* ''non-specific symptoms'' from the [[Sad mood/moral pain SD-123|depressive]] or [[Generalised anxiety disorder; Panic disorder; Agoraphobia; Social anxiety disorder; Specific phobias; Separation anxiety; Anxious school refusal 2C-066-DE-A02|anxious]] register; consumption of psychoactive substances (alcohol, illicit substances, tobacco); reckless risk-taking; withdrawal from affection and physical contact; isolation.
* ''more specific worrying ideas and behaviour'': feelings of despair; intense psychological suffering; reduced sense of values; cynicism; taste for the morbid; sudden search for lethal means.


''Vigilance'': ''presuicidal Ringel syndrome''. Corresponds to an apparent calm with a withdrawn attitude, reduced emotional and affective reactivity. Risk of imminent acting out.
