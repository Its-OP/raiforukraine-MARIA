'''PNE''' = ability to release several types of inflammatory mediators in different tissues.

'''Physiological role of these mediators''' = to alter or destroy a wide range of targets, including parasite larvae, viruses and tumour cells.

Cytotoxic and prothrombotic effects of these mediators = damage to tissue infiltrated by PNE (cardiac damage, arterial and/or venous vascular thrombosis).
