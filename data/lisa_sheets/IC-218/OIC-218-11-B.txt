'''In case of hypereosinophilia > 1,500/mm<sup>3</sup> (invasive phase) (serological diagnosis):'''

- toxocariasis (''Toxocara canis'' or ''cati'', ingestion of food soiled with dog or cat faeces, sandboxes), which may be completely asymptomatic, or manifest itself as ''[[Pruritus SD-088|pruritus]]''', digestive or respiratory signs, or a visceral ''larva migrans'' syndrome (all organs may be affected, parasitic impasse). Ocular and cerebral localisations can be severe.


'''In cases of more moderate eosinophilia (< 1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, digestive parasitoses without tissue cycling or tissue parasitoses of long-standing establishment)''''''':'''''

- oxyurosis (''Enterobius vermicularis''), manifested by anal ''[[Prurit SD-088|prurit]]'', particularly in children. Diagnosis is based on the ''scotch-test''.

- taeniasis (''Taenia saginata'', ingestion of raw or undercooked beef), manifested by digestive signs (dyspepsia).

Other parasitoses can cause eosinophilia, particularly during the invasion phase: ascariasis, bilharziosis or shistosomiasis, echinococcosis, etc.
