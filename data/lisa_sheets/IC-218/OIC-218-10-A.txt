'''Differentiate:'''

- drug-induced eosinophilia = often asymptomatic or associated with a non-severe skin rash ;

- DRESS, defined by the association of a cutaneous rash which may not be severe (''[[Erythema SD-085|erythema]]'''), a hypereosinophilia > 1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, general signs (fever '''([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|fever/hyperthermia]])''', adenopathies '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]]''')'') and visceral involvement which may be severe (fulminant hepatitis or '''[[Acute renal failure - Anuria|acute renal failure]]''' related to immuno-allergic interstitial nephropathy).

Eosinophilia + medication

- onset after introduction of suspect drug: 2 to 8 weeks ;

- monitor creatinine levels and liver function tests (transaminases and prothrombin levels) until eosinophilia disappears, even if the rash is not severe, to identify DRESS.
