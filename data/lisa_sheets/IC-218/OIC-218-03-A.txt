'''NB Helminthoses or helminthiases may be used interchangeably'''

'''Helminthoses''' =

- These are the main parasitoses responsible for eosinophilia, especially during the invasion and tissue migration phase of the parasite (ascariasis, anguillulosis, schistosomiasis, etc.).

- possible peaks in eosinophilia associated with the migration of anguillaria larvae at a distance from the primary infection (endogenous self-infestation cycle): anguillulosis

Intra-luminal protozoan parasites (e.g. giardiosis, amoebiasis, cryptosporidiosis, etc.) = no eosinophilia.
