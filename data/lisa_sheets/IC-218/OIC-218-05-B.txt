'''Hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES)''' '''clonal'''' = linked to a clonal abnormality directly affecting the eosinophilic lineage (bone marrow).

'''In favour of clonal (= myeloproliferative) SLE:''''

- splenomegaly (if no other cause) ;

- increase in vitamin B12 and/or serum tryptase ;

- cortico-resistance.

'''Two types of SHE:''''

- Myeloid HES = myeloproliferative syndrome (clonal abnormality of the eosinophilic lineage).

- Lymphoid SHE = T lymphocyte clones producing cytokines (IL-5 in particular) leading to hypereosinophilia. Evocative signs: elevation of total IgE and good response to corticosteroid therapy.
