== '''Atopy''' ==
- moderate eosinophilia (< 1000/mm<sup>3</sup>) (above 1500/mm<sup>3</sup>, look for a cause other than atopy);

- anamnesis data (history of atopy) and clinical context (asthma, spasmodic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, urticaria);

- allergological work-up sometimes useful for confirming the diagnosis: skin tests (prick tests) to allergens (pollen, house dust mites, moulds, animal dander, etc.) to demonstrate IgE-mediated sensitisation to one or more allergens.

== '''Drug-related causes''' ==
- Any blood eosinophilia ('''[[Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or SD-348|suspicion of an adverse drug reaction]]''') should be investigated;

- Potentially all drugs can be incriminated;

- by frequency: beta-lactams, sulphonamides, NSAIDs, heparins, iodinated contrast products, anti-epileptics, allopurinol, antiretrovirals and neuroleptics;

- eosinophilia is sometimes massive, but may be discovered by chance and be asymptomatic;

- sometimes a non-severe rash ('''[[Erythema SD-085|erythema]]''') ;

- sometimes severe clinical manifestations: severe drug hypersensitivity syndrome, or DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms)

== '''Haemopathies and cancers''' ==
- solid cancer or haemopathy to be systematically evoked in the presence of eosinophilia;

- especially if there is a change in general condition ([[Asthenia SD-021|''asthenia''']], ''[[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]]'''), clinical signs of appeal (pain, functional abnormalities, palpable mass, adenopathies '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]]]''....), or inflammatory syndrome '''([[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]])''' ;

- in particular Hodgkin's disease (eosinophil + ''[[Pruritus SD-088|pruritus]]]''' ;

- cutaneous T lymphomas (Sézary syndrome = aggressive form of cutaneous T lymphoma characterised by the triad erythroderma, lymphadenopathy and circulating atypical lymphocytes called Sézary cells), or systemic ;

- depending on the context: blood calcium levels, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography (CT); bone marrow investigations (myelogram, bone marrow biopsy); lymph node or tissue biopsy.
<br />

== '''Systemic diseases''' ==
- GEPA : Altered general condition ('''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]], [[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]]'''); fever '''([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|fever/hyperthermia]])'''; asthma usually severe; sinusitis or nasosinus polyposis ; single or multiple mononeuropathy; cardiac involvement; inflammatory syndrome, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) with anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) specificity (inconstant); and pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT;

- bullous dermatoses (bullous pemphigoid) ;

- rheumatoid arthritis ;

- adrenal insufficiency.
