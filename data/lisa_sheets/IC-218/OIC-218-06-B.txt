'''Eosinophilia + asthma :'''

- Fernand Widal syndrome (or triad): nasosinusal polyposis with asthma in association with acetylsalicylic acid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

- ''Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis'' (GEPA, formerly Churg-Strauss vasculitis): severe asthma with late onset, pulmonary infiltrates on computed tomography (CT), nasosinus polyposis, then systemic manifestations of vasculitis.

- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) (type I hypersensitivity (IgE mediated) to colonisation by Aspergillus fumigatus): long-standing asthma, cough and expectoration of bronchial moulds (mycelial plugs). Signs suggestive of the disease: very marked elevation of total serum IgE; massive hypereosinophilia; various chest X-ray images; presence of specific anti-Aspergillus IgE.

- LÃ¶ffler's syndrome'' (migration of larvae into the lung parenchyma): asthma or ''[[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]]''', ''[[Cough SD-167|cough]]''', fever, labile radiological infiltrates, often peripheral.
