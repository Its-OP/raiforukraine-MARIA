Gynecomastia is common and transient in boys.

The development of pubic (P2) or axillary (A2) hair appears secondary to the development of the breasts in girls or the testicles in boys. Any development of pubic or axillary hair prior to the development of breasts in girls or testicles in boys should rule out an adrenal pathology (see pubarche premature below).
