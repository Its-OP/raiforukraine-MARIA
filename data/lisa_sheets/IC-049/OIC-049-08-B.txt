Puberty is triggered hypothalamically: reactivation of the GnRH (''Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone'') pulsatility. GnRH stimulates the anteropituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone). The appearance of this pulsatility is modulated by neuroendocrine and peripheral factors, in particular leptin produced by adipose tissue, genetic and ethnic factors, nutritional status and intercurrent pathologies.

In boys, FSH is responsible for the growth of testicular volume, while LH stimulates the production of testosterone, which is responsible for the development of secondary sexual characteristics (penis, hair) as well as musculoskeletal changes.

In girls, LH and FSH lead to ovarian activation and the production of oestrogens, which cause mammary, uterovaginal and OGE development, followed by the appearance of the first menstrual periods (menarche).

Pubic hair is linked to the production of gonadal and adrenal androgens.

The increase in sex hormones increases the frequency and amplitude of growth hormone (GH) secretion peaks, and the speed of statural growth accelerates (pubertal growth peak).
