The appearance of isolated early pubic hair (premature pubarche or adrenarche) is most often linked to the physiological increase in adrenal androgens around the age of 8.

It is a diagnosis of elimination, which requires a pathological production of androgens of adrenal or gonadal origin to have been ruled out: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal tumour, gonadal tumour.

Early and isolated breast development (absence of pubic hair, absence of accelerated growth rate) before the age of 2 is often physiological (premature thelarche). It is not related to activation of the gonadotropic axis. It is a diagnosis of elimination, made after suggesting true precocious puberty.

The term menarche refers to the first menstrual period.
