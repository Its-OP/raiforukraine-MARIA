The typical ''premature thelarche'' in girls under 2 years of age most often begins in the perinatal period, with breast development progressing relatively little thereafter. If there is any doubt, a simple pelvic ultrasound showing prepubertal internal genitalia will suggest the diagnosis of isolated ''premature thelarche''.
