Precocious puberty is a pathological condition defined by breast development before the age of 8 in a girl or an increase in testicular volume before the age of 9 in a boy. Advanced puberty (between the ages of 8 and 9 in girls and 9 and 11 in boys) is a borderline situation which occurs at a non-early age but which may affect the prognosis for adult height.
