Sex steroids: testosterone in boys, oestradiol in girls

Gonadotropins: baseline FSH and LH (stimulation test unnecessary), distinguish between central pubertal delay/simple pubertal delay (low FSH and LH) and peripheral pubertal delay (high FSH and LH)

Other anterpituitary hormones: TSH, T4L, IGF-1, cortisol, prolactin (rule out multiple anterpituitary insufficiency)

Anti-transglutaminase IgA and total IgA

Blood ionogram, urea and creatinine.

In cases of central hypogonadism: hypothalamic-pituitary and olfactory bulb MRI;

In case of peripheral hypogonadism: blood karyotype (search for Turner syndrome in girls and Klinefelter syndrome in boys).

Delayed puberty is more common in boys than in girls. Delayed puberty is most often idiopathic in boys (simple delayed puberty, often with a family history of delayed puberty) and organic in girls.
