Sex steroids: testosterone in boys, oestradiol of little contribution in girls.


Inhibin B: increased during puberty in boys.


Gonadotropins: basal FSH and LH and after stimulation (LH-RH/GnRH test). Used to diagnose and distinguish between central (detectable LH, peak LH) and peripheral (undetectable LH) precocious puberty.


Bone age: assessment of bone maturation (onset of puberty=sesamoid at 11 years in girls and 13 years in boys). It is most often advanced in early puberty.
