'''2/ ERADICATION of H.pylori: not urgent.'''

 if possible guided by antibiotic susceptibility testing or characterisation of the "H.pylori" type by PCR

 if no antibiogram or PCR (most frequent in practice): probabilistic treatment


Eradication checked by breath test at least 4 weeks after stopping antibiotics and at least two weeks after stopping PPIs (PPIs cause false negatives).
