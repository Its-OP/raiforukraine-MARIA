'''Imbalance between defence mechanisms and factors that attack the gastric and duodenal mucosa ('''Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, stress, '''Helicobacter pylori'', Tobacco)
[[File:Protection and aggression factors.jpg|vignette]]

Protection factors

           - Pre-epithelial: mucus (mechanical barrier),

           - Duodenal bicarbonates (Buffering)

           - Epithelial: cell renewal

           - Subepithelial: mucosal vascularisation

'''Aggression factors'''

a) ''Helicobacter pylori'' (''H.Pylori''):''' flagellate gram-negative bacillus, resistant to gastric acidity through urease activity. Contamination in childhood via the oral or faecal-oral route.  High prevalence in developing countries and in older populations (cohort effect).

- Incidence has been falling over the last 30 years.

- Causes chronic gastritis with atrophy, metaplasia and sometimes dysplasia. Increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma (less than 1% of patients with H. pylori, peak 60-70 years).

'''b) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):''' reduced secretion of prostaglandins (a protective factor for the digestive mucosa), leading to an increased risk of ulcers. RR of 4 for NSAIDs and 1.5 for aspirin. Selective NSAIDs (COXibs) have a lower risk of developing UGD.

'''c) Zollinger Ellison syndrome''' (exceptional) ''':''' gastric acid hypersecretion related to tumour hypergastrinemia. Sporadic pancreaticoduodenal neuroendocrine tumour in 75% of cases or more rarely associated with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). To be considered in cases of multiple or recurrent duodenal ulcers, often complicated, associated with chronic diarrhoea due to gastric hypersecretion (i.e. secretory hypersecretion) which improves or disappears with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

'''d) Other causes and/or contributing factors: smoking, Crohn's disease, vasculitis, infections in immunocompromised patients (tuberculosis, CMV), intense metabolic stress (intensive care, burns), tumours.''' Look for ulcers unrelated to HP and/or NSAIDs (10-20% of cases).

'''Mechanism of ulcerative digestive haemorrhage'''

Ulceration of the vessels of the gastroduodenal wall. In the case of severe haemorrhage: most often, ulceration of the peptic artery in the case of bulbar ulcers, or of the left gastric artery in the case of gastric ulcers''''.


The risk factors for complicated ulcers are :

- Age over 65

- A history of complicated peptic ulcer disease

- Taking NSAIDs or aspirin, particularly in cases of associated H. pylori infection.

- Taking anticoagulants.
