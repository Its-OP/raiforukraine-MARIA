It is customary to separate gastritis according to 3 criteria:

- The cause: (see below)

- Location of lesions in the stomach: antral, fundic, pangastric

- Type of anatomopathological lesions: glandular atrophy, metaplasia, presence or absence of pathogens, etc.

For example: atrophic antral gastritis without metaplasia linked to H. pylori

It should be noted that dyspepsia and gastroparesis are separate entities related to functional and motor disorders of the stomach; they are not gastritis.
