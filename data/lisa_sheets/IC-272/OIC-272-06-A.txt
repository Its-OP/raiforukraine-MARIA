- H.pylori infection is routinely tested for in endoscopic gastric or duodenal ulcer lesions. This test is performed on gastric biopsies taken during diagnostic endoscopy.

- '''Other indications for testing for H.pylori infection'':''' long-term use of NSAIDs, 1st degree family history of stomach cancer, MALT lymphoma, unexplained martial deficiency, prior to bariatric surgery (bypass) and dyspepsia. In indications that do not justify endoscopy, H.pylori infection is detected by a non-invasive test (serology), usually a respiratory test++ (see table).
