'''There is no criterion for the severity of ulcer pain''', there is no anatomo-clinical parallelism. The signs associated with a complication are as follows:

- Abdominal defence or contracture (perforation)

- Haematemesis (or initial malaise), blood on rectal examination (only performed if there are signs suggestive of haemorrhage)

- Drop in blood pressure, tachycardia (haemorrhage)

- Presence of a melena

- Weight loss, left supraclavicular adenopathy (cancer)
