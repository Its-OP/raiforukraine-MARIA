1) Emergency measures :

hospitalisation and immediate prescriptions :

à Diagnosis: biological work-up with CBC, Rh group RAI, haemostasis (PT, aPTT), blood ionogram, creatinine, discuss blood gases depending on clinical condition.

à Therapeutics :

      - General measures: admit the patient to a specialised unit (intensive care unit or resuscitation unit). Perfusion with a good calibre venous line, oxygen therapy, continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, filling and transfusion according to haemodynamics and haemoglobinaemia.

à If upper GI haemorrhage is suspected, because of the frequency of the main causes, portal hypertension and ulcer, intravenous treatments can be started before the GI endoscopy (proton pump inhibitor PPI electric syringe and/or octreotide) as detailed below.

à The recommended target haemoglobin level is discussed in cases of upper GI haemorrhage. The recommendations are to achieve a haemoglobin level of 7 to 9 gr/dl, with a higher threshold in the case of cardiovascular co-morbidities in excess of 9 gr/dl. In the case of ruptured oesophageal varices, the threshold is 7 to 8 gr/dl.


2) Specific management of haemorrhage other than that associated with portal hypertension

   - Oesogastroduodenal endoscopy allows haemostasis procedures to be performed.

   - IVSE proton pump inhibitors: it is recommended that they be started before the endoscopic procedure.


3) Specific management of haemorrhage associated with portal hypertension :

a) Endoscopic mechanical haemostasis: ligation of oesophageal varices and/or glue sclerosis of gastric varices

b) Reduction in splanchnic blood flow to reduce the porto-cava pressure gradient: octreotide (IVSE).

c) Prevention of infections (swallowing pneumonia, ascites) by antibiotic prophylaxis for >7 days (quinolone or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid)


 In the event of haemorrhage caused by uncontrollable rupture of oesophageal or gastric varices, nasal catheters or balloon tamponades (Blakemore or Linton catheters) can be inserted. These are life-saving procedures while awaiting other treatments. It is also possible to fit a liver prosthesis to relieve portal hypertension (shunt between the portal system and the vena cava=TIPS).


4) Prevention of recurrent haemorrhage

Secondary prevention of oesophageal variceal ruptures: There are two treatments to be combined

- Eradication of oesophageal varices by iterative ligation until they have disappeared

- Combined with non-cardio selective beta blockers

- Prevention of recurrence of ulcer haemorrhage:

- Eradicate Helicobacter pylori (Hp) if the ulcer lesion is linked to Hp.

- Stopping gastrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs) in Hp-negative ulcers
