Treatment of facial paralysis with frigidity ([[Facial paralysis SDD-127|facial paralysis]]) must be undertaken as a matter of urgency:

* Prescription of oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/d) for 7 to 10 days. Early initiation (< 72 hours) increases the chances of recovery ([[Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SDD-251|prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids]]).

* Systematic prevention of ocular complications (keratitis, revealed by ocular pain) ([[Ocular burning sensation SDD-141|ocular burning sensation]]) :

- Prescription of artificial tears

- Occlusive dressing at night if palpebral occlusion is insufficient

- In the most severe forms, temporary tarsorrhaphy.
