1) Favourable outcome: by far the most common, particularly when paralysis is initially incomplete. Recovery begins 8 to 15 days after onset, and is generally cured in less than 2 months.

2) Unfavourable trend :

* 5 to 10% of cases. Possible sequelae are :

- Residual synkinetic movements

- Post-paralytic facial hemi-spasm, resulting in a brief (often repeated) contracture of the eyelids and cheek of the hemi-face (treatment with botulinum toxin injections) ([[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|localised or generalised muscle contracture]]; [[Abnormal movements SDD-126|abnormal movements]]; [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|palpebral anomalies]]).

- Crocodile tears" syndrome (watering during meals), rare and secondary to aberrant reinnervation.

* Severe persistent deficit, with disabling deformity of the face and absence of reinnervation on ENMG (discussion of cosmetic surgery) ([[Muscular weakness SDD-074|Muscular weakness]]; [[Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Sensory and/or motor deficit]]).
