1) The different functions of the facial nerve :

- Motor, main function: innervation of all the skin muscles of the face and neck, as well as the stapedial muscle of the middle ear.

- Vegetative: secretion from the lacrimal and salivary glands.

- Sensory: innervation of the skin of the concha of the ear (Ramsay-Hunt zone).

- Sensory: gustation for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

2) The search for an anomaly consists of :

- Look for a muscular deficit in one hemiface ([[Muscular weakness SDD-074|muscular weakness]]; [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SDD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]; [[Facial paralysis SDD-127|facial paralysis]]) at rest, with spontaneous mimicry, and during movements on command:

- Upper face: raise and frown the eyebrows (forehead crease), close the eyes against resistance ([[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|palpebral anomalies]])

- Lower face: uncover teeth, puff out cheeks

An asymmetry can be confirmed by comparison with a previous photograph. Facial muscles innervated by cranial nerves other than the facial nerve are examined normally: masticatory muscles (trigeminal nerve), muscles of the pharynx and soft palate (glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves), muscles of the tongue (greater hypoglossus nerve).

- Testing sensitivity in the Ramsay-Hunt zone.

- Test the quality of lacrimal and salivary secretions (Schirmer test) and taste function on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue (application of sweet, salty, acidic and bitter solutions).
