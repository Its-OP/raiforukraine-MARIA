1) In the case of central facial paralysis ([[Facial paralysis SDD-127|facial paralysis]]), cerebral imaging is essential and MRI is the examination of choice, performed without and with injection of gadolinium in the absence of an acute neurovascular context or contraindication.

2) In the case of PFP :

- The indication for brain imaging depends directly on the suspected cause:

o Brain MRI: depending on the context, diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, brainstem stroke, or tumour if other cranial nerves are affected (brainstem glioma, cerebellopontine angle tumour, skull base metastasis).

o Cerebral scan: in the event of trauma (fracture of the rock) ([[Traumatisme crânien SD-172|traumatisme crânien]]), in the event of purulent ear discharge (mastoiditis), or to identify tumour invasion of the bone at the base of the skull.

- Other: Cervical CT/MRI with injection if swelling homolateral to the PFP (parotitis, parotid tumour) ([[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]]).
