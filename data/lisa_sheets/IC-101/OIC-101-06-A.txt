These arguments generally make it easy to diagnose facial palsy with frigidity ([[Facial palsy SDD-127|facial palsy]]):

- Mode of onset, in the morning on waking or after exposure to cold (travel), immediately maximal or progressing over a few hours.

- Isolated, severe facial involvement (other cranial nerves unaffected).

- Associated symptoms are usually absent in cases of PFP of other origin: retro-auricular pain in the preceding hours, sometimes with a sensation of numbness in the half-face, hyperacusis ([[Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|sensory and/or motor deficit]]; [[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]]).
