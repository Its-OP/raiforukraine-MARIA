In the event of a suspected cast complication, at the very least a wide opening should be made and, more often than not, the cast should be removed as a matter of urgency.

An inspection of the immobilised area is carried out, followed by an examination of the extremities, a loco-regional examination and a search for general signs.

'''Compartmental syndrome'''

The diagnosis is clinical. Measurement of intra-compartmental pressures can confirm the diagnosis in cases of doubt, but should not delay treatment. Surgical fasciotomy must be performed as a matter of urgency. The skin is left open and will be closed once the oedema has subsided.

Thrombo-embolic complications

A venous Doppler ultrasound is performed to look for deep phlebothrombosis. If there is chest pain, tachycardia or respiratory signs, an angioscan should be performed urgently to look for a pulmonary embolism.
