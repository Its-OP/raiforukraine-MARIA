When a complication is suspected under plaster :

* At the very least, a wide opening should be made and, more often than not, it should be removed as a matter of urgency.
* the diagnosis of compartment syndrome is clinical (see above). Measuring pressure helps to confirm the diagnosis, but should not delay treatment, which should be carried out as a matter of urgency. Any delay in treatment increases the risk of sequelae.

The patient was referred to the operating theatre for emergency surgical fasciotomy of all the compartments of the limb segment in question. The skin is left open and gradually closed once the oedema has subsided.
