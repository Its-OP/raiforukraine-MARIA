The aim of plaster cast support is to maintain a joint or skeletal segment safely, either temporarily or until the injury has healed.

'''2 main types of limb immobilisation''' :

*Circular plaster
*Plaster gutter generally surrounding the posterior half of the limb

'''Extent of the immobilisation''' :

*to immobilise a fracture, the contention must in principle take the joints above and below the fracture.
*to immobilise a joint, the restraint should in principle take hold of the bone parts above and below the fracture.

With few exceptions, the extremities are left free to allow them to be mobilised and to monitor their sensitivity and active mobility.


'''The position of immobilisation of the limb''' :

*Must be specified before starting to make the cast and must not be altered. Must maintain limb in functional position:
**upper limb: elbow at 90° flexion, intermediate pronation and wrist in neutral extension, thumb in opposition.
**on the lower limb: knee at 10° flexion, ankle at 90° to the leg skeleton, and varus hindfoot.
*In paediatric orthopaedics, different positions can be used temporarily and then quickly replaced by a more physiological position.


'''The making of plaster''' :

* An appropriately sized tubular jersey is used, without folds, with a layer of synthetic wadding to protect potentially dangerous protruding areas, nerve tracts and vascular axes.
* Bone contours must be carefully moulded, without leaving any impressions.

'''After an acute trauma'''

*a circular cast is made for orthopaedic treatment or as a complement to internal osteosynthesis surgery, and must be split immediately from one end to the other; or
*or a splint is made immediately.
