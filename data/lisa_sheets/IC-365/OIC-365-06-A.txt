'''Compartmental syndrome'''

* Very intense, disproportionate pain that is not relieved by painkillers
* Tense, painful muscle masses
* Pain increased by passive muscle tension
* Distal paresthesias and hypoesthesias due to ischaemic damage to the nerve passing through the compartment concerned.
* Distal pulses normally present

Thrombo-embolic complications

* Calf pain under restraint
* General signs: tachycardia, fever
* Edema of the foot and cyanosis of the extremities

'''Local compressions'''

Cutaneous and infectious complications :

* Local ischaemia responsible for bedsores, arthritis, osteitis, scar disunions, etc.
* immobilisation is soiled and foul-smelling, with local pain, proximal adenopathy and fever.

'''Neurological compressions'''

Search for sensitivity disorders (paresthesias, dysesthesias), localised pain or a motor deficit (examples: median nerve at the wrist, ulnar nerve at the elbow, fibular nerve at the neck of the fibula).
