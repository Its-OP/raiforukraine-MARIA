'''As soon as phlebothrombosis is clinically suspected'' :

*The cast must be bivalved or completely removed.
*A clinical examination is carried out without looking for the Homans sign, which could displace a fracture.
*A venous Doppler ultrasound examination is carried out as a matter of urgency to confirm the diagnosis.
*A pulmonary embolism should be suspected in the presence of abnormal anxiety, chest pain or a drop in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and an angioscanner should be performed as a matter of urgency.

'''Recommendations give priority to the use of subcutaneous LMWH (see item 226)'''

For patients with a strong clinical suspicion, anticoagulant treatment is started before the diagnosis is confirmed by imaging.
