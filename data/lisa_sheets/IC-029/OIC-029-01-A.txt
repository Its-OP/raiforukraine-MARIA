Since the early 1980s, the age of first pregnancy has been falling, but more importantly, female employment has been rising. In 2010, 70% of women were in work during part of their pregnancy. Of the 800,000 pregnancies, almost 560,000 children a year are born during a pregnancy in which the mother is in work (Insee data).

Numerous studies have been carried out to determine whether occupational exposure to an external agent could pose a risk to the unborn child. For some of these agents, the risk has been proven. For others, the suspicion may be well-founded, particularly in the case of chemical substances, based on animal models.

'''The consequences'''

Certain maternal occupational exposures can lead to:

- malformations,

- abortions,

- premature births,

- growth retardation (certain organic solvents),

and in the longer term :

- neurobehavioural disorders (lead, ethanol),

- damage to fertility as a result of ''in utero'' exposure

- cancer (in 2009, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) concluded that there was a risk of leukaemia in children whose mothers had been occupationally exposed to paint before and during pregnancy).

There is some debate as to whether exposure to chemical substances during pregnancy can damage the child's immune system or disrupt its endocrine system. Paternal pre-conceptional exposure may also be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

The scientific literature has shown the importance of the exposure period. The critical periods vary according to the health events studied. Generally speaking, we can say that :

- Damage to the gametes (spermatozoa and oocytes) of future parents can occur at any time in the life of a man or woman, and even during foetal life.

- The most vulnerable period is the periconceptional period and the first three months of pregnancy (major teratogenic risk).

- Breastfeeding can lead to exposure of newborns and infants during their development.
