The malaise may involve to varying degrees :

* Changes in tone: hypotonia or hypertonia
* Changes in colour: cyanosis, pallor or erythrosis
* Changes in respiratory rhythm: apnoea, bradypnoea, polypnoea
* Changes in consciousness or abnormal movements

The examination must be rigorous, starting with a search for signs of severity requiring immediate resuscitation measures.
