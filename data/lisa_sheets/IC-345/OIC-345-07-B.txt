- Personal and family history, allergies, treatments, lifestyle, childcare arrangements, eating habits, etc.

- Depending on age: progress of pregnancy, childbirth, adaptation to life outside the womb, risk factors for maternal-foetal infection, etc.

- Rigorous examination of the health record (weight curves, vaccinations, etc.)

- Circumstances of the illness: notion of trauma, toxic intake. BEFORE (what was the child doing) DURING (precise description of the illness) AFTER (how did the child recover).

- Associated signs: fever, respiratory signs, digestive signs
