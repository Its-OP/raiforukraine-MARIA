Key points:

Lithiasis results in induration in the canal in which it is located, and has the following consequences:

*mechanical events
**Salivary hernia
**Salivary colic

*infectious events
**Sialodochite: whartonite
**Perisialodochite: peri-whartonite
**Sialadenite: submandibulite

Diagnosis is clinical and may involve ultrasound or endoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic sialendoscopy).

Inflammation of the gland is called "sialadenitis", and inflammation of the excretory duct is called "sialodochitis". Lithiasis rapidly leads to sialodochitis (whartonitis for the submandibular gland), which may in turn develop into sialadenitis (submandibulitis or parotitis).

<u>'''Mechanical events''</u>

● ''salivary hernia'':

- painful swelling of the gland at the start of the meal,

- jet of saliva at the orifice of the canal at the end of the meal

● ''salivary colic'': pain along the canal opposite the lithiasis

Salivary calculi can be asymptomatic for a long time, and an infectious event can occur long after the first mechanical signs.

<u>'''Infectious events:'''</u>

They may involve the canal (sialodochitis: whartonitis), the tissues surrounding the canal (floor of the mouth: peri-whartonitis; inside of the cheek: peristenonitis) or the gland (sialadenitis: submandibulitis, parotitis):

*Whartonitis: sharp pain in the floor of the mouth, radiating to the ear and accompanied by fever.
*Periwhartonitis (Figure 1): abscess or inflammation of the pericardium.
*sialadenitis: hot, red, painful swelling of the gland with fever and pus at the ostium of the duct <br />.
