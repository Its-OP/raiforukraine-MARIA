The three main causes of sialitis are viral infections, bacterial infections and lithiasis.

Viral and bacterial sialitis are infections of the gland: sialadenitis. Lithiasis is an obstructive disease of the excretory ducts: sialodochitis.

'''<u>Viral sialitis</u>''''

*Mumps, coxsackie (types A and B), influenza and parainfluenza viruses, cytomegalovirus.
*More often affects the parotid gland than the submandibular gland.
*Bilateral involvement


'''<u>Bacterial sialitis</u>''''

*Most often unilateral
*Typical picture = acute bacterial parotiditis in elderly and dehydrated patients with painful unilateral parotiomegaly + purulent discharge from St√©non's canal.

<u>''Lithiasis sialitis''</u>

*More often affects the submandibular gland than the parotid gland.
*Pain (salivary colic) with irritant inflammation of the canal (Warthonitis) which can spread to neighbouring tissues (peri Warthonitis).
*Obstruction leads to stasis of saliva and secondary enlargement of the submandibular gland (salivary hernia) or even bacterial submandibulitis.

Lithiasis sialodochitis can therefore be complicated by bacterial sialadenitis.
