Salivary gland tumours can be benign or malignant.

The two most common histological types are cystadenolymphoma (Whartin's tumour) and pleomorphic adenoma, which are benign tumours.

*'''<u>Benign tumours:</u>''''
**Warthin tumour or cystadenolymphoma (45 to 55% of all tumours),
**Pleomorphic adenoma (20 to 30% of all tumours).

*'''<u>Malignant tumours:</u>''''
**<u>primitive:</u>
***Mucoepidermoid carcinoma
***Acinar cell carcinoma
***Adenoid cystic carcinoma
**<u>secondary:</u> metastases of cutaneous carcinomas (scalp in particular) and melanomas, kidney cancer, breast cancer.

The risk of malignancy is higher the smaller the gland concerned. The malignant/genic ratio in the parotid gland is around 20/80%, whereas in the accessory salivary glands it is 60/40%.
