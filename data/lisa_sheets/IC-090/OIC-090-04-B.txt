'''<u>Tumour pathology</u>''''

*Ultrasound :
**look for signs in favour of malignancy: heterogeneity, necrosis, irregular contours, adenopathies, high intratumoral resistance index,
**diagnose contralateral lesions,
**guide a cytopunction.
*Parotid MRI :
**systematic,
**T1, T2 sequences, with and without injection of Gadolinium, FAT-SAT sequences, diffusion and perfusion curve,
**The combination of an ADC coefficient <1.2 and a C-type perfusion curve is highly suggestive of malignancy.
*Cervico-thoracic CT scan injected in cases where malignancy is highly probable (adenopathies, skin invasion, involvement of the VII).


'''<u>Lithiasis</u>''''

No imaging is necessary if the clinical picture is typical. Examinations will be requested at a distance from the painful episode, and infectious examinations in the event of diagnostic doubt or recurrence.

*Ultrasound is the examination of choice,
*Non-injected salivary CT scan,
*Sialo-MRI.


'''<u>Sialoses</u>''''

*Ultrasound: to look for diffuse cystic lesions, areas of collection and ductal dilatation.
*MRI: allows the same analysis as ultrasound but with much greater precision.
