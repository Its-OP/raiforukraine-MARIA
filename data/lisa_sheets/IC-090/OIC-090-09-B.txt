The two investigations of choice when faced with a tumour of the salivary glands are :

- '''<u>Injected MRI with T1-T2 perfusion and diffusion sequences:</u>''''

*MRI should be carried out before cytopuncture, as cytopuncture can lead to haemorrhagic changes which can alter the diagnostic performance of MRI.
*The characteristics of the T2 signal, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio and the appearance of the perfusion curve can be used to assess the risk of malignancy.

- <u>'''Cytopunction:'''</u>

*after ultrasound-guided MRI.
*Result given according to the Milan system of 2018: Type I unsatisfactory for diagnosis, type II benign, type III atypia of undetermined significance, type IV neoplasm of uncertain potential, type V suspected of malignancy and type VI malignant.

Biopsies are <u>never</u> performed due to the risk of facial nerve damage and dissemination.

At the end of this assessment, the patient should be seen again to present the results and discuss their significance.

'''The treatment is surgical:'''

<u>'''- Partial parotidectomy'''</u> (''exofacial'' or ''superficial'' if the lesion is in the superficial lobe) with preservation of the facial nerve and '''extemporaneous anatomopathological examination'''.

'''- P<u>total arotidectomy with homolateral cervical evidement</u>'' if malignant on extemporaneous examination.

- Submandibulectomy


- don't forget post-op:

*announcement system,
*discussion in multidisciplinary consultation meetings,
*post-operative radiotherapy is a frequent option,
*the therapeutic plan is then explained to the patient, with details of a personalised care plan.
