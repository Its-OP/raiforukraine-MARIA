'''<u>The three main etiologies of salivary gland pathologies</u>''' are:

- Sialitis: inflammatory diseases of the gland (sialadenitis) and/or the excretory canal (sialodochitis). The main feature is diffuse, painful involvement of the gland.

- tumours: localized benign or malignant proliferation of the gland. The main characteristic is a hard, localised swelling.

- sialosis: non-infectious diffuse pathology of the parenchyma. The main feature is a diffuse, painless, non-hard swelling of the gland (firm and elastic).

'''<u>SIALITY:</u>'''

*'''<u>sialadenitis</u>''''
Viral **sialadenitis (ourlial parotitis): bilateral,
**Bacterial parotitis: unilateral.

The most typical tables:

- Acute bacterial parotiditis in elderly, dehydrated patients: fever, diffuse unilateral swelling of a hot, painful parotid gland. This raises the auricle lobe (pinna). Pus in Stenon's canal.

- submandibulitis: infectious event evolving from Wharton's duct lithiasis: warm, painful swelling of the submandibular region with discharge of pus into Wharton's duct.

*<u>'''sialodochitis''</u> the most typical is lithiasic sialodochitis of Wharton's canal.

'''<u>TUMOR PATHOLOGY</u>''''

Localised, non-diffused swelling, usually non-inflammatory, rather hard and painless.

The swelling may be :

*Perfectly isolated: benign or malignant tumours in the early stages of their development,
*accompanied by adenopathy, facial paralysis, deep or superficial fixation: should suggest malignancy.


'''<u>SIALOSIS</u>''''

Chronic enlargement of several main salivary glands, without inflammatory signs.  

Consequence of global parenchymal infiltration secondary to a general pathology (sarcoidosis, Gougerot-SjogrÃ«n, HIV, etc.).

Involvement of each gland is diffuse, painless and not hard (firm, elastic consistency).
