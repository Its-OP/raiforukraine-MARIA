The treatment of cancer may involve several therapeutic modalities, in isolation, simultaneously or successively (''Figure 1''). The therapeutic decision can therefore only be based on multidisciplinary consultation. Oncology support care [[Know the definition of oncology support care 2C-295-DE-B01|oncology support care]] is not reserved for the purely palliative phase at the end of life, but is an integral part of the patient's therapeutic management from the moment of diagnosis.
