<Anti-tumour chemotherapy uses drugs that cause cell cycle arrest (cytostatic effect) and/or cell death (cytotoxic effect), mainly through apoptosis.

Chemotherapy is not possible without histological evidence. Only certain germ cell tumours can be treated without histological evidence on the basis of clinical, radiological and biological arguments.

====Three principles govern the use of systemic chemotherapy:====
- a constant fraction of tumour cells is killed with each therapeutic cycle. For example, if a therapeutic cycle kills 99% of cancer cells, a tumour mass of 1011 cells will be reduced to approximately 10 cells after 5 cycles;

- neoplastic cells are assumed to respond to treatment according to a linear relationship between dose and efficacy, which justifies the use of the highest possible doses, administered at the shortest possible intervals;

- The Goldie-Coldman hypothesis suggests that tumours have a spontaneous mutation rate of around one cell per 100,000 per gene. So a tumour containing 109 cells (about 1 gram) will spontaneously contain around 10,000 cells resistant to a given drug. But the simultaneous resistance of a cell to two drugs will only be observed in one cell out of 1010. This explains the superior efficacy of poly-chemotherapy.
