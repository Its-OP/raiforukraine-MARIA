<It is important to know the tolerance doses for each organ or tissue. Irradiating a tumour, which is usually deep and surrounded by healthy tissue, inevitably involves irradiating peri-tumoural tissue.

The irradiation plan must respect the tolerance doses for each healthy organ. It is possible to deliver high doses to part of an organ, and a much lower dose to the whole organ. For example, the spinal cord can tolerate 45 Gy, and the lung parenchyma 20 Gy over an entire lung.

The dose required to sterilise a tumour depends on the tumour in question (inherent radiosensitivity) and its volume.

Schematically, a seminoma of the testicle is destroyed by a dose of 30 Gy, Hodgkin's disease by 40 Gy, breast cancer by 50-60 Gy, and a very large ENT cancer by 70-80 Gy. A dose of >100 Gy would be required to destroy a glioblastoma.
