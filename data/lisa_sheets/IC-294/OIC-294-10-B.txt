<br />'''General measures''''

Application for long-term care (ALD 30). This document is drawn up by the general practitioner.

Placement of a central venous access in the case of parenteral treatment, unnecessary if oral treatment: usually an implantable chamber; or a PICC-line (central catheter with peripheral access).

Assessment of major vital functions :

- nutritional assessment with weight measurement, albumin and pre-albumin levels;

- cardiac assessment: ECG, cardiac ultrasound (particularly when using anthracyclines ++);

- blood ionogram, creatinine levels, liver function tests (transaminases, PAL, GGT and bilirubin);

- respiratory function test (RFT) in the event of treatment with bleomycin ;

- HCG in non-menopausal women ;

Fertility consultation, gamete conservation (CECOS) in a growing number of cases.

To determine the dose administered, it is necessary to calculate the body surface area (weight, height) and the creatinine clearance for certain molecules (carboplatin in particular).

====Main contraindications====
Polynuclear neutrophils < 1 G/L, platelets < 100 G/L, although this rule may be waived in emergency carcinological situations. It is sometimes possible to administer non-haematotoxic drugs in this situation (bleomycin, for example).

Infectious syndrome.

Activity Index ''('''''"''' ''Performance Status'' '''"''''')''' > 2

* in the absence of any acute complication

* except in situations where treatment is available with a high probability of anti-tumour response

1st trimester of pregnancy or breast-feeding.

Certain contraindications are directly linked to the drug used: for example, creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min for cisplatin.

Patient refusal to receive treatment<br />.
