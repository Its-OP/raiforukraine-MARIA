==== A severe complication: tumour lysis syndrome ====
Tumour lysis syndrome is the consequence of the massive destruction of tumour cells, leading to the release of intracellular compounds into the bloodstream. Tumour lysis syndrome occurs after the initiation of chemotherapy in fast-growing tumours, such as haemopathies, or in tumours with a large tumour volume, such as germ cell tumours.

Biological tumor lysis syndrome is defined by â‰¥ 2 biological manifestations:

- Hypocalcaemia

- Hyperkalaemia

- Hyperuricemia

- Hyperphosphatemia

Clinically, acute renal failure (almost constant), heart rhythm disorders, neurological disorders including convulsions, muscle cramps, nausea/vomiting and diarrhoea may occur.     

Prevention involves high levels of hydration with physiological serum to maintain satisfactory diuresis, and administration of rasburicase (Fasturtec) to prevent hyperuricaemia.
