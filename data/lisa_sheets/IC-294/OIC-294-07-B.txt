<Their severity varies according to the organ irradiated, but they are becoming less frequent as irradiation techniques improve (''Table 1''). The main factor to consider is the limited tolerance of healthy organs located in the volume to be irradiated: most healthy tissues are damaged for a dose lower than that required to sterilise the tumour.

==== A distinction is made between stochastic and deterministic effects, which are described in more detail below.====
'''''2.4.1 Stochastic side effects'''''

They are also called probabilistic: the probability of the effect occurring increases with the dose. The main ones are

- '''carcinogenic effects:''' the (very low) risk of secondary cancer after radiotherapy appears to be directly related to the extent of irradiation and the associated therapies (chemotherapy);

- '''genetic effects:''' they remain very theoretical in a radiotherapy context. The doses received by the gonads are often low, or even very low, because the volumes irradiated are at a distance. This genetic risk should only be taken into account when therapeutic irradiation delivers a dose of more than 0.5-1 Gy to the testicles or ovaries (lower than the doses that lead to castration).

'''''2.4.2 Deterministic side effects'''''

They all have one thing in common:

- appear from a "threshold dose" (which varies according to the organ or tissue);

- The higher the dose, the more severe the effects.

These are tissue effects, with immediate or delayed clinical effects.

A distinction must be made between ''early effects'' (transient and reversible) occurring during treatment and in the first 6 months thereafter and ''late effects'' (most often definitive) occurring after 6 months (Table 1).
