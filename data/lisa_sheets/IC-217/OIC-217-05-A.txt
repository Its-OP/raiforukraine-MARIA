<blockquote>''Majority of mononucleosis syndromes = primary infection with Epstein Barr virus (EBV).''</blockquote><br />

== '''Primary EBV infection''' ==
- 80% of mononucleosis syndromes

- Infectious agent responsible for infectious mononucleosis (IM).

- Primary EBV infection, usually asymptomatic.

=== Symptoms ===
- General signs: '''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]'''' high, persistent, '''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]];''''

- Angina or pharyngitis;

- Polyadenopathies '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]])''' ;

- Other signs: '''[[Splenomegaly SD-058|splenomegaly]]''' frequent; headache; maculo-papular rash (occurring most often after administration of ampicillin); '''[[Myalgias SD-077|myalgias]]'''; digestive disorders.
<br />

=== Possible biological abnormalities in primary EBV infection ===
- Mononucleosis syndrome ;

- Thrombocytopenia '''([[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]])''', haemolytic anaemia ;

- Frequent hepatic cytolysis '''([[Elevation of transaminases without cholestasis SD-206|elevation of transaminases without associated cholestasis]])'''.
<br />

=== Diagnosis of certainty ===
'''- MNI test''' Â± '''EBV serologies''' '''([[Interpretation of an SD-236 serology result|interpretation of a serology result]])'''.

- EBV PCR = no indication in immunocompetent patients in the absence of diagnostic difficulties.
<br />

== Cytomegalovirus (CMV) primary infection ==
- Primary CMV infection = 10% of mononucleosis syndromes.

- Mainly in children and young adults.

- Most often asymptomatic.

=== In case of symptoms ===
- General signs ''': [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia / fever]]''', '''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]]'''' ;

- Joint pain '''([[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]])'''', '''[[Myalgia SD-077|myalgia]]''' ;

- '''Splenomegaly'''

- Polyadenopathy''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|Single or multiple adenopathies]])'', hepatomegaly and angina are rare.
<br />

=== Possible biological abnormalities in cases of primary CMV infection ===
- Mononucleosis syndrome ;

- Hepatic cytolysis '''([[Elevation of transaminases without cholestasis SD-206|elevation of transaminases without associated cholestasis]])'''.
<br />

=== Diagnosis of certainty ===
'''- CMV serology''', with '''IgM''' '''positive''' '''([[Interpretation of a serology result SD-236|interpretation of a serology result]]).''''


== '''Toxoplasmosis''' ==


- Primary infection by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii

- Common and often asymptomatic.
<br />

=== Symptoms ===
- General signs '''([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]], [[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]])''' ;

- '''Polyadenopathy''' generalized '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]])''' ;
<br />

=== Diagnosis of certainty ===
'''- Toxoplasmosis serology''' '''([[Interpretation of a serology result SD-236|interpretation of a serology result]]):''' anti-toxoplasmosis IgM positivity, in the absence of IgG
<br />

== '''Primary HIV infection''' ==

=== In case of symptoms ===
- Primary infection is often "symptomatic": half of all patients present with symptoms:

- General signs: ''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]''', ''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]]''' ;

- '''Joint pain''' '''([[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]])''' and '''[[Myalgia SD-077|myalgia]]''' ;

- Generalized polyadenopathy '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]])''' ;

- Angina and/or ulcerations of the oral and genital mucosa;

- Maculo-papular rash '''([[Erythema SD-085|erythema]]]''' ;

- Neurological symptoms: lymphocytic meningitis, encephalitis, mononeuropathy;

- '''[[Splenomegaly SD-058|Splenomegaly]]'''.
<br />

=== Possible biological abnormalities in primary HIV infection ===
- Mononucleosis syndrome '''([[Prescription and analysis of blood smear SD-222|prescription and analysis of blood smear]])''' ;

- Thrombocytopenia '''([[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]])''' ;

- Hepatic cytolysis '''([[Elevation of transaminases without associated cholestasis SD-206|elevation of transaminases without associated cholestasis]])''' ;

- Other abnormalities: polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia ''([[SD-193 serum protein electrophoresis analysis|serum protein electrophoresis analysis]]),''' lymphocytic meningitis.
<br />

=== Diagnosis of certainty ===
- HIV PCR, associated with HIV serology with combined detection of the p24 antigen '''([[Interpretation of an SD-236 serology result|interpretation of a serology result]])''': the presence of HIV PCR and/or a positive p24 antigen with negative serology or less than 5 bands in the western blot defines primary infection.
