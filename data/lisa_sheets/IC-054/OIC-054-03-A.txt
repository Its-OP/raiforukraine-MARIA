'''Interrogatory'''

- age and the presence or absence of fever are the 2 key factors

- previous history (including sickle cell anaemia, prematurity, neurodevelopmental abnormalities)

- circumstances of onset: trauma (direct injury, entry point of a HAI, foreign body), post-infection

- Accompanying signs: fever, headache or neurological deficit (note stroke, rare in children), pain (note persistent sleepless pain and malignant tumour, see child cancer).

- functional impact: limited or impossible movement

- characterisation: time to onset, continuous or intermittent, changes over time


Clinical examination

- characterise the lameness: balancing lameness versus dodging lameness

- assess the impact: muscle mass (atrophy = old), antalgic vicious attitude

- complete examination of the lower limbs, particularly in small children, as there is a possibility of projected pain (painful knee in the case of hip pathology):

                      - search for "exquisite" pain points: palpation of the diaphyses and metaphyses

                      - examination of the joints: hip (abduction, internal rotation), knee (patellar shock, limitation of ampliation), ankles (limitation of ampliation)

                      - look for wounds (entry sites) and bruises

- examination of the spine: refusal to sit = beware of spondylodiscitis

- examination of the abdomen: watch out for appendicitis and psoitis with antalgic lameness

- examination of the integument to look for sentinel lesions (see maltreatment)

- do not forget the neurological examination: spasticity (prematurity), motor deficit (neurological cause)
