'''Imaging examination:''''

Prioritisation of additional examinations: X-ray of the pelvis from the front and of the painful hip from the side, if normal, ultrasound of the hip/knee +/- abdopelvic.  

- Standard X-ray, front and side, centred on the painful area (sometimes difficult to identify in infants): indirect signs of effusion, periosteal apposition or sequestration (inconstant and late in osteomyelitis, usually normal); X-rays are usually normal in cases of acute osteomyelitis. Standard X-rays are used mainly to rule out differential diagnoses (fracture, tumour).

- Ultrasound to look for joint effusion (of no etiological value) or subperiosteal abscess (uncommon in osteomyelitis), pelvic mass syndrome.

- MRI: focused on the painful area, to diagnose acute osteomyelitis (if X-ray and ultrasound are normal)

- Bone scintigraphy: diagnosis of osteomyelitis (if X-ray and ultrasound are normal), helps locate a bone lesion in young children.  Done as a priority if the MRI assessment requires sedation.


'''Biological examination'''

- in case of febrile lameness: CBC, CRP and especially blood culture

- in case of arthritis or abscess: puncture (+ joint lavage) under general anaesthetic ([Osteoarticular infections (OAI) in children and adults]])
