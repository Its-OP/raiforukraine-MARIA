*For all women: a clinical breast examination by a health professional is recommended every year from the age of 25.

*For women aged 50 to 74 with no risk factors''''': an organised breast cancer screening programme is based on systematically inviting these women to have a clinical breast examination and screening mammogram by an accredited radiologist every 2 years.  Mammograms are performed at two angles (axillary oblique and frontal), are reimbursed at 100% by the health insurance scheme and are double-read. Screening is legal in the absence of any clinical sign already identified (in which case the diagnosis is already being made).

*For women at high or very high risk: individual screening tailored to their level of risk based on a clinical examination combined with imaging (mammography, ultrasound, breast MRI) is offered.
