*Germline mutations in the tumour suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the 2 main causes of familial breast and ovarian cancer, classically known as hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC). The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.
*HBOC accounts for around 20% of familial breast cancers, but less than 5% of all breast cancers. When questioned, it is important to look for a family history of breast and ovarian cancer and, if necessary, to draw up a family tree.
*The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes code for proteins that play major roles in DNA repair and act as tumour suppressors. If these proteins are defective, DNA double-strand breaks are not repaired and contribute to carcinogenesis.
*A patient with a "BRCA1/2" mutation should undergo either specific annual surveillance, including breast MRI, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. Prophylactic bilateral adnexectomy is systematically recommended (between the ages of 40 and 45).

<br />

*Several cases of cancer in the same person or in the family may point to another genetic predisposition syndrome: "PALB2" mutation, Li Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene coding for the p53 protein).
