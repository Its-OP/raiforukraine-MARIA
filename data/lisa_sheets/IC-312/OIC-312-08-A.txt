* Mammography is the examination of choice for 1st-line screening, except in very young women (< 30 years of age).
* It can be carried out as part of screening or in the event of symptoms, for diagnostic purposes.
* Bilateral mammography and bilateral ultrasound of the breast and lymph nodes are performed systematically in the event of any abnormality on clinical examination of the breast.
* Mammography is used to determine the location, size and characteristics of the abnormality (opacities with blurred contours, which may give a stellate image with short spicules), and the possible existence of focal microcalcifications.
* Mammography can be used to guide biopsies or to locate non palpable lesions prior to excision.
