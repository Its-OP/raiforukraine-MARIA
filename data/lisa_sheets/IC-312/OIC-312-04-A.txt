* Breast cancer arises from the cells of the breast's secretory apparatus, consisting of the lobules and milk ducts.
* In the first stage, development is intra-epithelial, without crossing the basement membrane: these lesions are called "in situ" cancers (or carcinomas). In situ" cancers (ductal or lobular) are therefore characterised by their lack of metastatic potential.
* When the carcinoma becomes invasive (= crosses the basement membrane), the cells can spread either by lymphatic or haematogenous route or by contiguity.
* Lymphatic drainage of the breast takes place at three main sites: the lymph nodes of the axillary fossa (the most important), the supra- and sub-clavicular nodes and the nodes of the internal mammary chain. These different areas can therefore be affected by the disease.
