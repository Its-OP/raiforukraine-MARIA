==Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia== (in French)

*Decision on treatment based on LDL-cholesterol levels in relation to the patient's cardiovascular risk profile: [[Risk factor, aetiological factor, prognostic factor, health determinants, exposure factor 2C-020-DE-A04]].
*Statin treatment as first-line treatment.
*If target not achieved on statin, combine with ezetimibe or even cholestyramine.
*In severe forms, PCSK9 inhibitors may be used.

===In patients aged ≥ 40 years without diabetes, familial hypercholesterolaemia, renal insufficiency or known cardiovascular disease:===

*in cases of ''very high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''moderate'' or ''low'' cardiovascular risk, an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L'' (i.e. 1.00 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337). In cases of ''low cardiovascular risk'', the recommendations of the ''NSFA-SFD-SFE 2014'' set a value ''< 4.9 mmol/L'' (i.e. 1.90 g/L).

===In people with diabetes:===

*in cases of ''very high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''moderate'' ''or low'' cardiovascular risk, an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L'' (i.e. 1.00 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)

===In patients with renal failure:===

*in cases of ''very high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.55 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''high cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.70 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)
*in cases of ''moderate or low cardiovascular risk'', an ''LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L'' (i.e. 1.00 g/L) is recommended (European consensus ESC 2021: European Heart Journal 2021;42:3227-3337)

===In patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia:===

*LDL-cholesterol target < 3.5 mmol/L (i.e. 1.35 g/L) in children (often 4 mmol/L (i.e. 1.6 g/L) until puberty),
*''LDL-cholesterol target < 2.6 mmol/L'' (i.e. 1.00 g/L) in adults treated early without additional cardiovascular risk factors (some practitioners target 3.3 mmol/L (i.e. 1.3 g/L), the median concentration for the French population),
*LDL-cholesterol target < 1.8 mmol/L (i.e. 0.70 g/L) for adults treated late with additional cardiovascular risk factors,
*LDL-cholesterol target < 1.4 mmol/L'' (i.e. 0.55 g/L) in secondary prevention (limited level of evidence in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia).

==Treatment of hypertriglyceridemia=
Isolated hypertriglyceridaemia:

*Initially, dietary measures should be preferred.
*If triglycerides > 5.6 mmol/L (i.e. 5g/L): treatment with fibrates or fibrates + omega 3, if necessary.

==Treatment of mixed hyperlipidaemia=
Priority objective= normalisation of LDL-cholesterol (according to the rules above)

Once the LDL-cholesterol target has been reached, it may be suggested that fibrate treatment (preferably fenofibrate; never gemfibrozil) be added in high-risk cardiovascular patients with triglyceride levels ≥ 5.2 mmol/L (i.e. 2.0 g/L)= and low HDL-cholesterol.

==Surveillance==

===Effectiveness of treatment===
Lipid profile 2 to 3 months after initiation of treatment to check that lipid targets are being met, then annually.

===Clinical tolerance===
Search for myalgias

===Biological tolerance===
Measurement of transaminases, before and within 3 months of starting treatment,

CPK measurement only if myalgia
