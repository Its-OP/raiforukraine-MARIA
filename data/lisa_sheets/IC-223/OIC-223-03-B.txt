* Cholesterol, and more specifically LDL-cholesterol, is directly involved in the development of atherosclerotic plaque formed from macrophages that are progressively enriched in LDL-cholesterol, with oxidation and inflammation making a significant contribution.

* The link between LDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular risk is very strong. It has been clearly demonstrated that lowering LDL-cholesterol levels leads to a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular accidents.

* The link between hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis appears likely, particularly if associated with low HDL-cholesterol (in the context of metabolic syndrome). However, the level of evidence is not as high as for LDL-cholesterol.
