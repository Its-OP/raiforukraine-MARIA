==Cardiovascular risk assessment using multifactorial equations==
The European equations SCORE2 (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) and SCORE2-OP (older people)

*are based on serum non-HDL cholesterol concentration, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, age and sex,
*assess the 10-year risk of coronary ischaemia or stroke, fatal or non-fatal.
*are valid only in subjects aged ≥40 and <70 years for SCORE2 and subjects aged ≥70 years for SCORE2-OP.
*not used in cases of diabetes, chronic renal failure, familial hypercholesterolaemia or known atheromatous pathology.

If the SCORE2 or SCORE2-OP equations are not used, the level of risk may be assessed pragmatically by summing the traditional risk factors (SFE-SFD-NSFA consensus, 2016):

*Age (≥ 50 years in men, ≥ 60 years in women)
*Family history of ischaemic cardiovascular disease (≤ 55 years in father or first-degree relative, ≤ 60 years in mother or first-degree relative).
*Smoking (current or stopped less than 3 years ago), [[Male/female smoking 2C-075-PE-A02]]
*Arterial hypertension, [[Arterial hypertension SD-042]]
*HDLc ≤ 1.0 mmol/L [≤0.4 g/L ]

Risk level:

*low: 0 or 1 cardiovascular risk factor
*moderate: 2 cardiovascular risk factors
*high: ≥ 3 cardiovascular risk factors
*very high: history of cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention)

==Special situations==

*Patients with chronic renal failure in adults and children.
**Patients with type 2 or type 1 diabetes (SFD/SFC 2021 consensus: Diabetes Metab. 2021 Mar;47(2):101185)s,[[Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications]]
