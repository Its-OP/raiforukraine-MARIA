==Diagnosis==

*Diagnosis is made by means of a "Lipid Abnormality Investigation (LAI)" on serum after 12 hours' fasting. It includes :
**appearance of the serum
**quantification of total cholesterol,
**quantification of triglycerides,
**quantification of HDL cholesterol
**estimation of LDL-cholesterol by calculation if triglycerides<3.8 mmol/L (i.e. 3.4 g/L), otherwise by direct measurement.

==Primary hyperlipidemia and secondary hyperlipidemia=

*A distinction is made between ''primary hyperlipidaemia'', characterised by a primary abnormality of lipid metabolism (see below) with
**l''''pure hypercholesterolaemia: isolated increase in LDL cholesterol,
**l''''purehypertriglyceridaemia'': isolated (or highly preponderant) increase in triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridaemia is defined as fasting triglyceride levels > 1.7 mmol/L (i.e. 1.50 g/L),
**mixed hyperlipidaemia'': joint increase in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides,
*secondary hyperlipidaemia]''[https://sides.uness.fr/lisa/Conna%C3%AEtre_les_principales_causes_d%27hyperlipid%C3%A9mies_secondaires_2C-223-ET-A01 secondary hyperlipidaemia]'' and the specific dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The latter includes an increase in triglycerides and a drop in HDL-cholesterol, and is associated with a high cardiovascular risk.

==Different types of pure hypercholesterolaemia=

*Familial hypercholesterolaemia (classified as IIa in the Fredrickson classification)
**Severe forms secondary to single gene mutations (LDL receptor, apoB, PCSK9), causing early cardiovascular events.
**Rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia'', characterised by extremely high LDL-cholesterol levels >10 mmol/L (i.e. 4 g/L) and the occurrence of cardiovascular events in childhood.
**The much more common "heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia", characterised by very high LDL-cholesterol levels of between 5 and 10 mmol/L (i.e. 1.90 and 4 g/L) and the occurrence of early cardiovascular events (before the age of 50), in the absence of effective cholesterol-lowering treatment.
*Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia'' (classified as IIa in Fredrickson's classification): frequent, onset during life, favoured by a poor lifestyle, moderately high LDL-cholesterol level often < 5.7 mmol/L (i.e. 2.20 g/L).

==Different types of pure hypertriglyceridemia==

*Hyperchylomicronemia (or exogenous hypertriglyceridemia) (classified as I in Fredrickson's classification) divided into familial hyperchylomicronemia and multifactorial hyperchylomicronemia. They are at high risk of acute pancreatitis.
**Familial hyperchylomicronemias are rare and secondary to a genetic anomaly responsible for a deficiency in lipoprotein lipase activity (enzyme responsible for the breakdown of chylomicrons and VLDL).
**Multifactorial hyperchylomicronemia is much more frequent than familial hyperchylomicronemia and is of multigenic origin associated with exposure to environmental factors.
*Endogenous hypertriglyceridaemia (classified as IV in the Fredrickson classification), characterised by an excess of VLDL.
*Pure hypertriglyceridaemia'' marked by a high risk of acute pancreatitis, when triglyceride values exceed 11 mmol/L (i.e. 10 g/L).

==Different types of mixed hyperlipidaemia=

*'''Dysbetalipoproteinemia'' (classified III in the Fredrickson classification), rare, characterized by a harmonious elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides
*''Familial combined hyperlipidaemia'', fairly frequent, characterised by variability in lipid phenotypes (classically a joint increase in LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides [classified as IIb in Fredrickson's classification], sometimes an isolated increase in LDL-cholesterol [classified as IIa in Fredrickson's classification] or triglycerides [classified as IV in Fredrickson's classification]) within a family and in the same patient, and a high risk of cardiovascular events.
