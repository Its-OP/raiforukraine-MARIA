'''Chronic liver diseases''' are risk factors for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts, is a major risk factor for peri-hepatic and extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

However, unlike HCC, the majority of cholangiocarcinomas occur "de novo", i.e. without any identified risk factor.
