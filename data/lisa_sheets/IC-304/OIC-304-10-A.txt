With rare exceptions, '''tumours of the bile ducts are malignant''', mainly represented by '''cholangiocarcinoma'''.

The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma is made in the following circumstances:

- most often at an advanced stage in a symptomatic patient: jaundice, hepatomegaly, weight loss, right hypochondrium pain, fever;

- sometimes fortuitously during an assessment of biological anicteric cholestasis or during an abdominal X-ray examination.
