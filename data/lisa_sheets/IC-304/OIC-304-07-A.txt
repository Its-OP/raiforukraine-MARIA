'''HCC may be revealed by:'''

- a "complication of cirrhosis" (oedemato-ascitic decompensation, digestive haemorrhage due to rupture of oesophageal varices ....),

- a "clinical tumour syndrome" (tumour hepatomegaly, right hypochondrium pain, epigastric heaviness, jaundice, altered general condition, haemoperitoneum, etc.),

- fortuitously'' during an ''abdominal X-ray examination'',

- a ''screening test for patients with chronic liver disease'' (cirrhosis, advanced liver fibrosis, hepatitis B),



The clinical examination may be normal, or reveal clinical signs of cirrhosis and/or related to the tumour syndrome (tumour hepatomegaly, etc.).
