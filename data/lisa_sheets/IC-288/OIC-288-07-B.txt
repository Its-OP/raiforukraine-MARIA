The main diagnostic difficulty lies in the "haemorrhoid offence": sufferers and the practitioners concerned attribute any proctological complaint a priori to haemorrhoids, whereas these non-specific complaints may be related to suppuration, an anal fissure or cancer. This highlights the need for a detailed semiological approach and a good clinical examination.

In order to avoid being confused by a different symptomatology, the following summary table provides points of orientation in the event of acute pain.
