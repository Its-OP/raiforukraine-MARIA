Haemorrhoidal symptoms linked to the internal plexuses can be expressed in "two ways": either noisily over a short period of time (haemorrhoidal crisis), or because they are "long-lasting and are accentuated during and after defecation".

Haemorrhoidal crisis'' combines, to varying degrees, a sensation of cooking, tension or sharp pain in the anus, red defecatory bleeding (''anal epistaxis'') which can be spectacular but is not mixed with the material, and sensitive anal swelling (or a perception of internal tension). Symptoms occur rapidly and last for a few days. They are often accentuated by defecation.

When the signs become chronic, they often combine defecatory and post-defecatory anal burning that does not last long, more or less significant procidence of the anus that is more or less reducible after defecation, and bleeding. They may develop periodically. Anal pruritus is a complaint often attributed to haemorrhoids, but the causal relationship is tenuous. It should not be considered a haemorrhoidal symptom, particularly if it is chronic. Instrumental or surgical treatment of haemorrhoids should not be proposed in cases of chronic anal pruritus.

The classification of haemorrhoidal tissue into grades is classic:

- no procidence in the anoscopic lumen (Grade I)

- procidence in the lumen of the anoscopy but not outside (Grade II)

- procidence outside the anus during pushing but spontaneous reintegration at the end of pushing (Grade III)

- permanent procidence from the outset (Grade IV). In this situation, the internal haemorrhoids are visible outside the anus and anoscopy is often not necessary to visualise them. The important value of the clinical examination lies not only in describing the haemorrhoidal tissue but also in "looking for associated lesions": anal fissure in the radiating folds (often at the posterior pole of the anus, the anal fissure is an inspection diagnosis), anal abscess or fistula, condyloma, marisci, cancer of the anal canal or rectum.
