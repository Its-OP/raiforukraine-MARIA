Cf. [[2C-055-DE-A01]] - The absence of psychomotor acquisition at an upper age limit defined on the basis of the development of the average child must be considered as ''[[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115|anormal]].''''

An abnormality in psychomotor development may result from the '''' absence of one or more acquisitions at a given time (''delay'') or from a ''loss'' of these (''regression''). It may be isolated or global.

==Identifying abnormal situations (HAS 2020 reference)'''==

===Awareness of risk situations===

*1st degree sibling or parent with a neurodevelopmental disorder
*Prenatal exposure to a major neurodevelopmental toxicant (alcohol, certain anti-epileptics)
*Extreme prematurity (less than 32 weeks' amenorrhoea)
*Birth weight less than 1,500 g
*Acute neonatal encephalopathy (including convulsions)
*Cerebral anomalies with uncertain prognosis (ventriculomegaly, agenesis of corpus callosum, etc.)
*Microcephaly (PC < -2 DS, congenital or secondary)
*Congenital or neonatal infections (CMV, toxoplasmosis, rubella, meningitis/encephalitis, etc.)
*Genetic syndromes that can affect neurodevelopment
*Complex congenital heart disease that has been operated on
*Major surgery (brain, abdomen, thorax)
*Severe neonatal jaundice, including at term (bilirubin >400 μmol/l)

===Recognising unusual behaviour===

*Long-lasting, almost daily sleep disturbances
*unusual food selectivity for their age
*Difficulty taking food
*Aversion/avoidance of tactile contact, certain textures or fabrics
*Hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory stimuli
*strange exploration/use of "objects" and the environment
*Repetitive movements, gestural or bodily stereotypies
*Abnormally calm or passive behaviour; moves very little
*Exaggerated intolerance to changes in the environment
*Violent and repeated inconsolable anger
*uncontrollable motor hyperactivity (puts self in danger)

===Detect abnormal tests===
On the basis of a standardised psychomotor assessment, before the age of 3 :

*2 no's in 2 different areas
*or 1 "no" + 1 risk factor or 1 unusual behaviour

==How to proceed==

*Personal and family history: initial concerns, stages of development, progress, etc.
*Complete clinical examination including weight, height, CP
*Search for signs pointing to central involvement (around 70% of cases → neurodevelopmental disorders) or peripheral involvement (30% → neuromuscular diseases).
