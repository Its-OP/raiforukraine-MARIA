Neurodevelopmental disorders are multifactorial. The main risk factors are genetics, early environment and gene-environment interaction. A distinction is made between :

* Syndromic forms of NDT (around 15%), for which an aetiological factor has been identified (e.g. genetic abnormality or in utero environmental exposure to alcohol).
* NDT for which risk factors are probably involved, but with possible confounding factors for environmental factors: frequent genetic variations, prematurity/low birth weight, high parental age, foetal exposure to toxic substances/certain drugs, low socio-economic level, lack of stimulation.
