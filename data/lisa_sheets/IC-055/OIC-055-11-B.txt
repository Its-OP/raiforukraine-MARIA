The term "neurodevelopment" is reserved for the development of higher functions (intellectual, cognitive and behavioural development).

Children with motor disorders caused by damage to the central nervous system (cerebral palsy) or peripheral nervous system (myopathies) may also have neurodevelopmental disorders.

==Common features of neurodevelopmental disorders==

*'''''Developmental deficit ''''' in one or more areas: motor skills, language, memory, attention, executive functions, verbal reasoning, social interaction, learning, etc.
*'''Functional impact''' in different living environments
*Onset in childhood (but sometimes identified late)


The assessment of neurodevelopmental disorders requires a history, a "clinical examination" and "multidisciplinary" assessments using questionnaires and/or standardised tests.

Deviations of more than 1.5 standard deviations and scores <7<sup>th</sup> percentile indicate low performance, to be analysed according to context and clinical judgement.

Neurodevelopmental disorders are called ''specific'' when they are not better explained by another disorder (e.g. language delay in the context of a hearing impairment).

''Cf. [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): definition and semiology 2C-067-DE-A01|item 67]] for ADHD and ASD''

===Intellectual development disorders===

*Global deficits in mental capacity with functional repercussions.
*Severity defined according to the level of assistance:
**Mild: assistance with schooling and complex daily activities
**Moderate: assistance in several areas
**Severe: assistance with simple activities
**Profound: very limited communication, global assistance

===Communication disorders===

*speech disorders affecting articulation or fluency
*Language disorders (dysphasia) on the expressive, receptive (comprehension) or mixed sides. Several types depending on the predominant impairment: phonology, lexicon, syntax, pragmatics (communicative function of language), etc.
*Requires a speech and language therapy assessment

===Developmental coordination disorder-DCD===
''Formerly coordination acquisition disorder or dyspraxia''

*Difficulties in automating motor sequences
*In different areas - oral, fine motor, global coordination,
*manifested by slowness, clumsiness, feeding difficulties, difficulties with handwriting, etc.

===Tics===

*Sudden, rapid, recurrent movement that fluctuates over time
*Motor or vocal
*Transient or chronic
*Tourette's syndrome: multiple motor and vocal tics
