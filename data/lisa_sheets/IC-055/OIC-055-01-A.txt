Children's development is the result of interactions between their individual characteristics and their environment. Acquisitions'' in different areas such as language, motor skills, reasoning and socialisation are independent of formalised teaching (school), unlike ''learning'' (reading, writing, arithmetic).

==Main stages of normal motor development==

*gradual disappearance of axial hypotonia and limb hypertonia
*voluntary motor skills emerge
*muscle tone and control progress in the cephalo-caudal and proximo-distal directions
*archaic reflexes disappear before 6 months

==Main acquisitions of the infant up to 2 years of age===
The following table shows the main ''acquisitions of the infant up to 2 years'', taking into account the normal variability of development.
