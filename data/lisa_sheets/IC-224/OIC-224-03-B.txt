Various endogenous mechanisms are involved in the regulation of blood pressure:

- the baroreflex and the sympathetic system

- blood volume and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system

- natriuresis and the arginine-vasopressin system

Hypertension is essential in over 90% of adult cases, due to a defect in sodium excretion and stiffening of the arterial walls with age. Environmental factors linked to lifestyle can act as aggravating factors (salt consumption, excess weight, sedentary lifestyle, stress, etc.).
