=== Clinical measurement of blood pressure ===
Arterial hypertension (AH) is defined by elevated [[Arterial hypertension SD-042|blood pressure]] (BP) measurements in the consultation :

- systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg

- repeated several minutes apart in the same consultation

- persistent over time, over several consultations

High blood pressure is considered to be severe if the SAP > 180 mmHg and/or DBP > 110 mmHg.

=== Ambulatory blood pressure measurement ===
Blood pressure measurements taken outside the doctor's surgery using self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) or 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) confirm hypertension if :

- the mean of at least 18 AMT BP values ≥ 135/85 mmHg,

- mean daytime ABPM BP measurement ≥ 135/85 mmHg (daytime hypertension)

or mean nocturnal ABPM BP measurement ≥ 120/70 mmHg (nocturnal hypertension)

or the mean of 24-hour ABPM measurements ≥ 130/80 mmHg (24-hour hypertension).
