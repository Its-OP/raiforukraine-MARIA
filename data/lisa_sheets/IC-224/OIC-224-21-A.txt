Hypertension in children is defined :

- by a BP â‰¥ 95<sup>th</sup> percentile

- in relation to BP charts based on age, height and sex

- on several measurements over time, carried out under good conditions. If the reading is higher, it will be checked at the next consultation, together with "dietary hygiene" advice.

A calcium channel blocker (the sublingual form is contraindicated in children) may be prescribed as an emergency measure while waiting for a 2nd or 3rd specialist opinion.
