It is recommended that blood pressure be measured in children:

- before the age of 3, only if there are risk factors: history of low birth weight, renal, urological, cardiac or systemic pathology, etc.

- after the age of 3, once a year as a matter of course and in the event of warning signs (headaches, abdominal pain, polyuro-polydipsic syndrome, drop in height, etc.).

BP measurements are taken :

- in a calm child lying down

- with a blood pressure monitor validated for children (auscultatory technique), using a suitable cuff,

- on the right arm, because in the case of aortic coarctation, the pressure measured in the left brachial artery will be falsely lowered.
