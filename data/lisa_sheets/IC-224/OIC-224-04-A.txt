=== Clinical measurement ===
BP in adult consultations is measured :

- in a patient in a sitting or lying position who has been at rest for at least 5 minutes,

- with a validated blood pressure monitor, preferably electronic, using a brachial cuff adapted to the circumference of the arm,

- on at least 2 or 3 occasions, calculating the average of the measurements for each arm,

- for the first measurement, take a measurement in both arms, then take the other measurements in the arm with the highest blood pressure.

Repeat the measurements at least 2 or 3 times during each consultation, calculating the average of the measurements, ideally three measurements, and taking the average over the last two.

=== Ambulatory measurement ===
Two types of ambulatory BP measurement are currently validated:

==== Self-measurement of blood pressure (SMBP) ====
o performed by the patient themselves

o using an electronic device validated on the arm

o with 3 measurements in the morning before breakfast and before taking medication, and 3 measurements in the evening before going to bed, 3 days in a row ("rule of 3"), spacing the measurements a few minutes apart

o in a seated position, at rest, with the forearm resting on a table

==== ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) ====
o performed using an automatic BP measurement device and a brachial cuff adapted to the patient

o with systematic measurements over a 24-hour period, during the day and at night

=== High blood pressure profiles ===
These ambulatory BP measurements can be used to diagnose different blood pressure profiles:
