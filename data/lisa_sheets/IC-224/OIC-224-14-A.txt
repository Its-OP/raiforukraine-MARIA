==Therapeutic treatment strategy for hypertension===
The management strategy for hypertension is part of a comprehensive approach focused on each patient, depending in particular on his or her cardiovascular risk and preferences.

===''Initial care'''===
this involves :

====Lifestyle changes====

*regular physical activity adapted to the patient's abilities
*weight loss if overweight
*elimination or reduction of alcohol consumption
*reducing sodium intake
*smoking cessation
*a diet favouring fruit, vegetables and foods low in saturated fats

====Antihypertensive drugs====
Medication is started immediately in cases of moderate to severe hypertension, or in cases of mild persistent hypertension after 6 months of lifestyle modification.

It is therefore recommended to start with low-dose dual therapy in a single daily dose among

*[[Calcium channel antagonists|calcium channel blocker]]
*Diuretics/know the mechanisms of action, indications, side effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure 2C-330-PC-A02|thiazide diuretic]].

The treatment objective is to obtain a PAS <130 mmHg and a PAD < 80 mmHg in clinical measurements (PAS < 140 mmHg and a PAD < 80 mmHg in clinical measurements for the over 65s), confirmed by ambulatory measurements (AMT or daytime MAPA) < 130/80 mmHg (< 135/85 mmHg for the over 65s).

===''Follow-up and adaptation of care'''===

*if the blood pressure objective is achieved, continue with the initial treatment.

*if the blood pressure objective is not achieved, adjust treatment:
**review recommended lifestyle changes
**check adherence to medication, including therapeutic education, compliance and self-medication
**increase dosage of initial dual therapy or switch to triple therapy with ACE inhibitor or ARB2 + calcium channel blockers + thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide). Other active ingredients may be used depending on the situation: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure or pregnancy [[Beta-blockers/know the mechanisms of action, indications, side effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure 2C-330-PC-A03|beta-blockers]].

*if the blood pressure target is reached, continue treatment.

*if the blood pressure objective is not achieved, adjust treatment:
**review recommended lifestyle changes
**check adherence to medication measures (therapeutic education, compliance and self-medication)
**therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARB2 + calcium channel blockers + thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide) at maximum tolerated doses.

*if the blood pressure target is reached, continue treatment.

*if the blood pressure target is not reached, we talk of resistant hypertension

===''Resistant hypertension'''===
Management of resistant hypertension requires four anti-hypertensive therapies:

*ACEI or ARB2 + calcium antagonists + thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic (indapamide), at maximum tolerated doses,
