Management of secondary hypertension is provided by the general practitioner and another specialist of 2nd<sup>e</sup> or 3rd<sup>e</sup> recourse:

===Discontinuation of treatment that promotes hypertension or use of toxic substances===

===Apparatus for sleep apnoea syndrome===

===Treatment of endocrine or renovascular pathology===

====Primary hyperaldosteronism====
The treatment of primary hyperaldosteronism is based on blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor (spironolactone). Adrenalectomy may be performed when only one of the two adrenal glands is the cause of hypersecretion.

====Ph√©ochromocytomes====
The treatment of catecholamine-producing pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas is based on surgical excision.

====Renal artery stenosis====
The treatment of renal artery stenosis is based on optimising cardiovascular prevention. Renal artery angioplasty may be considered in young patients with fibromuscular dysplasia.

In patients with atheromatous stenosis, angioplasty is discussed in cases of resistant hypertension, flash PAO, deterioration in renal function on ACE inhibitors/ARB2, deterioration in renal function with no known aetiology, reduction in the size of the kidney, as well as LDL cholesterol targets of less than 1.4 mmol/L (<0.55 g/L) and prescription of an antiplatelet agent.
