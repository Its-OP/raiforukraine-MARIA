=== Follow-up schedule ===
Hypertensive patients should be monitored :

- every month for the first 6 months of treatment

- every 3 to 6 months after the first 6 months of treatment and once the blood pressure target has been reached

=== Monitoring points to watch out for ===
This individualised, patient-centred monitoring includes :

- BP measurements at the doctor's surgery, to be confirmed by ambulatory BP measurements (AMT or MAPA)

- monitoring patient compliance with antihypertensive treatment and lifestyle changes

- an assessment of the efficacy and safety of anti-hypertensive treatments

- reassessment of the risk of drug interactions

- looking for orthostatic hypotension

- adapting antihypertensive treatment to specific situations:

* reduce treatment in the event of persistent orthostatic hypotension, weight loss due to malnutrition or in certain frail patients
* temporary discontinuation of treatment in the event of marked hypovolaemia or an intercurrent event, particularly in the elderly (diarrhoea, dehydration, infection, etc.).

- screening for target organ damage

=== Additional examinations ===
The complementary examinations to be carried out are:

o a biological check of creatinine levels and a proteinuria test every 1 to 2 years, or more frequently in elderly, diabetic, renal or cardiac patients

o biological control of fasting glycaemia and investigation of lipid abnormalities every 3 years, in the absence of diabetes or dyslipidaemia

o an ECG every 3 to 5 years, or more frequently if there are cardiac symptoms or underlying heart disease
