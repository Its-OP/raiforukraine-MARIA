In patients aged 80 and over:

- the blood pressure target is even more individualised, with a recommended threshold of BP < 140/90 mmHg, to be adapted to the patient's tolerance, particularly in the absence of orthostatic hypotension

- dual therapy should be avoided from the outset

- Iatrogenicity is kept to a minimum, with no more than 3 active antihypertensive agents.
