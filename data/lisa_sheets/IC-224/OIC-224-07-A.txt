Inadequately controlled hypertension can lead to complications in :

- heart,

- vascular,

- brain,

- renal,

- ophthalmology.

The risk of complications linked to hypertension is determined by BP values, but also by :

- the presence of target organ damage,

- pre-existing cardiovascular disease or a concomitant pathology associated with a high cardiovascular risk (diabetes, chronic renal failure),

- assessment of overall cardiovascular risk.
