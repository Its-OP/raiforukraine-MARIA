The interview and clinical examination look for signs pointing to a cause of secondary hypertension:

- personal or family history of [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children|renal pathology]],

- consumption of toxic substances or use of pressive substances,

- look for hyperaldosteronism: history of 2C-231-DP-A14 dyskalaemia/hypokalaemia, episodes of muscle weakness or tetany,

- signs suggestive of [[Sleep disorders in children and adults|sleep apnoea]] syndrome, [[Pituitary adenoma|Cushing syndrome]], [[Pituitary adenoma|acromegaly]], pheochromocytoma (sweating, headaches, palpitations, caf√© au lait spots, etc.)

In this case, it is necessary to seek the opinion of a 2nd or 3rd line specialist. Further investigations should be adapted according to the aetiological orientation:

- nocturnal respiratory polygraphy

- Doppler ultrasound of the renal arteries

- abdominal angioscan

- 24-hour urinalysis: natriuresis, creatininuria and proteinuria, urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines, urinary free cortisol, aldosteronuria

- blood hormone assays: renin and aldosterone in standardised conditions, free plasma metanephrines and normetanephrines, minute braking test if hypercorticism is suspected.
