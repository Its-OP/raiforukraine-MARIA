*Mammography or ultrasound is necessary if there is any doubt about the diagnosis on clinical examination.
*Mammography or ultrasound can also be used to "rule out rare breast cancer" (< 1%) in men: eccentric, hard gynecomastia, attached to the deep layers and sometimes associated with nipple deformity or even bloody discharge ([Breast tumours|Breast tumours 312]]).
*In the case of simple gynecomastia, mammography shows a nodular or triangular, star-shaped opacity (Image), whereas no tissue is found in the case of adipomastia.
