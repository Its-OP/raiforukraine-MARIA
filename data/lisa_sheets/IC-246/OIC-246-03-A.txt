*[[File:Gynécomastie clinique.jpg|vignette|Gynécomastie clinique]]Differentiate gynecomastia from adipomastia without glandular proliferation. [Anomaly of the clinical breast examination SD-164]]
*The examination is performed in the supine position by squeezing the breast between the thumb and forefinger and bringing the fingers progressively closer together around the nipple. [Gynecomastia SD-041
*Palpation of firm mobile tissue around the nipple confirms gynecomastia. In the case of adipomastia, no tissue is palpated.
*In the case of gynaecomastia, the examination is completed by lymph node investigation and above all testicular palpation. [Bursal abnormality SD-108
*Concentric pressure and expression of the nipple should also be used to look for galactorrhoea, suggestive of prolactin pathology [[Nipple discharge SD-040]].
*Any doubt as to the diagnosis between gynaecomastia and adipomastia requires mammography. [Request for an imaging examination SD-231]]
