These tests are not very specific and are of limited value in early diagnosis (ECG and chest X-ray are often normal).

* '''ECG:''''
** rarely normal in severe chronic valvulopathy
** systolic LVH (RA) diastolic LVH (IM, IA)
** OG hypertrophy (MI, RA, IA, MR),
** atrial fibrillation (frequent, particularly in mitral valve disease),
** BAV'' (rare, especially in RA),
** right ventricular hypertrophy (RM)

* Chest X-ray:
** pulmonary overload (MI, RA, MR)
** cardiomegaly (IM, IA, MR),
** dilatation of the ascending aorta (RA, IA)

* Stress test:
** Contraindicated in symptomatic valve disease.
** Severe asymptomatic MI: not very well codified with study of VO<sub>2</sub> or stress ultrasound (regurgitant volume, pulmonary pressures on exertion in search of criteria that could prompt intervention)
** AR: value of a sub-maximal test in the case of a tight but asymptomatic AR</u> (search for: symptoms, ECG changes, unsuitable blood pressure profile, ventricular arrhythmia in favour of surgical management).
** IA: not indicated
** MR: stress ultrasound to measure pulmonary gradients and pressures if there is a discrepancy between clinical and ultrasound findings.
