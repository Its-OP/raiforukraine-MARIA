* '''Mitral insufficiency:'''
** Mitral plastic surgery as first-line treatment if feasible (prolapse+++)
** Mitral valve replacement by mechanical or biological prosthesis (> 65 years)

* Aortic stenosis :
** Aortic valve replacement with mechanical or biological prosthesis (> 65 years)

* Aortic insufficiency :
** Aortic valve replacement: mechanical, biological or homograft prosthesis '''(endocarditis)''''
** Ascending aortic replacement : Bentall procedure combining valve replacement and replacement of the ascending aorta in a valved tube with reimplantation of the coronary arteries (valvular and aortic damage) or Tirone David procedure allowing conservation of the native aortic valve (predominant aortic dilatation).

* Mitral narrowing:
** Open or closed heart surgical commissurotomy (post-rheumatic): rare
** Mitral valve replacement by mechanical or biological prosthesis.
