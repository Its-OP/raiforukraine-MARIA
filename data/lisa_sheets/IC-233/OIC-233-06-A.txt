*Transthoracic cardiac echocardiography (TTE) is the key test for assessing valvular heart disease. Trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is mainly used to assess mitral valve disease and in cases of suspected endocarditis.
*The purpose of echocardiography is to "confirm the diagnosis", assess the "severity" of the valve disease, determine its "aetiology", assess its "impact" and look for "other valve diseases".
*The main abnormalities are summarised in the table below:
