'''Mitral insufficiency''' :

* ''Organic or primary'':
** <u>Degenerative</u>:
*** Myxoid= Barlow's disease: young subject (<40 years), female predominance: valve prolapse due to excess tissue, rare cord rupture
*** Fibroelastic = age>60 years, predominantly male, more frequent cord rupture
** <u>Infectious endocarditis</u>: valve damage by perforation or vegetation
** <u>Post-rheumatic</u>: young subject, rare in industrialised countries, polyvalvulopathy often present
** <u>Ischaemic</u>: acute by pillar rupture or dysfunction (most commonly posterior)
** <u>Other</u>: trauma, drug-induced (anorectics), congenital, ...
* ''Functional or secondary'': by dilatation and hypokinesis of the LV (ischaemic or other heart diseases)

'''Aortic stenosis''' :

* Degenerative (Monckeberg's disease): linked to ageing, calcification and fibrosis of the aortic valve.
* Congenital bicuspidosis: young subjects (<65 years), often associated with pathology of the ascending aorta.
* Post-rheumatic'': young patients, rare in industrialised countries, often polyvalvular disease.

'''Aortic insufficiency''' :

* ''Chronic:''
** Dystrophic (annulo-ectasiante): >40 years, idiopathic (hypertension) or Marfan/Ehlers-Danlos/Turner.
** Congenital bicuspid: often associated with aortic pathology, particularly ascending (aneurysm).
** Post-rheumatic: <40 years, rare in industrialised countries, often polyvalvular disease
** Inflammatory: ''aortitis'' (lupus, syphilis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondylitis, etc.)
** Other '':'' '''Drug-induced''' (anorectics, chronic), '''Prosthesis''' (para/intra prosthesis), '''Post-endocarditis''''
* ''Acute'' :
** Aortic dissection / Valsalva aneurysm rupture
** Infective endocarditis
** Traumatic

'''Mitral narrowing''' :

* Post-rheumatic": most frequent = commissural fusion, secondary involvement of the sub-valvular apparatus.
* Degenerative: calcified annulus
* Congenital: rare (parachute valve)
