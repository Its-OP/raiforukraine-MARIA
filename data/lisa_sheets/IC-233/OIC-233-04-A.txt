'''Mitral insufficiency''' :

* Functional signs:
** Acute MI: '''acute dyspnoea''/OAP, snapping and brief '''chest pain''' for cord rupture (rare).
** Chronic MI: asymptomatic for a long time, then progressive dyspnoea.
* Auscultation:
** Soft, steam-jet murmur, holosystolic if severe, predominant at the mitral focus, radiating into the left axilla.
** Protodiastolic gallop in severe MI and B2 burst if associated pulmonary hypertension.
* Left heart failure or OAP (sometimes unilateral in case of cord rupture).

Aortic stenosis: asymptomatic for a long time

* Functional signs: symptoms on exertion (''dyspnoea+++, angina++,'' syncope or lipothymia)
* Auscultation: raspy, meso-systolic murmur, predominant in the aortic focus, radiating to the carotid arteries, abolition of B2 (in the case of a tight RA).
* Left heart failure: poor prognosis

Aortic insufficiency: asymptomatic for a long time

* Functional signs: Dyspnoea+++, exertional angina.
* ''Auscultation'': protodiastolic murmur, soft, aspirative, aortic focus radiating along the left edge of the sternum, better heard if the patient is seated. In severe AI: holodiastolic murmur, diastolic Flint roll, gallop, pistol-shot, etc.
* Peripheral signs: peripheral hyperpulsatility and increase in differential BP due to a fall in diastolic pressure (< 50 mmHg = severe AI).
* Left heart failure'' (late)

Mitral stenosis: asymptomatic for a long time, may be revealed by pregnancy or transition to AF

* Functional signs: dyspnoea, asthenia, palpitations.
* Auscultation: mitral focus diastolic rolling, B1 burst if valve is flexible, B2 splitting if PAH (Durozier 3-step rhythm)
* Left and right heart failure, AF, signs of pulmonary hypertension, haemoptysis.
