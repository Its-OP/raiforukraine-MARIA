*Mitral insufficiency:''''
**Percutaneous mitral repair= Mitraclip (This is a device used to percutaneously reproduce the surgical technique introduced by Alfieri, which consists of suturing the edges of the two leaflets of the mitral valve).

*Aortic stenosis:
**Aortic balloon valvuloplasty:
***rarely performed as restenosis is frequent,
***except in emergency (patient in shock or refractory IC),
***in the event of urgent non-cardiac surgery
***sometimes as a palliative measure
**Percutaneous aortic bioprosthesis implantation (TAVI, native valve left in place)

*Mitral narrowing:''''
**Percutaneous commissurotomy: rheumatic MR in case of favourable anatomy: valve with little calcification and flexibility, absent or minimal MI.

*''Under evaluation'' :
**Mitral narrowing or insufficiency: percutaneous implantation of a bioprosthesis in the mitral position (TMVI)
**Aortic insufficiency: TAVI
