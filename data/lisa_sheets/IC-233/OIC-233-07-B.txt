* Mitral insufficiency: The course depends on severity, aetiology, chronicity, LVEF, associated lesions:
** Acute: rapid progression to ''''OAP, cardiogenic shock and death in the absence of intervention.
** Chronic: ''left heart failure'', ''AF, endocarditis, thromboembolic complications''.

* ''Aortic stenosis:'' usually slow progression with reduction in aortic surface area of 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>/year on average
** Good prognosis in cases of asymptomatic narrow aortic stenosis (risk of sudden death < 1%/year).
** Poor prognosis from the onset of symptoms in the absence of intervention.
** Complications :
*** '''heart failure,'''
*** Conduction disorder
*** Rhythm disorders'' (AF),
*** '''sudden death''',
*** more rarely: '''infective endocarditis'', '''calcareous embolism'', '''anaemia (Heyde syndrome:''' coagulopathy induced by AR by acquired Willebrand syndrome leading to digestive bleeding by angiodysplasia'')'''

* Aortic insufficiency:''''
** Acute: very rapid progression to cardiogenic shock and death in the absence of intervention.
** Chronic: ''cardiac insufficiency, rhythm disorders,'' mortality 10-20%/year if symptoms, '''endocarditis, aortic dissection'' if associated aortic dilatation.

* Mitral narrowing:''''
** Prognostic factors: age, symptoms, fixed or unfixed PAH, feasibility of percutaneous commissurotomy.
** Complications: ''AF, heart failure, PAH'', ''thromboembolic'', cardiac decompensation in the event of pregnancy.
