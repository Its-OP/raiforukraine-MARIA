In the absence of contraindication and after assessment of co-morbidities and surgical risk.

* '''Mitral insufficiency:'''
** Acute poorly tolerated MI: emergency treatment
** Severe chronic MI (grade 3/4): assess +++ feasibility of mitral plasty, otherwise mitral valve replacement.
*** If patient symptomatic and LVEF > 30%.
*** ''If patient asymptomatic'': an operation is considered in the event of LV damage (telesystolic diameter > 45mm, LVEF <60%), in the event of ''AF'', if PAPs > 50 mmHg
* Aortic stenosis:
** symptomatic narrow aortic stenosis
** Tight aortic stenosis with positive stress test
** Asymptomatic narrow aortic stenosis AND (1 criterion) :
*** ''LV damage'' with LVEF <50% *** ''Very tight aortic stenosis
*** ''Very tight AR'' (Vmax>5.5 m/s), rapidly progressing (Vmax >0.3 m/s/year), significant LVH
* Aortic insufficiency:
** Acute severe aortic insufficiency: urgent indication (poorly tolerated)
** Chronic severe aortic insufficiency :
*** ''If the patient is symptomatic'' *** ''If the patient is asymptomatic
*** ''If the patient is asymptomatic'' , an operation is considered:
**** if LVEF < 50% or if telesystolic diameter > 50 mm / telediastolic diameter > 70 mm
**** in case of dilatation of the ascending aorta > 55 mm (Marfan > 45-50 mm according to the FDR of dissection, aortic bicuspidity > 50 mm)
* Mitral narrowing'': surgical intervention when percutaneous commissurotomy is not an option.
** Very severe MR
** symptomatic severe MR or other associated cardiac surgery required
** Moderate symptomatic MR with post-capillary PAH/mean gradient >15 mmHg on exertion
