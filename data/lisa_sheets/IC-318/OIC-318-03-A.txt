At the time of diagnosis, patients are ''mostly asymptomatic'' and the clinical examination is therefore normal.

In a minority of patients, the diagnosis may be made during a work-up for ''polyadenopathy and/or splenomegaly''. In CLL, superficial adenopathies are typically "firm, painless and non-compressive". They are ''symmetrical'' and often involve several lymph node areas (cervical, supra-clavicular, axillary and inguinal).

Finally, a complication, particularly an infectious one, may be the cause of the diagnosis.
