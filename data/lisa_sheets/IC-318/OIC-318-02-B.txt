Lymphoid leukaemia is a haemopathy and is therefore clonal. This clonality is easily demonstrated by immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes using flow cytometry, the reference test for diagnosing CLL.

Flow cytometry is used to analyse the expression of membrane or intracellular antigens by cells in suspension, using antibodies coupled to fluorochromes. The clonal nature of the abnormal B population can be demonstrated by analysing immunoglobulin light chains. The normal distribution of light chains is 2/3 kappa and 1/3 lambda. If all the cells in a B population have the same light chain, i.e. expression is monotypic, this indicates the monoclonal nature of the B lymphoid proliferation.

CLL lymphocytes express CD5, which is usually a T lymphocyte marker. The presence of this marker on the surface of the B lymphocyte population is suggestive.
