 Any ''persistent hyperlymphocytosis'' in adults, especially those aged over 60, should prompt immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes.

This hyperlymphocytosis is ''most often isolated'' but may sometimes be accompanied by signs of bone marrow failure such as anaemia or thrombocytopenia'''.

Rarely, a complication may be the cause of the diagnosis (autoimmune cytopenias, hypogammaglobulinaemia).
