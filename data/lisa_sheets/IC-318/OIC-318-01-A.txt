Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a ''monoclonal B lymphoid proliferation'' responsible for infiltration of the marrow, lymph nodes and blood by small mature lymphocytes.

This is the most common B lymphoproliferative syndrome.

The median age at diagnosis is 72. Therefore, any persistent "hyperlymphocytosis" (> 4 G/L) in an individual aged over 60 should raise the suspicion of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
