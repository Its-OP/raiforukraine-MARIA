The diagnosis of CLL is based on two tests:

- haemogram and blood smear

- immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes

In CLL, lymphocytes are typically ''unremarkable in appearance, monomorphic, small in size'', with ''mature, dense chromatin and a high nucleocytoplasmic ratio.''' The presence of ''Gumprecht lumps'' is highly suggestive of CLL and is secondary to the bursting of CLL lymphocytes during blood smear spreading.

Immunophenotyping of blood lymphocytes first confirms monoclonality. CLL cells express the CD5 antigen (usually found only on T lymphocytes) and CD23. These two parameters form part of the ''Matutes or RMH score'' (for ''Royal Marsden Hospital''), which analyses the expression of 5 antigens, each rated 1 point. A score of 4 or 5 confirms the diagnosis. A score of 0 to 2 rules out the diagnosis of CLL and points to another B lymphoproliferative syndrome. There are useful complementary markers for scores a 3.
