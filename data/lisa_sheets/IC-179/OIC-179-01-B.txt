'''<u>Amoebosis</u>''''

Amoebiasis is a protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is cosmopolitan, but predominates in areas with poor hygiene. It is transmitted by ingestion of water or food contaminated with cysts, which are highly resistant in the external environment. Once ingested, the cysts give rise to amoebosis infestation (vegetative forms) and/or amoebosis disease with intestinal +/- hepatic tropism, through invasion of tissues (by vegetative forms of "Entamoeba histolytica histolytica").

'''<u>Cryptosporidiosis</u>''''

Cryptosporidiosis is a protozoonosis, transmitted by faeco-oral or manuported transmission, which is also cosmopolitan. Clinical signs include acute choleriform or chronic diarrhoea, and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients.

'''<u>Giardiasis</u>''''

Giardiasis is a cosmopolitan protozoonosis with a strictly human reservoir. It is transmitted via faeco-oral route or during sexual relations between men. Transmission occurs through ingestion of cysts, which transform into vegetative forms in the intestinal lumen. Clinical symptoms are often asymptomatic, but chronic diarrhoea may be present in children, leading to malabsorption syndrome or malnutrition in low-resource countries.

'''<u>Toxoplasmosis</u>''''

Toxoplasmosis is a cosmopolitan zoonosis. The causative agent is a protozoan whose definitive host is the cat (the only host that excretes oocysts), with humans and other mammals as intermediate hosts. Humans ingest oocysts via food or water contaminated with cat faeces, and can also become infected by ingesting cysts present in the meat of other intermediate hosts infested with cysts. The clinical course of primary infection is symptomatic in only 20% of cases, and is aspecific (fever, polyadenopathy, odynophagia, etc.). Severity is linked to immunodepression (primary infection or reactivation) or in congenital forms.
