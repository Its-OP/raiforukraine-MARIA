The first steps to be taken to prepare for the investigation of a CFTI are described in the following table:
{| class="wikitable"
|'''CAT in the event of a suspected CFTI'''
|-
|Notify the doctor in charge/the hospital's operational hygiene team (if a healthcare establishment).
|-
|Identify patients who have (had) clinical signs
|-
|For each patient, draw up a list of symptoms, the date and time of their onset, and a list of meals eaten over the last three days.
|-
|Keep leftovers of raw materials and food served to the community over the last 3 days (keep refrigerated, not frozen).
|-
|Take stool samples and possibly vomit samples from patients.
|-
|Prepare a list of meal menus for the last three days
|-
|Report any suspected CFTI to the ARS medical inspector or, failing that, to the veterinary food hygiene service.
|}


An investigation is then carried out by the ARS's medical inspectors:

1) ''An epidemiological survey'', calculation of attack rates, distribution of cases as a function of time and space. Verification of hypotheses through investigation. For communities with less than 30 exposed people, a cohort study is carried out. For communities > 30, a case-control study.

2) '''A microbiological investigation''' :

Samples taken from the presumed source (communities must keep a control meal from the previous 3 days) for microbiological and toxicological analysis.

Sampling of pathological products from affected patients (stools, vomit, blood, etc.)

3) '''A health survey'''

Production, transport and storage of raw materials

Food preparation, transport, maintaining the cold chain

Sanitary condition of food preparation and storage premises

Control of catering staff
