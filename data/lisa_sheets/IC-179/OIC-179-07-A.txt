'''<u>Definition</u>''':

Appearance of at least 2 cases of a symptomatology, generally digestive, the cause of which can be traced back to the same food source.

'''<u>Symptomatology</u>''':

The majority of TIACs have digestive symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (choleriform or dysenteric), acute hepatitis.

There are a number of TIAC agents with neurological symptoms (sensory-motor disorders). (Table)
Toxoplasmosis may be the cause of CFTI but without digestive symptoms.
