Various forms of pollution affect water resources:

- Thermal pollution linked to various human activities poses a health risk through the microbiological proliferation it causes (free amoebae, legionella, algae, etc.).

- Radioactive pollution is the lowest apart from exceptional accidents

- Chemical pollution is probably the most common:

* Sodium from mining waste or seawater infiltration.
* Nitrates from agricultural activities, toxic if reduced to nitrites which bind to haemoglobin. Precursors of nitrosamines, they can be carcinogenic.
* Phosphates from agricultural activities and urban waste. They play a part in the eutrophication process, leading to the development of algae that produce toxins.
* Heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium), which are deposited in river and coastal sediments.  They can concentrate in aquatic flora and fauna, a source of poisoning for humans.
* Dangers associated with mineral salt imbalances due to natural contamination or disruption caused by man-made additions.
* Organic pollution linked to human activities, detergents, solvents, hydrocarbons, medicines, etc.

- Microbial and parasitic pollution :

* Fecal, human and animal origin linked to the absence or inadequate treatment of drinking water.

The most well-known and frequent are responsible for gastrointestinal disorders.

* Bacteria: salmonella, shigella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae
* Viruses: enterovirus, coxackie, echovirus, hepatitis A and E, coronavirus, rotavirus, norovirus, etc., causing gastroenteritis, hepatitis and neuromeningeal disorders.
* Parasites: Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Cryptosporidium spp.
* In certain uses of water, water microorganisms can become pathogenic: Legionella pneumophila, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium xenopi).
