'''Preventive measures outside the context of a TIAC''' :

The preventive measures consist of applying scrupulous hygiene rules throughout the food preparation chain (source of food, transport, preparation), with staff education and the principle of moving forward in collective kitchens.

Prevention also involves medical surveillance of staff and the exclusion of certain agents depending on the risk, as well as routine microbiological sampling in the catering sector.
