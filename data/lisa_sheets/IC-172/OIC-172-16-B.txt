'''Medical treatment''': combines tissue and contact amoebicides

* Tissue amoebicides: Nitro-imidazoles: metronidazole for 7 to 10 days.
* Contact amoebicides, non-absorbed to destroy endo-luminal forms (cysts, non-pathogenic vegetative forms) which cause relapses and spread to the surrounding area.

'''Evacuation puncture of a hepatic amebic abscess'''

* Only in the case of large abscesses that do not regress sufficiently under medical treatment.
