'''''<big>Epidemiological circumstances</big>'''''

History of a stay, even a very long one, in a hot, humid area, particularly a tropical one (including overseas departments): endogenous re-infestations ensure that the infection lasts for several decades. A patient can therefore remain infected for the rest of his or her life. Rare outbreaks of anguillulosis have been described in mainland France.

'''''<big>Clinical circumstances:</big>'''''

- <u>Often asymptomatic</u>, discovered during exploration of a fluctuating [[Hypereosinophilia SD-219|eosinophilia]].

- <u>When symptomatic</u>:

*Possibility of Löffler's syndrome during the invasion phase (more rarely than with ascariasis).
*Recurrent episodes of "epigastric abdominal pain" and/or diarrhoea during the state phase. A normal eosinophilia at this stage does not rule out infection.
*'''''Larva currens''''' '':'' pathognomonic skin involvement, reflecting the subcutaneous migration of larvae: pruritic creeping linear dermatitis of around ten centimetres, moving rapidly (several cm/hour) before disappearing spontaneously, which may recur at a more or less regular rate (endogenous cycle). These "larva currens" may take the form of urticaria.

- <u>Possibility of severe forms</u>, linked to '''hyperinfection (disseminated anguillulosis) following administration of [[Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SD-251|corticosteroids]]''', even at low doses, on an immunocompromised (organ transplants, oncohaematological conditions, HTLV-I retrovirosis) or debilitated (malnutrition, cachexia) terrain :

*Potentially fatal.
*Associated with deep-seated infections caused by Gram-negative or anaerobic bacilli, translocated by larvae that spread throughout the body (septicaemia, meningeal infections, pulmonary infections, etc.).

'''Anguillulosis should be investigated before starting corticosteroid therapy in any patient who has spent time in a tropical area. Systematic preventive treatment is recommended, even in the absence of a proven diagnosis.''
