'''''<big>Intestinal amoebosis</big>'''''

Parasitological examination of freshly passed stools (examination within 3 hours of passing stools, due to the fragility of the haematophagous forms of the parasite, ''Entamoeba histolytica'', which are the only forms that can be used to make a definitive diagnosis).

Non-haematophagous forms and cysts whose morphology alone does not distinguish between "E. histolytica" and non-pathogenic amoebae may be found, even in healthy carriers. Specific PCR techniques and antigen detection techniques offer diagnostic advantages.


'''''<big>Hepatic amoebosis</big>'''''

- paraclinical diagnosis of a hepatic abscess: hepatic ultrasound (hypo- or anechogenic image) and/or CT scan (hypodense image).

- Serological diagnosis: if negative, repeat after 7-10 days, but do not delay treatment if there is a strong clinical, epidemiological or radiological suspicion.

- puncture of the abscess: usually of little diagnostic value. Vegetative forms cannot be visualised, but detection of parasitic DNA is possible, easily confirming the diagnosis.
