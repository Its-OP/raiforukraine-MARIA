Intestinal infection by Entamoeba histolytica is often asymptomatic (healthy carriers). Clinical symptoms may appear months or even years after infection.


''<big><u>Acute intestinal amoebosis:</u></big>''

'''1.''' '''Typical form''': sudden onset of a typical dysenteric syndrome associating :

*afaecal diarrhoea (10 to 15 stools per day), with the presence of mucus and blood.
*abdominal pain in the form of pressure and tenesmus;
*no fever in general.
*the general condition is initially well preserved
*The disease progressively worsens, sometimes going into remission.

Clinical examination :

*Tender abdomen (++ iliac fossae), no hepatomegaly,
*Painful rectal examination.

'''2. Mild form'': the most frequent, with episodes of blood-streaked stools, which may go unnoticed.


''<u><big>Hepatic amoebosis</big></u>''

The main site of tissue amoebosis, a complication of untreated intestinal amoebosis. Hepatic manifestations may appear several months or years after contamination.

'''1.''' '''Progressive onset,''' in the immediate aftermath or at a distance from an episode of intestinal amoebosis, sometimes ignored,

'''2.''' '''Triad''' characteristic symptoms: '''[[Hepatomegaly SD-006|Hepatomegaly]] painful and febrile'''', with altered general condition:

*pain in the right hypochondrium radiating towards the shoulder
*early, constant, plateau fever of 39 to 40°C
*hepatomegaly, smooth, painful on shaking.

'''3. Possible pulmonary manifestations at the right base'''

All in all, a severe liver abscess (visible on imaging: ultrasound or CT scan), requiring "rapid management". The outcome is always unfavourable in the absence of treatment.
