The standard parasitological stool examination does not include a search for anguillula larvae (or ''Strongyloïdes stercoralis''). The prescription must therefore specify this request in the event of suspicion based on epidemiological or clinical criteria: "parasitological examination of stools with a search for anguillula" or parasitological examination of stools using the Baermann technique. This test must be repeated several times due to the discontinuous emission of larvae and the frequent pauci-infestation.

Anguillulosis serology, although lacking in specificity (cross-reactivity with other worms), can be a useful adjunct to diagnosis, particularly when stool examination cannot be repeated, or before starting immunosuppressive or steroid treatment.
