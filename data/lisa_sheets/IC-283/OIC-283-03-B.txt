Constipation in children is most often functional, requiring symptomatic treatment (hygienic and dietary measures, often combined with medication).

An organic cause should be considered in the presence of certain warning signs or in the event of a poor response to well-managed first-line treatment.

The functional origin is multi-factorial and develops after 6 months. Before 6 months, the mechanism is essentially reflex.

Repeated retention of stool in the rectal ampulla leads to constipation. This is terminal retention.

Other mechanisms may contribute to functional constipation:

- Lack of water or fibre intake

- Exclusive lacto-meal diet

The organic origin is explained by different mechanisms, depending on the cause:

- Absence of colonic contraction

- Ionic disorders

- Medicines

- Insufficient thrust

- Hypertonia of the sphincter

- Anal obstruction
