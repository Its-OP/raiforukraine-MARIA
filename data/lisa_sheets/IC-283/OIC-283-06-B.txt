A distinction must be made between idiopathic or primary constipation and secondary constipation.


A) ''Idiopathic constipation'': this can be linked to two mechanisms: a slowdown in colonic transit (transit constipation) and/or a problem with rectal evacuation (distal constipation or dyschesia).

If it's transit constipation, it's most often a reduction in the frequency and amplitude of colonic contractions. In this case, the patient most often describes a reduction in the number of weekly bowel movements, with rather dehydrated stools (small and hard because they remain in the colon for longer).

''If it's distal constipation also known as dyschesia'', it may be :

- a functional disorder (lack of anal sphincter relaxation or even paradoxical contraction of the external anal sphincter during thrusting, disturbance of rectal sensitivity) and/or

- an "anatomical" disorder with a disturbance of pelvic statics (rectocele, descending perineum, internal rectal procidence, etc.)

In the case of distal constipation, the patient most often describes exaggerated pushing efforts, a feeling of incomplete evacuation and sometimes recourse to digital manoeuvres to encourage evacuation (most often in the case of anatomical disorders).

NB: The two mechanisms of constipation can coexist.


B) ''Secondary constipation'': indicative of an organic disease, digestive or extra-digestive, which should be investigated during the interview.

Any recent or recently aggravated constipation should be investigated for an organic cause, primarily colonic stenosis. A medicinal or toxic cause should be systematically sought in patients complaining of recent constipation.


The possible causes of secondary constipation are presented in Table 1.


Warning signs :

- changes in general condition, weight loss

- nocturnal and insomniac pain

- rectal bleeding, melena

- severe, persistent constipation that does not respond to treatment or worsens without any obvious cause

- Rectal syndrome (epithelial discharge, tenesmus, false urination)

- abdominal or rectal mass

- biology: anaemia, inflammatory syndrome

|'''Digestive causes''''
|Extra digestive causes

| rowspan="4" |


- Luminal obstruction (colorectal or small bowel cancer)

- Non-tumour stenosis (diverticular, inflammatory, ischaemic)

- Anal stenosis (anal canal cancer, inflammatory stenosis, scarring)

- Extrinsic compression: benign or malignant tumour (e.g. ovary), peritoneal carcinosis, post-surgical adhesions, endometriosis, prolapse, etc.

'''Neurological:'''

- Parkinson's disease

- Multiple Sclerosis

- Spinal cord injury

- Ponytail syndrome

- Cerebrovascular accident


NB: It is estimated that almost 50% of patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases have transit disorders.
