The ''interrogation'' must include a history, specifying the mode of onset (sudden or gradual, early or delayed vomiting and cessation of bowel movements), the duration of the symptoms, recent changes in bowel movements, and the presence of any change in general condition or rectal bleeding. A history should be sought, particularly of abdominal surgery, neoplasia and radiotherapy, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease in particular) and vascular pathology.

General signs are normal in the absence of any signs of seriousness. However, there may be isolated moderate tachycardia (90-100 bpm) due to abdominal pain.

On inspection, we look for abdominal "meteorism" and abdominal scars from previous surgery (flange? ventration?). Percussion reveals tympany, and auscultation reveals a "change in hydroaerobic sounds", which may initially be increased, reflecting the struggle between abdominal peristalsis and the obstacle, and then decreased. Palpation generally reveals "provoked pain", but the presence of tenderness or even contracture are signs of seriousness.

Scars and hernial orifices (inguinal, crural (femoral) and umbilical) must be systematically palpated'', in search of an eventration or a strangulated hernia. The diagnosis of a strangulated hernia is clinical and constitutes an immediate surgical emergency without the need for preoperative imaging. Finally, the "rectal examination" is used to look for a tumour mass or faecal impaction.
