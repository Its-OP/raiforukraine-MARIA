Abdominopelvic ultrasound is the first-line examination in cases of suspected occlusion, particularly in the case of :

*Hypertrophic stenosis of the pylorus
*Acute intestinal invagination
*Small bowel volvulus due to malrotation

The unprepared abdominal x-ray is not indicated when the answer is provided by ultrasound or in cases of strangulated inguinal hernia, which is diagnosed purely clinically. It is useful for diagnosing neonatal obstructions. In all cases, it should be taken lying down, as it is more informative than a standing view, and enables the digestive distension, the cardinal sign of the obstruction, to be analysed more accurately.

An enema is sometimes indicated:

*As a referral examination in Hirschsprung's disease
*As a treatment for acute intestinal intussusception
