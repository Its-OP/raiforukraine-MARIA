The signs of clinical severity are initially general:

- A fever ≥ 38°C indicates digestive distress (from translocation to peritonitis) and requires urgent surgical management.

- Hypotension and tachycardia, or even hypovolaemic shock, developed on vomiting and the third sector, or septic shock on digestive perforation and peritonitis. In this context, the presence of "mottling" is also a sign of seriousness.

On examination, if the "pain changes from paroxysmal to continuous", intestinal ischaemia should be suspected, and if the "pain disappears without the occlusion being lifted", necrosis should be suspected.

On inspection, the existence of an "erythema" opposite a hernia or strangulated eventration leads to the suspicion of digestive distress (local inflammation).

On palpation, the presence of a ''tether'' and a fortiori a ''contracture'', also require urgent surgical management.
