- ''Functional renal failure'' due to extra-cellular dehydration associated with the third sector and vomiting. It may therefore be associated with an increase in haematocrit and protidemia, but also with ionic disorders linked to vomiting (hypokalaemia, hypochloraemia);

- Inflammatory syndrome'', indicative at least of bacterial translocation or even peritonitis;

- Metabolic acidosis, a sign of intestinal ischaemia.
