In children, intestinal obstruction has different aetiologies. Aetiologies are usually classified according to age of onset.

In newborns, there are congenital aetiologies:

* Intestinal atresia (including anorectal malformations)
* Hirschsprung's disease
* Meconium ileus (a form of cystic fibrosis)

In young children, the complication of congenital malformations and the first acquired pathologies :

* Small bowel volvulus due to malrotation (visible at any age)
* Strangulated inguinal hernia
* Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (characterised by non-bilious vomiting)
* Acute intestinal invagination

In older children, "adult" etiologies:

* Occlusion on flange
* Peritonitis
