This is a therapeutic emergency. Etiological treatment of intestinal obstruction is the priority.

For certain aetiologies, a therapeutic procedure will be attempted immediately:

* Reduction of a strangulated inguinal hernia
* Nursing of a patient with Hirschsprung's disease

Otherwise, general principles are applied before surgery:

* Fasting
* Intravenous rehydration (the younger the child, the greater the risk of dehydration)
* Nasogastric tube (or orogastric tube before the age of 6 months) suctioning
* Analgesics

Some operations are vital emergencies:

* Reduction of a hailstone volvulus and placing in a safe position

Other pathologies will be operated on after correction of hydroelectrolytic disorders:

* Extra-mucosal pylorotomy as a treatment for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis

Certain pathologies are only operated on after medical treatment has failed:

* Adhesiolysis for flange occlusion
