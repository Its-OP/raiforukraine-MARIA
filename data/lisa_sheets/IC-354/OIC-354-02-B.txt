The mode of onset of an occlusive syndrome may be gradual or abrupt, depending on its site and mechanism: it will be all the more abrupt if the mechanism is strangulation (strangulated hernia/ventricle, volvulus, flange). Similarly, the risk of intestinal ischaemia and necrosis is greater and earlier in cases of strangulation. The various mechanisms are summarised in Figure 1 and Table 1; the complications are summarised in Figure 2.
