'''Varicella:''' few indications, as immunisation is often given in childhood.

If no immunisation (negative serology): live attenuated virus vaccine, indicated for adolescents and women of childbearing age (not pregnant, on effective contraception 1 month after injection); healthcare professionals; professionals in contact with infants; adults exposed to 1 case of chickenpox < 72 hours.

'''Zona:''' objective of the vaccine: to prevent reactivation in elderly patients. Same vaccine as chickenpox, but higher dose. Recommended since 2014 by the HCSP for 65-74 year olds, 1 injection, but modest efficacy (50% reduction in the incidence of shingles in the 3 years following vaccination and less efficacy after the age of 70).

To prevent postherpetic pain, 364 people need to be vaccinated to prevent an additional case of neuralgia.
