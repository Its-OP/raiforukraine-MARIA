Fever and general malaise; inconstant maculopapular eruption at the beginning then very pruritic disseminated vesicular eruption, erosion and appearance of crust at D4 healing at D10, evolution by attacks (lesions of different ages): scalp, face, thorax, respect of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, +/- oral enanthema with erosion.

Most often benign: spontaneous favourable evolution in 10 to 15 days.

Complications: bacterial skin superinfection due to scratching, encouraged by NSAIDs and the absence of local care.

Rare deaths of non-immunocompromised children due to septic shock following bacterial superinfection, usually before the age of 1.

Severe forms in special circumstances (pregnancy, neonates, immunodepression): interstitial pneumonia, profuse necrotic and haemorrhagic rash, thrombocytopenic purpura, convulsion, cerebellar ataxia (rare 1/4000, self-limiting).
