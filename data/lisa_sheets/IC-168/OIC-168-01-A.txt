HSV1 and HSV2: contamination occurs through direct mucocutaneous contact, with saliva and skin lesions playing a role: kissing, vaginal birth, sexual intercourse; breast-feeding (very rare); possible transplacental transmission.

VZV: transmission is most often by air, more rarely by contact. Highly contagious. From 2 days before the rash to 7 days afterwards. Contamination ends when the rash begins.
