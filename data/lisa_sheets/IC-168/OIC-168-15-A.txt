'''HSV:''' according to the clinic

- Acute gingivostomatitis: spontaneous favourable evolution in 15 days, ensure good hydration,

systemic treatment may be given if the picture is marked (valaciclovir, see intravenous treatment with aciclovir if oral rehydration is not possible)

- Herpetic keratitis: specialist ophthalmological opinion,

topical acyclovir (ointment) +/- systemic in severe cases, absolute contraindication to topical corticoids

- Genital herpes: oral antiviral treatment (valaciclovir), does not prevent recurrence

Long-term preventive treatment to be discussed if more than 6 annual recurrences of genital or orofacial herpes (suspensive only, risk of recurrence when stopped).

Varicella'': local symptomatic treatment to combat the risk of skin superinfection (disinfection with soap and water, short nails), +/- antihistamines, aspirin and NSAIDs contraindicated (risk of Reye's syndrome).

'''Shingles:''' local symptomatic treatment, pain management.

No antibiotic treatment is required unless there is a proven skin infection.

Early antiviral treatment (72 hours) with valaciclovir or famciclovir may be used to prevent post-herpes zoster pain (age > 50 years, extensive shingles, intense pain in the acute phase) or to prevent ocular damage in ophthalmic shingles.
