Specialist management with ophthalmological examination.

Topical treatment with aciclovir ointment 5 times a day for 5 to 10 days +- intravenous treatment if deep keratitis, uveitis or retinal necrosis.

Absolute contraindication to corticosteroid therapy, which can even lead to corneal perforation, and local anaesthetics (risk of masking a deteriorating course).
