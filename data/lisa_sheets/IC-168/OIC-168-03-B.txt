Herpes viruses are DNA-enveloped viruses, of which there are more than 80, 8 of which are pathogenic for humans.

Viruses HSV-1 and -2 (herpes simplex virus 1 and 2), CMV (cytomegalovirus), EBV (Epstein Barr virus), VZV (varicella zoster virus), human herpes virus (HHV-6,-7,-8).

Infection is controlled by cell-mediated immunity: serious infections when this immunity is deficient (AIDS, transplant patients or immunosuppressive treatment).
