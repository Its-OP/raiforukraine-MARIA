'''HSV1 :'''

- Primary infection in early childhood, usually asymptomatic. Sometimes acute gingivostomatitis: diffuse ulcerations in the mouth and/or lips and/or chin, febrile at 39Â°C, locoregional adenopathies, +- accompanied by major dysphagia.

- Recurrences of herpes labialis or cheilitis, or "cold sores": a one-sided cluster of vesicles at the mucocutaneous junction in the oral cavity.

- Occasionally eye involvement, usually recurrent, with keratitis: painful red eye with photophobia and tearing, with pre-tracheal adenopathy, typical lesions visible with fluorescein (dendritic keratitis = serrated fern leaf on the cornea).

'''HSV2''' :

- Genital primary infection: incubation period 2-7 days, 1/3 symptomatic; painful, erythemato-vesicular lesions rapidly ulcerated and covered with a whitish exudate. Rarely fever, malaise, bilateral inguinal adenopathy. Healing sometimes takes several weeks.

- Recurrences: 2 phases (prodromal with pain, pruritus, tingling for a few hours, then lesion-like with the appearance of blister-like lesions, often localised in the same place as the primary infection). Healing takes between 7 and 10 days''''.''''
