When faced with acute low back pain, it is important to rule out other possible causes before accepting the diagnosis of common acute low back pain (spinal and mechanical origin of the pain). We will distinguish between acute low back pain of common and mechanical origin and acute low back pain of secondary origin.

The interview states:

antecedents (neoplastic, infectious, etc.); circumstances of onset (after exertion, lifting, etc.); main site of pain (low back pain, right or left lumbar fossa, etc.) and intensity; pain radiations (iliac fossa, hypogastric region, inguinal fold, etc.); rhythm of pain: mechanical or inflammatory; course of pain (progressive worsening, resistant to medical treatment, etc.); history of low back pain: previous similar episodes, evolution of the pain, etc.).); the rhythm of the pain: mechanical or inflammatory; the course of the pain (progressive worsening, resistant to medical treatment, etc.); the history of low back pain: previous similar episodes with a favourable outcome may be reassuring; the absence of general signs (fever, adenopathy, etc.) or associated signs (nausea/vomiting, micturition problems, paresthesias, etc.).

The clinical examination looks for :

If possible, the patient should be standing up, examined in profile and from the back; look for a disorder of spinal statics, an analgesic attitude in relation to the lumbago; look for painful points on palpation of the spine, often with stiffness in the lumbago; look for a cellulo-myalgic syndrome opposite the painful areas; look for sacroiliac, hip and gluteal pain as part of the differential diagnosis.

A neurological examination will rule out radiculalgia or cauda equina. A general and visceral examination will be carried out depending on the associated signs and the context.
