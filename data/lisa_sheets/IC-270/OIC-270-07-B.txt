The prognosis is favourable, after the first few days in the case of acute low back pain (or lumbago), but can last several weeks or months in sub-acute or chronic forms.

The biopsychosocial context can influence the transition to chronicity (yellow flags):

* depression ;
* emotional distress
* anxiety
* fear of pain and trauma;
* catastrophism
* false beliefs about evolution
* false information;
* family conflict.

Occupational factors are also associated with this chronicity (black flags):

* prolonged work stoppages, search for secondary benefits;
* professional conflict
* dissatisfaction at work
* conflicts and disputes with insurance companies, social security, experts, etc;
* over-caring (family, doctors);
* difficult working conditions with no opportunity for change;
* type of professional activity.
