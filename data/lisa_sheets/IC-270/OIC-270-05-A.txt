Here are the general rules:

* at the end of the clinical examination, no further examination should be systematically requested if there is no specific clinical indication justifying it;
* in the case of simple lumbago or a recurrence of known low back pain that has already been investigated, there is no need to carry out imaging ;
* if the pain is resistant to symptomatic treatment or is worsening, or if there are signs of severity (fever, neurological deficit, etc.), imaging tests should be performed.), imaging tests should be ordered as a matter of urgency: (1) in the case of a secondary cause of spinal or neurological origin, the key test is MRI, which should be performed after standard X-rays; (2) in the case of a secondary cause of visceral origin, the key test is a thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan or, failing that, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound.

For urological and renal causes, the additional imaging examinations are: reference abdominal-renal scanner, non-injected and then possibly injected if there is any doubt about the diagnosis or if there is no obstacle, or ASP/ultrasound if the scanner is not available and there are no criteria or signs of seriousness or complication. No additional imaging is required for cord torsion.
