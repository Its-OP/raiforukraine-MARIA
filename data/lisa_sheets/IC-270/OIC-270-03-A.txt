== The signs of acute low back pain are: ==

* sepsis, septic shock [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]]
* oligo-anuria, acute renal failure
* acute anaemia, arterial hypotension, haemorrhagic shock [[State of shock. Main aetiologies: hypovolaemic, septic (see item 158), cardiogenic, anaphylactic|332]]
* heart rhythm disorder [[Atrial fibrillation|232]]
* abdominal defence or contracture, intestinal obstruction
* severe dyspnoea, respiratory distress [[Acute respiratory distress and failure in infants, children and adults|359]]

* motor deficit
* abnormal neurological examination

== For a urological cause, you need: ==

*Identify complicated renal colic:
**[[2C-161|Febrile nephritic colic 161]] and [[2C-265|265]] (obstructive pyelonephritis): hyperthermia, clinical signs of sepsis.
**2C-265|Hyperalgesic nephritic colitis 265]: pain resistant to well-administered IV analgesic treatment combining NSAIDs and morphine analgesics, level 3 in titration.
**anuric nephritic colic: oligo-anuria, acute renal failure
**Hyperalgesic nephritic colic resistant to well-administered medical treatment (fluid restriction, NSAIDs, morphine).

*Identify [[2C-161|acute pyelonephritis 161]] that is complicated or at risk of complication.
*Identify a [[2C-050|torsion of the spermatic cord 50]]
