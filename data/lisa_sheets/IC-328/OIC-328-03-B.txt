The financing of a medical device can often not be separated from the associated procedure. Depending on whether the device is used in the community or in hospital, 2 main types of reimbursement are possible:

- In hospitals, the financing of medical devices, whether for individual use or linked to a procedure, is covered by the hospital stay charge (GHS). It is only if the medical device is included on the so-called 'extra' list that its financing will be covered by the LPPR.

- In towns and cities, DM is financed directly by the procedure or by the LPPR tariff in the case of individual use.
