                        Linked to "Staphylococcus aureus", producer of exfoliating toxins (leading to lysis of desmosomes).

                      This entity mainly affects (very) young children and immunocompromised adults. It is

                      clinically characterised by a patchy exanthema that is often quite diffuse, starting and predominating

                      in the large folds and periorificial areas, particularly the umbilicus, associated with the infected site

                      The original S aureus infection may not be clinically evident. The erythema rapidly evolves into

                      bullous detachments in very superficial flaps without mucosal involvement.

                      The diagnosis is confirmed by bacteriological samples taken from the initial infection site.
