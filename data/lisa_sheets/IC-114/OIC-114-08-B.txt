Kawasaki syndrome is an acute cutaneous-systemic vasculitis mainly affecting

children under the age of 5 but also, more rarely, adults, and is characterised by the association of

at least 5 of the following 6 clinical signs:

- high fever > 38.5Â°C plateauing for more than 5 days

- bilateral conjunctivitis with eyelid oedema

- cheilitis and an edematous tongue with a "raspberry" appearance

- oedematous erythema of the extremities, often progressing to "glove finger" desquamation

- exanthema, often morbilliform and/or in large sheets (polymorphous), which may extend to the perineum

- adenopathy, particularly cervical adenopathy, often asymmetric

This is a genuine diagnostic and therapeutic emergency because of the risk of coronary aneurysms.
