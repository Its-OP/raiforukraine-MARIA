An exanthema is an acute, transient skin rash.

Erythematous exanthemas are characterised by a more or less intense red colouration of the skin due to vascular vasodilatation, which disappears on in vitro pressure. It must be distinguished from purpura (= cutaneous microhaemorrhages) which does not fade on in vitropressure (see sheet 114).

Exanthemata may be accompanied by mucosal involvement (enanthema).
