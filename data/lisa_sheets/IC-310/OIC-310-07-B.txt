==D'Amico classification==

*In the majority of cases, prostate cancer is localised/locally advanced, i.e. confined to the prostate and not metastatic.
*The treatment strategy at this stage is curative according to the D'Amico classification of risk groups (see indications at the end of this objective).
*
<u>To remember about the D'Amico classification</u>:

-prognostic classification

for localized or locally advanced but non-metastatic prostate cancer

-based on 3 criteria: digital rectal examination, PSA level and ISUP group

-3 risk groups (progression, recurrence)

* low risk
* intermediate risk
* high risk

D'Amico's prognostic group depends on: extension work-up, treatment

'''D'Amico classification''''
{| class="wikitable"
|Low risk
|PSA â‰¤ 10 ng/ml, and ISUP score 1, and clinical stage T1c or T2a
|-
|Intermediate risk
|PSA between 10 and 20 ng/ml, or ISUP score 2 or 3, or clinical stage T2b
|-
|High risk
|PSA > 20 ng/ml, or ISUP score > 3, or clinical stage T2c
|}
TIc: normal rectal examination

T2a: abnormality of less than half a prostate lobe on digital rectal examination

T2b: abnormality of more than half of a single prostate lobe on rectal examination

T2c: abnormality of the 2 prostatic lobes on rectal examination

==Abstention-surveillance===

*For frail patients with serious co-morbidities and limited life expectancy, abstention and monitoring is indicated.
*Patients are treated symptomatically when clinical signs related to cancer appear (pain).<br /> Patients are treated symptomatically when clinical signs related to cancer appear (pain).<br /> Patients are treated symptomatically when clinical signs related to cancer appear (pain).

==Active surveillance==

*For low-risk cancers, it allows the complications of more invasive treatments (urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, digestive transit disorders, etc.) to be avoided without loss of chance.
*Active surveillance involves performing PSA, TR, pelvic and prostate MRI and iterative biopsies to ensure that the disease is not progressing.
*Invasive curative treatment is indicated if the cancer progresses.
*Theoretical low risk of allowing aggressive cancer to progress.

==Total prostatectomy==

*This is a curative surgical treatment.
*It involves total removal of the prostate and seminal vesicles.
*It is performed all at once, without neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.
*Can be part of a multimodal treatment combining radiotherapy and hormone therapy for the most aggressive cancers.
*Exposes the patient to the risk of immediate surgical complications: haemorrhage, lymphocele if lymph node dissection, rectal wound, urinary fistula, thrombo-embolism, infection, etc.
*Exposes the patient to the risk of long-term functional complications.
**Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
**Urinary incontinence (common after surgery but recovers in most cases)
**Constant infertility and anejaculation
**Stenosis of the urethrovesical anastomosis (rare)

==External radiotherapy==

* Irradiation of the prostate cavity for curative purposes and of the pelvic lymph nodes for high-risk cancers.
* May be combined with temporary adjuvant hormone therapy (potentiation) see [[Cancer treatment: main modalities, therapeutic classes and their major complications. The multidisciplinary therapeutic decision and patient information]] (2C-294 03-A, 2C-294-12-A and 2C-294-16-B)
* Treatment method very different from surgery with daily radiotherapy for 4-6 weeks.
* Exposes the patient to the risk of increased lower urinary tract symptoms, haematuria and rectal bleeding during treatment.
*Exposes the patient to the risk of distant functional and post-radiation complications:
**Stenosis of the urethra
**Radiation-induced cystitis/rectitis
**Erectile dysfunction (most frequent complication)
**Secondary cancer
**Urination problems
**Digestive transit disorders

==Interstitial brachytherapy==

*Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds into the prostate via the perineal route. Unlike external radiotherapy, it can be performed in a single session.
*Treatment with the lowest risk of causing erectile dysfunction.
*Side effects are identical to those of radiotherapy.

==Focused ultrasound (HIFU)

*Allows prostate tissue to be destroyed by ultrasound.
*Low morbidity.
*Treatment of the prostate can be partial or total, with the possibility of a second session if necessary.
*The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic in a single session.
*Endoureteral resection is often associated with the procedure to reduce the risk of acute urine retention and severe dysuria.
*Is a first-line treatment currently being evaluated.

==Dynamic phototherapy==

*Treatment under evaluation, not feasible outside clinical trials.



'''<u>The indications according to D'Amico's group (CC-AFU 2022-2024)</u>''''

Patients must be informed of: treatment modalities and complications, benefits/risks of treatment

All files must be presented to the oncology RCP.

<u>-localised low risk</u>.

Active surveillance is the recommended treatment

The options are: total prostatectomy, radiotherapy, brachytherapy, etc.

In clinical trials only: cryotherapy, HIFU

Hormonal treatment alone: not recommended

<u>-localised intermediate risk</u>.

Total prostatectomy +/- curage

Radiotherapy +/- hormone therapy 6 months

Brachytherapy

Active surveillance: in selected cases

Cryotherapy and HIFU: clinical trials only

Hormonal treatment alone: not recommended

<u>-localised high-risk</u>

Long-term hormone therapy (18-36 months) with pelvic radiotherapy

Total prostatectomy with curage

Cryotherapy and HIFU: not recommended
