==The known risk factors are:==

*Age: the incidence of cancer increases with age (rare before the age of 50).
*Genetic factors: a hereditary form is suspected when there are cases in 1st or 2nd degree relatives (2 cases diagnosed before the age of 55 or 3 cases whatever the age). The inheritance may also be monogenic (approximately 5% of cases). A history of breast or ovarian cancer should also be sought to justify a possible oncogenetic consultation (BRCA mutation).
*Ethnic origin, particularly African ancestry, increases the risk of prostate cancer. Conversely, prostate cancer is less common in the Asian population.
*Environmental factors, such as pesticides and endocrine disruptors (e.g. chlordecone pollution in the West Indies is recognised as a possible risk factor for prostate cancer; occupational exposure to chlordecone was recognised as an occupational disease in 2021).
*Metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (AFU 2022-2024 Cancer Committee recommendations).
