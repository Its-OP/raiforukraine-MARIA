==Localized prostate cancer:==

*Typically asymptomatic.
*Normal DTR or finding of a nodule or induration.
*Diagnosed on prostate biopsies taken for elevated PSA.
*Urinary symptoms may be associated, generally with a concomitant prostate adenoma. These should be investigated as they may influence treatment.
*Does not cause sexual problems
*Does not generally lead to haemospermia

==Locally advanced prostate cancer:==

*Diagnosed by digital rectal examination or by an increase in PSA.
*Micturition problems related to urethral obstruction by cancer
*Beware of the risk of URO due to urethral obstruction and acute obstructive renal failure (due to URO or ureteral obstruction due to invasion of the trigone).

==Metastatic prostate cancer:==

*Impaired general condition, asthenia, anaemia due to bone marrow invasion
*Bone pain that may indicate bone metastases
*Non-traumatic spinal cord compression and cauda equina syndrome|Neurological signs due to compression 93 (paresthesia or even paraplegia of the lower limbs, cauda equina syndrome) related to spinal cord compression on spinal metastases.
*Localised or generalised oedema of the lower limbs|Å’dema of the lower limbs 257]] due to venous compression by adenopathies.
