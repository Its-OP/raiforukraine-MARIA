*The most common tumour in men over the age of 50. It is usually asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and progresses slowly in most cases.

*Benign prostatic hyperplasia 127]] should not be confused with prostate cancer. It develops at the expense of the transition zone.
*Adenocarcinoma is the most common form (95% of prostate cancers) and develops preferentially in the peripheral zone of the prostate.
*Other very rare histological forms include neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoma and sarcoma.
*The ISUP histo-pronostic score (formerly Gleason) characterises the degree of differentiation of the tumour. Tumours with a score of 1 are the best differentiated (least aggressive) and tumours with a score of 5 are the least differentiated (most aggressive).
