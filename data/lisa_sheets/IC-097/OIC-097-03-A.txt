'''Clinical'''

Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute axonal motor neuropathy evolve in three phases: extension, plateau and recovery.

By definition, the extension phase lasts less than 4 weeks. It often lasts just a few days.

The clinical manifestations are :

During demyelinating Guillain-Barré syndrome '''([[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo and dizziness]], [[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]], [[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]], [[Muscular weakness SD-074|muscular weakness]], [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]], [[Facial paralysis SD-127|facial paralysis]], [[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])'''

- frequent subjective sensations (paresthesias, distal tingling in all four limbs), with an ascending course; and objective sensations (ataxia)

- pain (radiculalgia of the lower limbs).

- The motor impairment is a relatively symmetrical, extensive and severe paresis, which predominates proximally and then affects the extremities.

- paresis beginning in the lower limbs, rarely affecting the cranial (facial) nerves in the initial phase; involvement of the neck and trunk occurs later;

During acute axonal motor neuropathy:

- Pure motor impairment also affects all four limbs.

The diagnosis of acute polyradiculoneuritis is confirmed by neurophysiological examination.

Neurophysiological exploration

During demyelinating Guillain-Barré syndrome

- Abnormalities are usually delayed in relation to the clinical course.

- Initially, lengthening of F-wave latency and distal latencies

- In the state phase, demyelinating abnormalities

During acute axonal motor neuropathy:

- There are no sensory abnormalities.

- Motor potential amplitudes are reduced in all four limbs.

- Detection shows neurogenic tracings.

- There are no demyelinating abnormalities.

'''Cerebrospinal fluid'''

- Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid is not essential for diagnosis, but is useful for differential diagnosis. '''([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]])''''
