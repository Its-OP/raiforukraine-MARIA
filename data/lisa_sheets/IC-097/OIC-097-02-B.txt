Guillain-Barré syndrome'' refers to an inflammatory, demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis responsible for acute sensory-motor involvement. '''([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]])''''

Acute axonal motor neuropathy'' is a term used to describe acute inflammatory peripheral neuropathy causing acute pure motor impairment.

It should be noted that lesions in acute axonal motor neuropathy are not located specifically in the roots but in the nodes of Ranvier. It is related to Guillain-Barré syndrome in terms of its acute clinical presentation, course, dysimmune mechanisms secondary to a triggering event and treatment.
