The "seriousness of the respiratory impairment" (15 to 30% of patients will be on assisted ventilation) requires careful monitoring in intensive care as soon as the bulbar musculature worsens or is affected (swallowing or phonation disorders) '''([[Swallowing disorders or false swallowing SD-062|swallowing disorders or false swallowing]] ([[Dysphonia SD-146|dysphonia]])'''.

Poor prognosis:

- a phase of very rapid aggravation; '''([[Muscular weakness SD-074|muscular weakness]], [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]])''''

- initial bilateral facial involvement; '''([[Facial paralysis SD-127|facial paralysis]])''''

- over 60 years of age;

- non-excitability of the nerves on ENMG ;

- prolonged ventilation.

Recurrences of Guillain-Barré syndrome are very rare.

During the aggravation phase, therefore, it is important to ensure surveillance and screening:

- swallowing disorders '''([[Swallowing disorders or faux-route SD-062|swallowing disorders or faux-route]])''' or phonation disorders '''([[Dysphonia SD-146|dysphonia]])''''''

- breathing difficulties: effectiveness of coughing, respiratory rhythm, vital capacity using a portable spirometer to assess vital capacity. '''([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|acute respiratory distress]], [[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]], [[Cough SD-167|cough]])''''

During the status phase :

Patients are transferred to an intensive care unit if there is a risk of respiratory decompensation or complications (infectious or dysautonomic).

- Vegetative disorders: changes in heart rate, changes in blood pressure

- Decubitus complications: infections, venous thrombosis '''([[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SD-276|management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]])''''
