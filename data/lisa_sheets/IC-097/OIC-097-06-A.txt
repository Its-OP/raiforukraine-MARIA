'''Cerebrospinal fluid'''

Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid '''([[Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (lcs) SD-183|analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]])''' reveals :

- hyperproteinorachia, which may exceed 1 g/l, delayed by 3 to 10 days from clinical onset

- an absence of cellular reaction (< 10 mm<sup>3</sup>)

- a pleocytosis greater than 50/mm<sup>3</sup> should suggest another diagnosis, such as infectious meningoradiculitis
