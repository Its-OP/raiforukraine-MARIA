'''Microbiological definition:'''

- HIV: member of the retrovirus family: enveloped RNA viruses with the ability to retrotranscribe into DNA

- High genomic variability

- Two types: HIV-1 (most widespread) and HIV-2 (West Africa)

- Replication cycle :
[[File:HIV cycle.png|thumbnail]]


- Recognition between the HIV surface glycoprotein, the CD4 molecule and the CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor on the surface of the CD4 T lymphocyte

- Attachment and fusion of viral and cell membranes

- Decapsidation of the viral particle

- Retrotranscription of viral RNA into double-stranded viral DNA using the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase

- Integration of double-stranded viral DNA into the cellular genome using the HIV viral enzyme integrase

- Hijacking of cellular machinery for the benefit of the virus, with transcription of viral messenger RNA

- Translation of viral messenger RNA into a viral polyprotein

- Cleavage of the viral polyprotein by the HIV protease enzyme

- Assembling a new viral particle

- Budding on the surface of the CD4 T cell, the CD4 T cell dies

- Maturation of the new viral particle, which can go on to infect a new CD4 LT

Physiopathology

- Chronic infection, progressing throughout the life of the infected individual

- HIV target cell = CD4 T lymphocyte, a cell (i) with a long half-life and (ii) capable of dividing --> the virus ensures its survival in the body

- Active replication from the moment of primary infection, with the formation of an intracellular viral reservoir (viral DNA integrated into the genome of infected CD4 LTs).

- Immune and humoral responses slightly reduce the level of replication, creating a state of equilibrium between the host and the virus.

- Over time, progressive destruction of CD4 T cells (i) directly as the virus multiplies and (ii) indirectly with immune activation and loss of CD4 T cells.

- Consequence = AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, which is the final clinical phase of the infection, with the development of opportunistic infections as soon as the LT CD4 count falls below 200/mm<sup>3</sup>.

- '''AIDS is a CLINICAL definition'': it is the occurrence of opportunistic infections. A patient can have 120 LT CD4/mm<sup>3</sup> and if he has no opportunistic infection, he does not have AIDS.
