Reminder: any sub-acute febrile dyspnoea in an immunocompromised patient not receiving cotriomoxazole prophylaxis should raise the possibility of pulmonary pneumocystis.

The chest X-ray may be almost normal at the very beginning of the symptoms, then show a bilateral diffuse interstitial syndrome.

The chest CT scan shows diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities, sometimes sparing the periphery of the lung, sometimes with cysts, nodules or condensations.
