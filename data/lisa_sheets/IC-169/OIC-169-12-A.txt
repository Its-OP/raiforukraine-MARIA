'''<u>Different screening tests</u>''''

- '''Screening test: combined test (4<sup>th</sup> generation ELISA)''' detects anti-HIV 1 and 2 antibodies without determining specificity and also allows detection of p24 antigen. Positive 15 days after infection. A negative result indicates the absence of HIV infection, except in the case of a presumed exposure dating back less than 6 weeks.

- '''Confirmatory test:''' used to determine the specificity of anti-HIV antibodies present in the serum (Western blot, immunoblot) and to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

- p24 antigen (HIV-1 capsid) tested in serum alone or by ELISA combined with antibody detection. Positive 15 days after infection and negative when antibodies appear.

- HIV RNA (HIV genome) detected by PCR in plasma. Positive 10 days after infection.

- '''Test rapide d'orientation diagnostique (TROD'')''). Detects only HIV antibodies in a drop of blood. A negative result cannot be interpreted in the case of risk-taking dating back less than 3 months.


<u>''Diagnostic strategy for HIV infection: in two stages''</u>

1/ positive 4th generation ELISA screening test, to be confirmed by a confirmatory Western-Blot test on the same sample.

2/ if the western blot is positive, a second sample (4th generation ELISA) must be taken to rule out mistaken identity.
