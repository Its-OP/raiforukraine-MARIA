* '''<u>Transmission</u>'''

'''<u>Sexual transmission</u>''': sperm, vaginal secretions

o Decreasing risk according to the type of intercourse: receptive anal > insertive anal > receptive vaginal > insertive vaginal > receptive fellatio

o A single act of unprotected intercourse can be enough to transmit the infection

o ''It has now been demonstrated that an HIV-positive person treated with effective antiretroviral drugs, with an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months, does not transmit the virus to his or her sexual partners, even in the absence of a condom''.

This is known as TasP (treatment as prevention). It should be remembered, however, that only condoms protect against other STIs.

'''<u>Transmission by blood and its derivatives</u>''''

o The risk associated with blood transfusion has been virtually eliminated since the use of molecular tests for screening blood and organ donations.

o Very significant reduction in the risk associated with sharing injection equipment (single-use equipment made available to IVDUs)

o Occupational blood exposure accidents: low risk but varies depending on the situation (see item 366).

'''<u>Vertical transmission from mother to child</u>''''

o Mainly at the time of delivery, or post-partum through breast-feeding, if the mother has a positive viral load.

o The risk is virtually nil if the woman is already on antiretroviral treatment with an undetectable plasma viral load before conception.

* '''<u>Prevention</u>''''

'''<u>Combined prevention</u>''''

Combination of prevention methods (1) behavioural, (2) pre-exposure treatment (PrEP), (3) screening, (4) effective antiretroviral treatment for anyone living with HIV (TasP), (5) post-exposure treatment (PET) and (6) prevention of mother-to-child transmission.

1- Behavioural methods

o Information campaigns

o Promoting condom use

o Making available and promoting the use of sterile single-use equipment for IVDUs, and making available and promoting opiate substitution treatments.

o Universal precautionary measures against the occupational risk of exposure to blood

'''2 - Screening: situations justifying the prescription of an HIV serology test'''

o Populations at risk

- MSM: every 3 months

- Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa

- Population of the French departments of America and the other Caribbean countries

- UDIV

- Population in precarious situations

- Sex workers

o Targeted screening

- Suspicion or diagnosis of STI or HCV infection

- Suspicion or diagnosis of tuberculosis

- Pregnancy plans and current pregnancy

- 1<sup>rst</sup> prescription for contraception

- Rape

- Entry into detention or during imprisonment

- So blood and organs

o General population

- At least once in your life between the ages of 15 and 70

3 - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)

o Based on the same rationale as anti-malarial prophylaxis: start treatment just before exposure, continue treatment as long as you are exposed, then stop when you are no longer exposed.

o HIV-negative people who have sex without systematic condom protection (particularly MSM)

o consists of dual antiretroviral therapy with emtricitabine + tenofovir disoproxil (TRUVADA Â®) taken continuously or intermittently at the time of sexual intercourse.

o Part of comprehensive care, including regular STI screening and vaccination against HBV, HAV and HPV where indicated

'''4 - TasP: "Treatment as prevention"''''

o ''It has now been demonstrated that an HIV-positive person treated with effective antiretroviral drugs, with an undetectable viral load for at least 6 months, does not transmit the virus to his or her sexual partners, even in the absence of a condom''.

This is known as TasP.

5 - Post-exposure treatment (see item 366)

'''6 - Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (see item 27)'''

o Offer an HIV serology test to all pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant

o Suggest serology in the 6th month of pregnancy in the event of risk-taking during pregnancy

o Remember to screen the partner

o Based on the same principle as TasP, the risk is virtually nil if the woman is already on antiretroviral treatment with an undetectable plasma viral load before conception.

o The most important thing is for the viral load to be undetectable at the time of delivery: monthly monitoring of the maternal viral load

o Systematic prophylactic treatment of newborns with anti-retrovirals for 2 to 4 weeks

o Breast-feeding prohibited
