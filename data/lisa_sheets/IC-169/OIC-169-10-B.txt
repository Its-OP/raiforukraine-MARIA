Multiple lesions (multiple lesions are highly suggestive of toxoplasmosis in the context of immunodepression)

radiological appearance (CT or MRI): typical cocardial appearance with peripheral enhancement (abscess walls). The cocoon-shaped lesion is surrounded by a halo of peri-lesional oedema (hypodense on CT / T2-Flair hypersignal on MRI).
