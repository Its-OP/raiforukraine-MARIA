- focal neurological syndrome: main hypothesis to be considered = cerebral toxoplasmosis

Diagnosis by MRI (multiple abscessed lesions), positive blood serology (reactivation) +/- PCR on CSF

Differential diagnosis: cerebral lymphoma to be considered if there is no response to anti-infective treatment on follow-up imaging.

- signs of encephalitis in a highly immunocompromised patient: main hypotheses to be considered = tuberculous meningoencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalitis (PML, linked to JC virus, if CD4 < 100/mm3), HIV encephalitis, CMV encephalitis.

diagnostic guidance based on lumbar puncture and imaging (MRI), with broad indications in cases of profound immunodepression

- Meningitis in AIDS patients: don't forget neuro-meningeal cryptococcosis in cases of profound immunodepression (CD4<100/mm3). It should be considered in the setting of intractable headache in an immunocompromised HIV+ patient,

absence of frank meningeal syndrome, usually with signs of ICCH in the foreground, CSF hyperpressure on LP. Diagnosis: yeast detection on LP (Indian ink staining), cryptococcal antigen detection in blood and CSF.
