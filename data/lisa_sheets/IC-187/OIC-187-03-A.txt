Superficial urticaria

The primary lesion is an edematous papule (Figure 5), erythematous with a clear border and sometimes a lighter centre.
There is no particular topography.
The shape and size of the papules may vary; there may be annular or polycyclic lesions, and the papules may range from a few millimetres to large, geographically-contoured plaques.
The 3 major characteristics of these oedematous papules in superficial urticaria are their "puriginous, fleeting and migratory" nature.




Deep urticaria or angioedema
[[File:Figure 6 .jpg|vignette|''urticaria profunda or angioedema of the lips.'']]
The primary lesion is a firm, non-itchy, pinkish-white oedema (Figure 6) with a sensation of tension or pain. This oedema is transient, receding within 72 hours without scarring, and most often occurs in areas rich in mast cells: the face, extremities and external genitalia.
In the case of anaphylaxis, the oedema may be of laryngeal or pharyngeal origin, which may affect the prognosis.

'''Superficial urticaria is isolated in 50% of cases.'''

'''Superficial urticaria is associated with deep urticaria in 40% of cases.'''

'''Deep urticaria is isolated in 10% of cases.'''
