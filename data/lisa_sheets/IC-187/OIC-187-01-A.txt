Urticaria is a frequent inflammatory dermatosis (15-20% of the population in its acute form) secondary to the activation of masctocytes by complex immunological or non-immunological mechanisms. It is diagnosed clinically. The course of the disease is usually acute and sometimes chronic, with flare-ups occurring daily or almost daily for more than 6 weeks at a time.
Acute urticaria is usually non-allergic, although it may be allergic in rare cases.
