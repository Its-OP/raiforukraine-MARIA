1) Clothing products: clothing (dyes), footwear (leather, glue, rubber, etc.) and nickel accessories (costume jewellery, trouser buttons, belt buckles, etc.).

2) Cosmetics: perfume, shampoo, deodorant, hair dye, nail varnish, etc.

3) Medicines for cutaneous application (topical): antiseptics, anti-inflammatory creams, etc.

4) Occupational allergens

Some allergens only cause eczema after exposure to ultraviolet UV rays (sunlight). These are known as photoallergens. Certain medicines or cosmetics can cause this type of contact eczema.
