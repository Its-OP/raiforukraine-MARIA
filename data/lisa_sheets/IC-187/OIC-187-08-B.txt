Atopy is defined as a predisposing condition to abnormal IgE-mediated immunological reactivity to certain environmental antigens (allergens).

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common and earliest clinical manifestation associated with atopy. It is a complex polygenic disease involving 2 groups of genes: on the one hand, epidermal barrier genes (filaggrin gene++); on the other, genes regulating the adaptive and innate immune system.   

Environmental factors play a major role in the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis, but these have not yet been clearly identified. On the other hand, a number of favourable factors have been documented (e.g. exposure to cats in early childhood).
