Urticaria results from dermal oedema (superficial urticaria) or dermo-hypodermal oedema (deep urticaria or angioedema) due to tissue vasodilatation with increased capillary permeability secondary to the release by mast cells of various mediators, the main one being histamine.

Mast cell activation can occur by 2 mechanisms:
- Immunological: via IgE or IgG-type autoantibodies
- Non-immunological: by direct activation of mast cells via different receptors on their surface or by the direct pharmacological action of certain drugs (e.g. NSAIDs).
