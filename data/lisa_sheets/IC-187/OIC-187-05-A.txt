In a minority of cases, acute urticaria may be secondary to an allergy or immediate hypersensitivity called anaphylaxis.

This is not the case with chronic urticaria, which is never secondary to anaphylaxis.


In the case of anaphylaxis, urticaria may be isolated, but more often than not there are associated signs that suggest the diagnosis of anaphylaxis;

- Respiratory signs: dysphonia, dyspnoea, bronchospasm

- Cardiovascular signs: tachycardia, bradycardia, arterial hypotension

- Digestive signs: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea

- Neurological signs: headaches, convulsions

In extreme cases, anaphylactic shock with cardiorespiratory arrest may occur.
