|Order=18}}The treatment of contact eczema is based on 2 principles:

* Avoid contact with the allergen: this is the most important aspect of the treatment (secondary prevention).
* Dermocorticoid'', 1 application daily until the eczema has healed, usually about ten days.
** Cream or ointment depending on the site:
*** cream (folds or oozing lesion)
*** ointment (the rest of the body outside the folds, and on non-oozing lesions).

After an eczema flare-up, a ''moisturising cream'' is recommended to combat skin flaking, which follows the inflammatory phase of eczema.
