|Order=14}}The eruption classically evolves in '''four often superimposed phases'' :

Erythematous'' with poorly defined redness associated with vesicular oedema with small vesicles filled with clear fluid

The opening of the vesicles (sometimes confluent - formation of bubbles) causes an ''ooze''.

This is followed by the formation of "scabs" which fall off in one to two weeks (transitory pinkish scars).

'''Pruritus (itching) is constant.'''

The clinical appearance varies depending on the location: classic form (all over the body except the face), oedematous form on the eyelids, dysidrosic form with vesicles embedded in the stratum corneum (palms and soles).

''In allergic contact eczema, lesions start at the site where the allergen is applied'' and can then gradually spread to the rest of the body.
