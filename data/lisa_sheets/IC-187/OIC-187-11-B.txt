The main complications are infectious:

- Superinfection by staphylococcus aureus, clinically difficult to diagnose.

arguments: presence of purulent discharge, vesiculo-bullous lesions, melicoid crusts

'''CAUTION: light yellow oozing from acute lesions is not a sign of superinfection'''


- Superinfection with the herpes virus (HSV-1 ++, classic but rare 5% )

-can occur after a primary infection in young children, after a herpetic recurrence or after contact with an infected person (children kissed by an adult with a herpetic recurrence).

-clinically: sudden worsening and appearance of multiple vesicular lesions rapidly progressing to punctiform, umbilicated skin erosions.

'''-This is an emergency situation which contraindicates dermocorticoids and must lead to the rapid initiation of anti-viral treatment (aciclovir per os or IV if extensive involvement or oral route impossible), the dosage of which is the same for adults and children aged 2 and over).    '''

other complications : -impact on quality of life (chronic illness)

                                   -contact eczema due to sensitisation to allergens in topical products (emollients++) applied to the skin
