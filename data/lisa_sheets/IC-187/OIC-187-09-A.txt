</gallery>The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is exclusively clinical

====The clinical aspects differ according to whether the disease is acute or chronic====
- acute phase: acute eczema.

elementary lesions: erythema, oedema, vesicles whose rupture leads to oozing and then crusts, pruritus, crumbled contours (Fig 1)

- chronic phase: erythematosquamous lesions and/or lichenification (thickening of the skin - irregular squared appearance)

(Fig 2 : lichenification)
<br />

===='''The location of the lesions varies according to age:'''====
- Infant: starts on the face and scalp and extends to the sides of the limbs and trunk; area under the nappy and mid-face area (nose) spared.

- Early childhood: localised in the flexion creases of the limbs (knees, elbows++) and often the ankles.

- older children: frequent lichenification induced by chronic scratching.

- adolescents and adults: face and neck++ with rare but typical localisations: lips (atopic cheilitis), eyelids with sometimes ophthalmological complications (keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis), lower limbs (lichenification, prurigo).

====Development====
AD most often begins in the first 12 months of life. It usually develops in winter flare-ups, but can develop continuously (severe form). Improvement or even "cure" occurs in childhood, but 3 to 5% of children progress to an adult form, particularly those with a severe form.

It should be noted that a late onset in adulthood is possible but rare. It is a diagnosis of elimination which should lead to a search for other pathologies, in particular: scabies, contact eczema, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, etc.
