|Order=13}}Allergic contact dermatitis is an allergic hypersensitivity specific to a given antigen (called an "allergen"). It is an adaptive inflammatory reaction mediated by CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD8+ T cells). It is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction or type IV in the Gel and Coombs classification (Figure 1).

There are two pathophysiological phases:

#An asymptomatic sensitisation phase: in non-sensitised individuals, the allergen penetrates the epidermis and is picked up by skin dendritic cells, which migrate to the lymph nodes and present the allergen to naïve LTCD8+. The naïve LTCD8+ that recognise the allergen then differentiate into cytotoxic memory LTCD8+, which circulate throughout the body, particularly in the skin. This sensitisation phase is asymptomatic and may last from a few days to a few years. The onset of sensitisation is correlated with the duration of exposure and the concentration of the allergen.
#Symptomatic phase (allergic contact dermatitis): When the skin comes into contact with the allergen again, the allergen-specific memory LTCD8+ react against the epithelial cells which are covered with allergen and trigger an inflammatory reaction which is expressed clinically in the form of eczema and histologically in the form of an infiltrate of lymphocytes in the epidermis (exocytosis) and epidermal oedema (spongiosis).  It takes 24 to 48 hours for contact eczema to appear after contact with the allergen in an already sensitised individual.
