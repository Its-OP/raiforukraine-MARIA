Breast-feeding should be preferred for all children. It covers all the needs of infants up to the age of 6 months, with the exception of vitamins D and K, which need to be supplemented with medication. Beyond the age of 6 months, iron supplements are necessary if breast-feeding is exclusive or predominant.

When the mother does not wish to or cannot breastfeed, the child must be fed with an infant formula. These formulas meet all the nutritional requirements of infants, except for vitamin D, which needs to be supplemented with medication.

Standard" milk formulas are suitable for the vast majority of infants. They are given during the first 4-6 months of life.

The indications for specific milk preparations are as follows.

- Hypoallergenic milks (HA) whose proteins have been partially hydrolysed: these were indicated for the prevention of allergic reactions in at-risk children. This indication is no longer consensual.

- Anti-regurgitation milks (AR) thickened with starch or carob flour: indicated in the event of regurgitation.

- Lactose-free milk in which the lactose has been replaced by maltose dextrin: severe acute diarrhoea requiring hospitalisation and recurrence or persistence of diarrhoea 5-7 days after reintroduction of milk.

- Extensively hydrolysed protein hydrolysates: indicated in cases of allergy to cow's milk proteins.
