The main [[Behavioural disorders in children and adolescents SD-133|behavioural disorders]] syndromes in young subjects are ''oppositional defiant disorder'' and ''conduct disorder.''' They are also called ''externalizing disorders''.

Their duration > 6 months distinguishes them from the transient behavioural disorders that characterise certain [[Stress and adaptation to stress; Adjustment disorders 2C-066-DE-A05|Adjustment disorders]].

Behavioural disorders may also occur in the course of [[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety disorders]], mood disorders (cf. Item 66 [[Characterised depressive episode; Recurrent depressive disorder 2C-066-DE-A01]]), in [[Schizophrenic disorders of adolescents and adults|schizophrenic disorders]] and in certain organic pathologies (lesion or infectious/inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system).
