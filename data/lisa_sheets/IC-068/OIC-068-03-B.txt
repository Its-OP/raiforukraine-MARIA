== Epidemiology
Behavioural problems are a frequent reason for consultation:

* TOP - average prevalence 3%; sex ratio 1.4G/1F
* TC - average prevalence 1.5%; sex ratio 3-4G/1F

== Risk factors
The aetiology of behavioural disorders is multifactorial. They result from an individual-environment interaction. Some risk factors have direct and indirect effects or act through common underlying mechanisms.

=== Genetic/neurobiological factors ===

* Family aggregation (heritability between 35-60%)
* Inhibition deficit and abnormalities in danger processing
* Low reactivity to stress, autonomic nervous system abnormalities

=== Cognitive factors ===

* Hostile attribution bias in social relations
* Verbal deficits
* Deficits in executive functions

=== Environmental factors ===

* Coercive or inconsistent parenting style
* Disorganised attachment style
* Parental psychopathology
* Psychological and/or physical violence SD-351|Exposure to violence
* Criminogenic environment/deviant peers

=== Perinatal factors ===

*Perinatal complications
*Low birth weight
*Exposure to toxic substances ([[Alcohol and pregnancy: mechanism - Dose-effect relationship 2C-027-EP-B07|Alcohol]], Tobacco)
