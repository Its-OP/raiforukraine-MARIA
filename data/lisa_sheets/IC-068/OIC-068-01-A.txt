== Definitions

* Puberty: a developmental process characterised by hormonal and physical changes leading to the ability to reproduce.
* Adolescence: a period of individual and social maturation leading to autonomy, varying in length and nature depending on the social context.

== Psychosocial development in adolescence
Main changes :

* Physical and hormonal changes
* Differential maturation of the central nervous system (cortico-limbic asychrony), neuro-plasticity
* Changes in sexual desire and relationship with the body
* Emotional hypersensitivity
* Experimentation, risky choices
* Social autonomy, search for identity/values


This period of developmental change calls for "adaptation skills".

This is a period of emergence or increase in the prevalence of many "mental disorders" ("depressive episode", "bipolar disorder in adolescents and adults", "schizophrenic disorder in adolescents and adults", "eating disorders in adolescents and adults (see item 253)"..)<br />
