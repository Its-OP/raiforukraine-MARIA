In small children, low-energy fractures lead to butter clod fractures or epiphyseal fracture-decollement. Plastic deformation of the bones is also one of the forms encountered at this age.

In children, the most common fractures are epiphyseal dislocations, green wood fractures and metaphyseal fractures.

In adolescents, the fractures encountered are type III or IV epiphyseal dislocations, apophyseal fracture-avulsions and complete fractures.
