*Cryptorchidism is the consequence of a halt in the embryological migration of the testicle along the normal path between the lumbar region (where it is formed) and the scrotum (where it should be at birth).
*The incidence is higher in premature newborns.
*The anomaly is most often unilateral. It is bilateral in 10 to 20% of cases.
*On clinical examination, it is impossible to palpate the testicle in the bursa. The hernial orifices are closed.
*Three topographical diagnoses are possible:
**An undescended testicle which can be palpated on the normal migration path: the gonad is in the inguinal canal or at the upper root of the bursa.
**An undescended testicle that can be palpated outside its normal migratory route: formerly known as "true ectopia", the testicle may be in a femoral, pubopenic or crossed intrascrotal position.
**An undescended testicle that cannot be palpated.
*If, on clinical examination, the testicle is easily lowered by hand to the bottom of the bursa without tension, this is an oscillating testicle ("lift") and not cryptorchidism.
