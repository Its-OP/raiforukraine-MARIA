*In children, the diagnosis is clinical. There is no room for additional examinations because no imaging technique is really effective (HAS, pertinence des soins, February 2018).
*If the testicle cannot be felt on clinical examination, the child should be referred to a paediatric surgeon.
*If the testicle cannot be palpated under general anaesthetic, laparoscopic exploration for diagnostic +/- therapeutic purposes is indicated.
*In adults, surveillance by imaging (scanner, MRI) is recommended for an unpalpated testicle, as cryptorchidism is a major risk factor for [[2C-313|cancer of the testicle (313)]].
