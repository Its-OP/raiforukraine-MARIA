*Scrotal ultrasound is useful in cases of diagnostic doubt with a cyst of the epididymis (or cord), or in cases of so-called acute hydrocele (large hydrocele under tension) to eliminate a differential diagnosis of strangulated inguino-scrotal hernia or torsion of the spermatic cord or [[Testicular tumours|tumour of the testicle (313)]]. In the case of a hydrocele, it confirms the diagnosis and reveals an effusion in the vagina surrounding the testicle (anechogenic collection). In adults, it is used to assess the condition of the underlying testicle in order to rule out a hydrocele as a reaction to orchi-epidydimitis or associated with a testicular tumour.
*Percutaneous puncture is contraindicated.
