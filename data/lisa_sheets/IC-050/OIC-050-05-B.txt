* <big>The diagnosis is primarily clinical</big>.

== Bacteriological test for aetiology: ==

*ECBU with antibiotic susceptibility test (which may be sterile)
*PCR of Chlamydia trachomatis and gonococcus on the 1st urine stream in young men.
*Sampling of any urethral discharge (for C. trachomatis and gonococcus)
*Blood cultures, rarely positive (mainly in cases of BGN infection).

*If there is any doubt about the diagnosis and the spermatic cord has been twisted for more than 24 hours, a scrotal ultrasound scan may be useful.


The disease can progress to abscess and purulent melting of the testicle, necrotising fasciitis, testicular atrophy, etc.
