*If an STI is suspected, either ceftriaxone 500 mg in 1 IM injection, followed by Doxycycline 200mg/d for 10 days, or ofloxacin 200mg twice daily for 10 days.
*If it is not a sexually transmitted infection, the antibiotic treatment is that of a male urinary infection targeting enterobacteria and is based on a fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or 3rd generation cephalosporin secondarily adapted to the antibiogram.
*In children, the first-line antibiotic treatment is cotrimoxazole.
*The duration of treatment in adults and children is the same as for male urinary tract infections, 14 days.
*Wearing a jockstrap (or tight briefs) and prescribing painkillers are recommended.
