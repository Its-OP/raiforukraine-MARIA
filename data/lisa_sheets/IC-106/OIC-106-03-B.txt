*Progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigro-striatal pathway]].
*Loss of 50 to 60% of the neurons necessary before the onset of the motor signs of the Parkinsonian triad.
*The neurodegenerative process goes beyond the [[extrapyramidal motor circuit|nigro-striatal pathway]], explaining the occurrence of other motor signs (e.g. axial signs) and non-motor signs (e.g. cognitive disorders ([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]) resistant to dopaminergic treatment.
*Presence of Lewy bodies (intraneuronal inclusions containing abnormal aggregates of alpha-synuclein) (Lewy bodies are indicated in the photo below with black arrows).
*Etiology unknown, but several genetic and environmental (pesticides) factors ([[Voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug SD-340|voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug]]) have been identified.
