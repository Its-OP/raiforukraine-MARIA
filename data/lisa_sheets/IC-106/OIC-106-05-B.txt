Motor complications of dopaminergic treatment: appear on average 4 to 5 years after the onset of the disease.

*The young age of onset of the disease, the duration of progression and the dose of L-dopa are risk factors for the early appearance of motor complications.
*A distinction is made between fluctuations in treatment efficacy and dyskinesias ([[Abnormal movements SD-126|abnormal movements]]).

=== <u>Fluctuations in treatment efficacy:</u> reappearance of parkinsonian signs at a distance from drug intake (blockages); ===

*<u>Akinesia at the end of the dose</u>.

Parkinsonian signs appear before the next dopaminergic treatment is taken.

*<u>Akinesia at night and in the early morning</u>.

In addition to sluggishness, the symptoms include calf and toe cramps and difficulty turning in bed.

*<On/off phenomenon

This is reflected in sometimes fairly abrupt changes from a non-parkinsonian state ("on") to a severe parkinsonian state ("off").

=== <u>Involuntary movements: dyskinesias</u> ([[Abnormal movements SD-126|abnormal movements]]) ===

* <u>Mid or peak dose dyskinesias</u>.

Involuntary choreic movements of the limbs and trunk, occurring during the phase of maximum efficacy of dopaminergic treatment.

*<u>Bi-phasic dyskinesias</u>.

Involuntary, rather dystonic movements of the lower limbs (often painful) ([[Pain in a limb (upper or lower) SD-071|pain in a limb]]), occurring during the transition between the parkinsonian state and the non-parkinsonian state (beginning or end of dose).


In the advanced stages, the patient oscillates between a severe parkinsonian state and phases of corrected parkinsonian symptomatology complicated by the presence of dyskinesias.
