=== Drugs likely to induce parkinsonian syndrome ([[Voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug SD-340|voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug]]) ===

* Mainly induced by neuroleptics (antipsychotics) or "hidden" neuroleptics (antinauseants such as metoclopramide and metopimazine, sedatives such as alimemazine), which should be carefully investigated during questioning.
* Calcium inhibitors such as flunarizine (background treatment for migraine) and antidepressants are more rarely responsible for a parkinsonian syndrome.
* If in doubt, consult the Vidal.

=== Clinical features of iatrogenic parkinsonian syndromes: ===

* Parkinson's syndrome, rather symmetrical (inconstant characteristic).
* More frequently a postural or action tremor than an authentic resting tremor ([[Tremor SD-128|tremor]]).
* Potential presence of oral-lingual-facial dyskinesias ([[Abnormal movements SD-126|abnormal movements]]).
* No response to dopaminergic treatment.
