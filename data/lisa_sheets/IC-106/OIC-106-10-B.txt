=== Before 65-70 ===

* LP dopamine agonist monotherapy (delays onset of motor complications) or monoamine oxidase B inhibitor (MAOI-B). These two therapies may be combined. If there is a history of addiction, dopamine agonists should be prescribed with great caution (potential risk of impulse control disorders).
* If control is unsatisfactory, increase the dosage of the dopamine agonist. If unsatisfactory control or poor tolerance, combination with L-dopa or B-AMI.
* Treatment with L-dopa and a DDC inhibitor may be started immediately in cases of motor disability and impairment of quality of life, which must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Gradually propose 3 to 4 doses per day (as Â½ life is short) before meals to facilitate absorption and efficacy.
* In the event of nausea or vomiting (nausea, vomiting), treatment with domperidone may be prescribed (reduction in side-effects due to stimulation of peripheral dopamine receptors; contraindicated if QTc time is prolonged), limiting prescription to the shortest duration of treatment (usually 7 days maximum).
* Anticholinergics: see above.

=== After 65-70 years ===

* L-dopa with DDC inhibitor as initial monotherapy or MAOI-B.
* If control is unsatisfactory, increase dosage of L-dopa or combine with MAOI-B.
* Co-prescription of domperidone as recommended above.
