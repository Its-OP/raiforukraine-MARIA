The provisional placement order (OPP) is a measure defined by articles 375 et seq. of the Civil Code relating to educational assistance.

It allows an unemancipated minor to be "placed" with a person (a family member or a trustworthy third party) or in a structure that can provide reception and accommodation (e.g. a departmental child welfare service or a child psychiatry service for assessment and/or specialised care).
