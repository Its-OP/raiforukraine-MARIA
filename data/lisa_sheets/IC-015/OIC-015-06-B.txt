The judge's OPP decision requires a prior medical opinion. A detailed medical certificate must be drawn up by a doctor from outside the host establishment. The initial decision is taken for a period of less than 15 days. The measure may be renewed, following a medical opinion from a psychiatrist at the host institution (CM), for a renewable period of one month.

The judge may rule at the request of the father and mother jointly, or one of them, the person or service to whom the child has been entrusted, the guardian, the minor himself or herself or the public prosecutor.

In an emergency, the public prosecutor has the same powers as the children's judge to decide on an OPP, subject to referring the matter to the competent judge within 8 days.

The parents retain the right to correspond with each other and the right to visit and stay with each other (conditions set by the judge in the best interests of the minor - e.g. visiting rights in the presence of a third party designated by the establishment, which may also suspend them temporarily or decide to make the place of residence anonymous in the event of danger).
