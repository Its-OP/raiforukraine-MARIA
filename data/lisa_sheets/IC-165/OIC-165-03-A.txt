'''The diagnosis is essentially clinical (presence of parotitis)''' to be evoked in case of contagion and/or absence of vaccination

* Invasive phase: moderate fever, headache, earache
* Status phase: usually unilateral or bilateral parotitis (pear-shaped face), possibly associated with adenopathy and involvement of the submaxillary and sublingual glands.
* Clinical presentations associated with complications of the infection (meningitis, orchitis and/or oophoritis, pancreatitis) may also point towards a diagnosis of mumps.
