Strictly human reservoir''.

Urulin virus receptor: sialic acid, an acylated derivative of neuraminic acid, present on cellular glycoproteins and lipids, enabling the virus to infect a large number of cell types.

'''Direct human-to-human transmission:'''<blockquote>
* Contamination by spread of Pfl√ºge droplets or by direct contact of saliva/urines.
* Incubation of 16 to 18 days, followed by a short viremia.
* Dissemination to systemic organs via lymphatic routes. Preferential targets are glandular tissues (parotid glands, testicles, ovaries, mammary glands, pancreas) and the central nervous system.
* Contagious via the respiratory tract and saliva for around 15 days: around 6 days before clinical symptoms and up to 10 days afterwards.
