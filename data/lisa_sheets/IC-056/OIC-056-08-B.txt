An aetiological approach to be carried out in parallel with the implementation of treatment.

Aetiological orientation is based on the systems affected (central or peripheral motor impairment, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment), the age of onset of the disorders (antenatal/neonatal/post-natal), and their course (stability, improvement, regression).

A distinction must be made between genetic causes (malformations, chromosomal or gene abnormalities, etc.) and accidental causes (perinatal anoxia, cranial trauma, meningitis, etc.).

Depending on the diagnostic hypotheses, brain imaging (MRI), genetic tests and electroencephalograms may be carried out.
