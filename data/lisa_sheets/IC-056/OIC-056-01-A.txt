Disability in children ([[Situation of disability SD-345]]) = situation resulting from the interaction between state of health, activities, participation, environmental and personal factors.

A child with a disability has one or more impairments and does not have the activities and participation of children in his or her age group.

Specific features to be taken into account:

- Notion of learning (maturing brain) ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115]])

- Age-related activities

- Notion of musculoskeletal growth (secondary deformations) ([[Joint deformation SD-070]])

- Paediatric pathologies ([[Paediatric follow-up consultation SD-296]])

- Participation: family, schools, leisure

- Environment: importance of family support ([[Overall support for a carer SD-330]])


Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD): Children with disabilities have the ''same rights as other children'' - for example, to health care, nutrition, education, social inclusion and protection from violence, abuse and neglect.
