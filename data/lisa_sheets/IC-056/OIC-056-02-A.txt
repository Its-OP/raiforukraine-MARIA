'''Multi-disability or multi-handicap'' = coexistence of several impairments in the same child

'''Surhandicap''' = the occurrence of one or more secondary impairments linked to the pre-existing disability, without being directly linked to the initial pathology.

'''Multiple disability'''= concerns people with early cerebral dysfunction, having irreversible consequences with serious disturbances in motor, perceptive and cognitive efficiency and in the construction of relationships with the physical and human environment. These people are extremely vulnerable, physically, mentally and socially, and are totally dependent on a third party.
