Multidisciplinary and coordinated functional assessment to identify the needs of the child and his family.

'''ICF-based assessment''': impairment/activity/participation/environmental factors/personal factors. Use of tools adapted to the chronological age, expected in relation to those of a child of the same age.

Assessing the child's performance and abilities

> the assessments enable ''the child to be evaluated in relation to typical development'', it is worth proposing ''regular'' assessments at different ages ([[Anomaly of psychomotor development SD-115]]).

Stagnation in psychomotor development or unexpected deterioration> diagnosis to be reconsidered.


To be taken into account: the child's immediate environment (parents). Low level of parental education, psycho-affective and socio-economic vulnerability= aggravating factors in the child's disability. ([[Overall support for a carer SD-330]]) ([[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347)]]



Objective of the assessments= to support the child, his/her parents and the people around him/her (rehabilitation professionals, teachers, etc.) in order to identify his/her specific needs and support his/her development accordingly. [[Situation de handicap SD-345|(Situation de handicap SD-345)]]
