MDPH= Maison Départementale des Personnes en Situation de Handicap (Departmental House for People with Disabilities)

The MDPH welcomes and informs disabled people and their families.

Parents of children with disabilities should contact the MDPH. A file must be completed. It includes a section to be completed by the family (life project), a medical section (medical project) to be completed by the child's referring doctor, and the GEVA-sco (guide to assessing compensation needs in terms of schooling) for school-age children.

Parents may need help with this process ([[Overall support for a carer SD-330|overall support for a carer]]<nowiki/>t , [[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347| precarious social situation and isolation]]).

MDPH for children :

- Based on the life project, the CDAPH (Commission for the Rights and Independence of Disabled People) assesses the disability and compensation needs and draws up a personalised compensation plan (PPC).

- For school-age children, the PPC includes the drawing up of a personalised schooling plan (PPS) by a multidisciplinary team (following a proposal from the ESS monitoring and schooling team).

- notification of the allocation of benefits and services (educational and medico-social guidance AEEH, PCH, cards, etc.)


Possible assistance

- Financial benefits: AEEH, PCH

- Referral to care facilities based on the main impairment

- Schooling (mainstream environment with or without special teaching arrangements, with or without support from the SESSD/specialised teaching units in medico-social establishments and structures)
