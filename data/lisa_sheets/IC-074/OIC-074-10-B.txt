==Initiation of treatment==
The drug is chosen on the basis of its marketing authorisation for the disorder in question and its safety profile. If an anxiety disorder and a depressive episode coexist, an antidepressant with a marketing authorisation for the anxiety disorder may be chosen.

In the treatment of ''obsessive-compulsive disorder'' and ''post-traumatic stress disorder'', the ''dosage'' used is ''higher'' (often double the dose) than in the treatment of depressive episodes.

In "elderly patients", the "initial dose" should be half that used in adults, with doses gradually increased.

For anxious patients, start at half dose for a few days.

In practice, in outpatient treatment, except in special cases, it is recommended that an SRI, SNRI or possibly an antidepressant from the "other antidepressants" class should be prescribed as first-line treatment because they are better tolerated.

An imipraminic should be prescribed as a third-line treatment.

The balance between potential benefit and risk should bear in mind the small effect size of antidepressants, particularly in children and adolescents (where only fluoxetine appears to have demonstrated efficacy).

The patient is informed :

#time to efficacy (approximately 3 weeks);
#duration of treatment (at least 6 months after achieving remission, longer in the case of recurrent depressive disorder or in elderly patients);
#the possibility of withdrawal symptoms when treatment is stopped.

==Pre-therapy assessment==

*SSRIs and SRIs: no paraclinical work-up required.
*Imipraminics/IMAO: ECG, ophthalmology, renal and liver tests, EEG if history of epilepsy. An ophthalmological assessment is required if angle-closure glaucoma is suspected.
*Agomelatine: liver work-up (regulatory)

==Maintenance treatment==
During maintenance treatment, the treatment and dosage are those which enabled the depressive episode to be resolved.

Monotherapy is preferred.
