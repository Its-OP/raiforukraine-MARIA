'''Hypnotics''' are '''psychotropic''' drugs with the ability to''''induce sleep'' (or at least a ''state close to physiological sleep''). These molecules are <u>close to anxiolytics</u>, with more marked '''clinical sedative properties'''.

The class of hypnotics is made up of different chemical classes:

* benzodiazepines ('loprazolam', 'nitrazepam', 'lormetazepam', 'estazolam') and related benzodiazepines (or 'z-drugs': 'zolpidem', 'zopiclone');
* antihistamines'' and ''antipsychotics'' with a ''sedative polarity'' (''alimemazine'');
