The '''prescription of hypnotics''' and '''anxiolytics''' must be based on a '''careful analysis''' of the clinical situation, seeking to separate what falls under '''transient difficulties''' and '''reactions to a non-psychiatric pathology''', and '''confirmed psychiatric pathology'''. It must be '''<u>regularly</u> reassessed'''. It '''should not be stopped <u>brutally</u>''' after a course of treatment several weeks old.

'''As part of this prescription:'''

* There is no need to combine two anxiolytics (benzodiazepines or others) in the treatment of anxiety;
* There is no need to combine two hypnotics;
* There is no need to combine two benzodiazepines.
* There is no need to prescribe benzodiazepines without taking into account the regulatory maximum prescription periods (including the withdrawal period and with regular reassessment):
** 12 weeks for anxiolytics;
** 4 weeks for hypnotics;

* An anxiolytic or hypnotic prescription should not be initiated without complying with the official recommended doses, and without starting with the lowest dose;
* An anxiolytic or hypnotic prescription should not be systematically renewed without reassessment.


'''Concerning benzodiazepines:'''

* At the time of initiation of treatment: ''''<u>initiation</u>'':
** Treatment will be prescribed at the minimum effective dose;
** The treatment and its transient nature are explained to the patient;
** Lower doses will be used in elderly patients;
* At the time of '''<u>maintenance treatment</u>''':
** It will be stopped as soon as possible;
* At the time of ''''''<u>stopping treatment</u>'' (particularly in elderly subjects):
** Assess the patient's motivations, their attachment to the treatment ;
** Discontinuation should always be gradual, over a period of several weeks to several months;
** Specialised management should be sought for :
*** A) Associated severe psychiatric disorders;
*** B) Dependence on other drugs;
*** C) Combination with other psychotropic drugs;
*** D) intractable insomnia;
** The aim is to stop taking benzodiazepines.
** There is no argument for proposing drug replacement therapy when discontinuing benzodiazepines in elderly patients;
** Non-medicinal support measures should be put in place for as long as necessary.
