== '''The prescription''' ==

* Must comply with the ''prescribing rules'' described for ''anxiolytics'';
* Must be prescribed at the ''minimum effective dose'';
* Must be prescribed for a ''limited period'' to ''avoid the risk of pharmacological tolerance'' and ''use disorders'' (a few days for reactive insomnia, a few weeks for transient insomnia);
* Must be limited to ''4 weeks'' for ''hypnotics'';
* Treatment must not be stopped abruptly;
* Dosages should be adapted for elderly patients (lower doses);
* A ''short half-life treatment'' should be chosen for ''insomnia associated with falling asleep'' (as well as in the elderly) and a ''longer half-life treatment'' for ''insomnia during the second half of the night'';
* Patients should be "informed" of the risk of "potentiation by alcohol consumption" and the "risk of drowsiness" (driving);
* To limit the risk of misuse, zolpidem must be prescribed on a "secure prescription" for a maximum of 28 days.
