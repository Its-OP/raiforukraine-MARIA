Antipsychotics'' are substances whose common property is an ''antagonistic'' action on D2 dopamine receptors.

A distinction is made between :

* older drugs (typical or first-generation neuroleptics or antipsychotics)
* more recent compounds (atypical or second-generation antipsychotics) with a better neurological safety profile (extrapyramidal syndrome), but with a higher risk of adverse metabolic effects.
The main "first-generation" antipsychotics used in practice are :

* Chlorpromazine,
* Cyamemazine
* Alimemazine
* Levomepromazine
* Haloperidol
* Loxapine

The main "second-generation" antipsychotics used in practice are :

* Amisulpride,
* Olanzapine
* Clozapine
* Quetiapine
* Risperidone
* Paliperidone,
* Aripiprazole.
