==Undesirable effects==
The ''most frequent'' side effects (digestive effects, tremors, etc.) are, for the most part :

*early onset (at the start of treatment or after an increase in dosage),
*dose-dependent,
*and "transient".

Sexual disorders are possible and potentially persistent.
In the "elderly": monitoring of natraemia and balance.

Psychiatric adverse reactions:

*Manic mood swings (manic or mixed symptoms);
*Suicidal ideation (in patients under 24).
*Lifting of inhibition: an improvement in psychomotor inhibition may occur before a thymic improvement at the start of treatment.

==Serotonin syndrome: a rare but serious effect==

*Digestive symptoms: nausea, diarrhoea;
*Neurological symptoms: confusion, agitation, tremors, myoclonus, muscular rigidity, hyperreflexia, motor incoordination, mydriasis, akathisia, hallucinations;
*Neurovegetative symptoms: tachycardia, polypnoea, dyspnoea, hyperthermia, sweating, high or low blood pressure;

Treatment: transfer to intensive care, discontinuation of medication, fluid and electrolyte balance, fever control.

==Drug interactions==
The main drug interactions are :

*Risk of serotonin syndrome (particularly with MAOIs) if several antidepressants are combined, or if antidepressants are combined with lithium, or if antidepressants are combined with lithium;
*Risk of serotonin syndrome (particularly with MAOIs) in the case of a combination of several antidepressants or antidepressants and lithium or antidepressants and triptans.
