== Main drug interactions

* There are no formally contraindicated associations with benzodiazepines, but certain pharmacodynamics must be taken into account: potentiation of sedative effects by any other CNS depressant.
* Antihistamines: avoid combinations with other anticholinergics and other CNS depressants.
