Antipsychotics may be prescribed in "emergency" cases of agitation or suicidal crisis. Route of administration :

*per os whenever possible
*or intramuscularly.

Recommended treatments for agitation: in psychotic and bipolar disorders, a "per os" antipsychotic treatment if possible ("olanzapine", "aripiprazole", "levomepromazine") or intramuscular ("olanzapine", "aripiprazole" and "levomepromazine").

Cyamemazine carries a risk of arterial hypotension.

The "pre-therapeutic assessment" is based on the ECG whenever possible. In the case of major states of agitation, the ECG should be taken after administration, and the reasons for this should be recorded in the medical record.
