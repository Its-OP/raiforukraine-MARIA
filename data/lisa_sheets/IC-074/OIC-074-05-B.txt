The ''pre-therapeutic assessment'' prior to antipsychotic treatment includes a search for contraindications (ECG), any pregnancy, associated treatments and screening for metabolic disorders.

'''Rules for the proper use''' of antipsychotics :

* First-line molecules: second-generation antipsychotics;
* Choice of drug based on response to previous treatments, contraindications and patient preferences;
* Favour the drug with the fewest side effects;
* Do not combine two QT-prolonging drugs;
* Look for monotherapy and the minimum effective dose;
* In emergencies, reserve the intramuscular route for states of intense agitation and avoid dose escalation or repetition;
* Monitor clinical efficacy and adverse effects.
