==Indications==

===Psychotic disorders (particularly schizophrenia, the most classic indication)===

*Brief psychotic episode of any aetiology
*Schizoaffective disorder
*Schizophrenic disorder
*Persistent delusional disorder

===Mood disorders, but not for all products===

*Severe manic episode with or without psychotic symptoms
*Characterised depressive episode with psychotic symptoms
*Bipolar depressive episode (quetiapine only)

===Other indications not common to all===

*Short-term symptomatic treatment of anxiety in adults in the event of failure of standard sedative treatments such as cyamemazine.
*Behavioural disorders: agitation, psycho-behavioural symptoms of dementia (off-label, taking into account the risk/benefit balance).
*Refractory insomnia for sedative products such as alimemazine.

==Contra-indications==

===Absolute contraindications===
There is no ''absolute contraindication'' common to all antipsychotics, but there are specific contraindications for each drug:

*Known hypersensitivity to the compound
*QT prolongation; bradycardia < 65/minute and hypokalaemia
*Angle-closure glaucoma and risk of acute urine retention (for the more anticholinergic ones)
*A history of toxic agranulocytosis (phenothiazines, clozapine)
*In the event of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, extreme caution should be exercised when reintroducing an antipsychotic and the incriminating antipsychotic and long-acting antipsychotics should be contraindicated.

===Relatives===
There are "relative contraindications" requiring "precautions for use":

*Association with QT-prolonging or hypokalemic drugs
*Epilepsy
*Arrhythmias, angina, orthostatic hypotension
*Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (except clozapine)
*Cardiac, respiratory, hepatic or renal insufficiency
