- Local anaesthetics are widely used in dentistry, anaesthesiology, general medicine and many medical and surgical specialities.

- All local anaesthetics have a common molecular structure and a similar mode of action.

- They come in different forms (solutions, gels, plasters) and concentrations.

- There are two main classes of local anaesthetics:

- amides: in particular lidocaine, prilocaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine

- esters: in particular procaine and tetracaine.

- The molecules available differ in their :

- power

- time to act

- duration of action

- toxicity


Lidocaine (Xylocaine®) has a short onset of action (5 minutes) and a short duration of action (1 hour). It is the local anaesthetic most often used in everyday practice outside an anaesthetic environment. Lidocaine is available as a 1% (10 mg/ml) or 2% (20 mg/ml) solution.

EMLA is a eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine used for skin contact analgesia in children or adults, or genital mucosa analgesia in adults''.


'''<u>Indications</u>'''

- Cutaneous or mucosal contact analgesia for painful invasive procedures (venipuncture, lumbar puncture, fibroscopy, urethral catheterisation, etc.):

- Skin infiltration analgesia for minor surgical procedures (sutures, dermatology, etc.)

- '''Anaesthesia for locoregional analgesia''' (peripheral nerve blocks and central blocks such as spinal anaesthesia and epidural anaesthesia)

- '''Management of localised peripheral neuropathic pain, in the form of a lidocaine plaster''' (Versatis ®) as first-line treatment '''(neuropathic pain section, item 134) .''''

'''<u>Mechanisms</u>''''

- Action on nerve fibres by blocking sodium channels

- Blocking the entry of sodium into the nerve cell

- Blocking the propagation of the action potential

- Reversible blockage of nerve conduction


'''<u>Principles of use</u>''''

- '''Allow time for action'''

- '''For the transcutaneous route (patch), apply a thick layer of cream to the area to be treated at least 1 hour before the painful procedure, then cover it with a dressing'' and remove the cream with a compress after removing the dressing (the anaesthetic lasts for one to 2 hours).

- For infiltrations into the skin, leave to act for at least 5 minutes before carrying out the procedure.

- Lidocaine patches must be applied to healthy skin


'''<u>Adverse effects, toxicity and monitoring</u>''''

- The toxicity of local anaesthetics depends on the potency of the local anaesthetic used, its route of administration and the peak blood concentration.

- The adverse effects of topical local anaesthetics mainly involve a local reaction (redness, rarely itching or allergy).

- Cardiovascular and neurological toxicity can be extremely serious: it can be seen when the drug is accidentally passed into the bloodstream or when there is significant blood resorption after an overdose.

- The main signs of toxicity are :

- Visual disorders

- Metallic taste

- Ringing in the ears

- Yawning

- Speech difficulties

- Tingling around the lips

- There is an "antidote to local anaesthetic poisoning": 20% lipid emulsion (e.g. Intralipide 20%®). Intralipids act as chelators. They should be kept on the emergency trolley in departments using local anaesthetics (recovery room, emergency department, operating theatre).


'''<u>Precautions for use</u>''''

The precautions to be taken to avoid toxicity are :

- Slow injection

- Split injection

- Aspiration test before each injection

- Maximum dose of 5 mg/kg for lidocaine
