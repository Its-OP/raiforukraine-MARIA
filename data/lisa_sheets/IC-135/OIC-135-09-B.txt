- '''Antidepressants with analgesic properties include: tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine); serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (duloxetine, venlafaxine).''''

- Other antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors, etc.) have little or no analgesic effect.


'''<u>Indications</u>'''

- ''Peripheral or central neuropathic pain'' (high level of evidence)

- ''Basic treatment of migraine and tension headaches'' (amitriptyline, high level of evidence)

- Chronic osteoarticular pain and fibromyalgia (off-label) for duloxetine (low level of evidence)


'''<u>Mechanisms</u>''''

- Action on ''descending inhibitory controls'' via inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline

- Tricyclics also have anticholinergic and sodium channel blocking properties.

- Analgesic action ''independent of the effect on mood''.

- Some have anxiolytic properties (venlafaxine and clomipramine).


'''<u>Principles of use:</u>''''

- Start at low doses and increase in stages to reduce the risk of adverse effects (titration). When any antidepressant is initiated, inhibition may be overcome, with the risk of suicide.

- Genetic polymorphism (cytochrome P450 isoenzyme) contributes to individual variability in response and adverse effects.

- Need to be informed of the risk of driving, particularly during initiation.


'''<u>Adverse reactions and monitoring</u>''''

'''Tricyclic:''''

- '''Anticholinergic effects''' (dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, dysuria, cardiotoxic risks, sexual disorders, angle-closure glaucoma)

- Drowsiness and weight gain.

- Monitoring: cardiac (ECG on initiation), blood pressure (supine then standing), dysuria, particularly if multiple co-prescriptions, co-morbidities or doses ≥ 75 mg/d.

- In the elderly (>70 years), people with multiple medications or multiple co-morbidities, maintain moderate doses (<75 mg/day).

'''IRSNA (duloxetine, venlafaxine):'''

- Nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation and sexual problems.

- Rare cases of hypertension with high-dose venlafaxine (≥ 150mg/d).


'''<u>Counter indications</u>'''

Tricyclics: prostate adenoma, recent ischaemic heart disease and narrow-angle glaucoma, association with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)

- ISRNA: associations with MAOIs

- Relatives: caution with high doses of tramadol (increases the risk of epileptic seizures and serotonin syndrome).


'''<u>Drug interactions:</u>''''

- Association with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (absolute contraindication).

- Association with high-dose tramadol (risks: epilepsy, serotonin syndrome).

- Reduced efficacy of VKAs (duloxetine: CYP2D6 enzyme inducer).

'''<u>Main causes of failure:</u>''''

- Clinical: low doses (no titration) or adverse effects (rapid initiation).

- Genetic polymorphism (cytochrome P450 isoenzyme): contributes to individual variability in response and adverse effects
