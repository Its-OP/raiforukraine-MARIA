- Anti-epileptic drugs with analgesic properties include: '''gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin); sodium channel blockers: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine and topiramate'''

'''<u>Indications</u>''' (high level of evidence)

- '''Neuropathic pain: gabapentin, pregabalin'''

- '''Essential trigeminal neuralgia: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine''''

- '''Basic migraine treatment: topiramate'''

'''<u>Mechanisms</u>''''

- Gabapentin, pregabalin: binds to a subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Anxiolytic and sleep-inducing properties.

- Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate: voltage-dependent sodium channel blockers

- Topiramate: reduces glutamate release. Mood stabilising properties.


'''<u>Principles</u>''''

- Start with low doses and gradually increase them to reduce the risk of side effects.

- Inform patients of the risk of driving, particularly at the time of initiation.

'''<u>Adverse reactions and drug interactions</u>''''

'''Gapapentin, pregabalin:'''

- Drowsiness, dizziness

- Dose-related weight gain and peripheral oedema

- '''Misuse or abuse to be investigated before any prescription and at each renewal'''.

- Reduce doses if renal insufficiency.

- Recently reported increased risk of respiratory depression in association with opioids

- No pharmacological interactions


Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine

- Central effects: drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, diplopia (if high doses, signs of toxicity)

- Digestive effects: nausea, vomiting, dry mouth

- Cardiac effects: atrioventricular block (carbamazepine)

- Idiosyncratic effects: skin allergy, sometimes severe toxidermia (Stevens Johnson, Lyell), particularly in patients of Asian origin (HLA-B 1502), with a risk of cross-allergy between carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine in 30% of cases.

- Biological effects: hyponatremia, cytopenia, elevated transaminases

- '''Reduces the effect of oral contraceptives'' (enzyme inducing effect).

- Biological monitoring (liver function tests, platelet count and natraemia).

Topiramate

- Anorexia, paresthesias, drowsiness, confusion, asthenia

'''<u>Main contraindications</u>''''

- Severe renal impairment (gabapentin, pregabalin)

- Atrioventricular block (carbamazepine)

- Kidney stones (effect on carbonic anhydrase, topiramate)

- Pregnancy and breastfeeding

- Children under 6 (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine)

'''<u>Main causes of failure</u>''''

- Low doses (no titration) or adverse effects ++ if doses are increased rapidly.
