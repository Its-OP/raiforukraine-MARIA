Level II analgesics are weak opioids. Their analgesic effect is mediated by µ-opioid receptors (low affinity). They include: ''codeine, tramadol and opium powder.''


'''<u>Codeine</u>''''

- '''Converts to morphine in a small proportion'' after biotransformation by cytochrome CYP 2D6, but 5 to 10% of the Caucasian population does not have functional CYP 2D6 (codeine inactive after administration).

- Available in combination with paracetamol (codeine paracetamol), as a syrup in paediatrics or as dihydrocodeine.

- Corresponds to 1/6 morphine equivalent

'''<u>Tramadol</u>''''

- Synthetic opioid with a mixed central action.

- Tramadol and its main metabolite ''bind to μ-opioid receptors (partial agonist) and inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin'', hence its effectiveness in neuropathic pain.

- Available in sustained-release form (LP 12h or 24h), immediate-release form (1 dose every 4 to 6 hours) or combined with paracetamol to be taken every 4 to 6 hours.

- Maximum prescription period: three months

- Generally corresponds to 1/5 morphine equivalent (but there is no absolute consensus)

'''<u>Opium powder</u>''''

- Available in combination with paracetamol


'''<u>Indications and conditions of use:</u>'''

- '''Moderate to severe pain from the outset'''

- '''Neuropathic pain for tramadol (as a second-line treatment).'''

- Other weak o'''pioids are not recommended for neuropathic pain.  

- Weak opioids are best used for ''acute pain or chronic flare-up pain over a short period (a few months). Tramadol LP can be used over a longer period for neuropathic pain under supervision, but its maximum prescription duration is limited to three months.


'''<u>Undesirable effects:</u>''''

Other effects are common to strong opioids (see section on strong opioids); those associated with paracetamol (associations) are described in the section on paracetamol.

The undesirable effects specific to tramadol (due to its monoamine reuptake properties) are :

- Nausea, vomiting (particularly in slow metaboliser patients): most frequent

- Dry mouth

- Abdominal pain

- Visual disorders

- Convulsions (especially if contributing factors)

- Serotonin syndrome in combination with serotonergic treatments

- Mental confusion, particularly in the elderly

  



  

<u>''Specific contraindications''</u> (see strong opioids section for common ICs)

- '''Respiratory insufficiency, severe asthma'''

- Breastfeeding

- '''Children under 12 for codeine'''

- '''Child under 3 for tramadol'''

- '''Uncontrolled epilepsy (tramadol)'''

- Association with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (tramadol)


<u>''Dependence, tolerance, misuse''</u> (see strong opioids section)

Weak opioids and tramadol have a risk of physical and psychological dependence and misuse similar to that of strong opioids'' : especially if high doses, LI forms.
