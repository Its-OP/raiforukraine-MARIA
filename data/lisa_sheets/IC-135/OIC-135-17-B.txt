'''<u>Definitions and principles</u>''''

- Therapeutic education ''is an integral part of the management of chronic pain patients''.

- Its aim is to improve patients' quality of life through the acquisition of knowledge skills ("knowing how to be" and "knowing how to do").

- It is based on drawing up a shared educational assessment with the patient and setting objectives according to the specific needs expressed by the patient.

- It covers ''all chronic pain conditions''.

'''<u>Facilitating the right analgesia </u>''''

- Therapeutic education requires a number of exchanges with the patient: an initial shared educational assessment, followed by follow-up until the objectives have been achieved.

- '''Personalised, realistic, assessable educational objectives, adapted to the patient's fears and beliefs'' on analgesic treatment

- '''These objectives are:'''

- Reduced pain

- Managing acute attacks of pain

- Prevention and management of undesirable effects of treatment

- Improving, restoring or maintaining a function


'''<u>Self-care and analgesic adaptation skills for the patient:</u>'''


'''Knowledge of treatments'''

- Expected benefits and possible side effects :


'''Knowledge of how to take and stop them'''

- Compliance with doses,

- Start at low doses and gradually increase until the equilibrium dose is reached (efficacy/tolerance).

- Soft stop in case of interruption

- Ability to assess whether or not it is worth continuing treatment, depending on the efficacy and progress of the pain

- Acquiring safety skills: anticipating the side effects of different analgesic treatments (e.g. staying well hydrated, taking a laxative if taking strong opioids, taking NSAIDs in the middle of meals).


'''Competence in the implementation''' '''of associated non-medicinal measures for analgesic purposes'''

- Re-education including self-education

- Non-drug analgesic techniques (such as CBT, hypnosis and relaxation)

- Physical activity

'''<u>Main causes of failure</u>''''

- Failure to listen to the patient's specific needs

- Failure to take account of the patient's fears and beliefs

- Lack of patient motivation

- Lack of monitoring and evaluation of results
