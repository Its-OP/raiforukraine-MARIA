'''<u>Mechanisms of action</u>'''

- An antispasmodic is a pharmacological substance that can relax the body's smooth muscles and prevent or combat spasms.

- This antispasmodic - or spasmolytic - effect is exerted on the smooth muscle fibres of the digestive tract, the urinary tract and the gynaecological tract through different modes of action.


'''<u>Anticholinergics</u>''''

- Muscarinic receptor antagonists, which lead to synaptic depletion of acetylcholine, itself responsible for reducing muscle contractility: atropine and synthetic atropinics (scopolamine butylbromide, butylhyoscine, butylscopolaminediph√©manil, mepenzolate, pipenzolate, propantheline).


'''<u>The musculotropics</u>''''

- Papaverine derivatives: inhibit the synaptic release of excitatory mediators such as acetylcholine, substance P and histamine, synthetic papaverines (''mebeverine'').

- '''Calcium channel blockers''': act by reducing the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle fibre and reducing the possibility of contraction ('''pinaverium bromide''', otilonium).

- '''Opioid receptor agonists''': enkephalinergics ('''trimebutine'').

- Mixed-action antispasmodics: numerous synthetic products (dihexyverine, phloroglucinol, propyromazine, tiemonium).

- The most common formulation is oral, but there are also injectable forms and, more rarely, local (rectal) forms.

- They are sometimes combined with other drugs such as psycholeptics (combination of the benzodiazepine '''''chlordiazepoxide''''' with an anticholinergic '''''clinidium bromide''''').


'''<u>Indications</u>'''

'''Treatment in an acute situation:'''

- '''Symptomatic treatment of painful digestive spasmodic manifestations'''

(functional disorders, meteorism)

- '''Symptomatic treatment of painful spasmodic manifestations of the bile ducts'''

- '''Treatment of intestinal obstruction in palliative care'''

- '''Symptomatic treatment of painful gynaecological spasmodic symptoms'''

- Symptomatic treatment of renal colic pain


'''Treatment in a chronic situation:'''

- Irritable bowel syndrome pain


'''<u>Contraindications</u>''''

- For all: known allergies

- For anticholinergics: angle-closure glaucoma and risk of urinary retention linked to urethro-prostatic disorders (prostate adenoma).

'''<u>Undesirable effects</u>''''

- For anticholinergics: dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, glaucoma attacks, mydriasis, blurred vision, tachycardia, palpitations and allergic reactions.

- Musculotropics: rare epigastralgia and allergic reactions


'''<u>Interactions</u>''''

- For anticholinergics: addition of atropine side-effects (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention) if combined with other substances with an anticholinergic effect: imipraminic antidepressants, phenothiazine neuroleptics, for example.


'''<u>Surveillance methods</u>''''

- Effectiveness monitoring: assessment of pain intensity and frequency of painful attacks; tolerance monitoring: assessment of side effects.


'''<u>Main causes of failure</u>''''

- Pathophysiological mechanisms of pain not targeted by the chosen treatment, insufficient dosage.
