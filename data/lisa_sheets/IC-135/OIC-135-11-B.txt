'''<u>Modalities of action:</u>'''

- Muscle relaxants relax striated skeletal muscles. They may be indicated when a contracture complicates another morbid cause (traumatology).

- They can be subdivided into 2 groups: benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines.


'''<u>Indications:</u>'''

- Tetrazepam was the only benzodiazepine with a marketing authorisation for muscle contractures, which was withdrawn in 2013.

- Thiocolchicoside (a colchicine derivative) has marketing authorisation for the adjunctive treatment of painful muscular contractures in rheumatology. Treatment is limited to 7 days.

- No muscle relaxants are recommended for acute low back pain.


'''<u>Contraindications:</u>'''

- Thiocolchicoside is teratogenic and is contraindicated in pregnant and breastfeeding women and women of childbearing age without contraception.

- Benzodiazepines are contraindicated in cases of severe respiratory insufficiency, sleep apnoea, hepatic insufficiency, myasthenia gravis, etc.

'''<u>Adverse reactions and drug interactions:</u>''''

- The most common side effect of thiocolchicoside is diarrhoea. Liver damage and drowsiness have also been reported.

- Benzodiazepines have numerous side effects (drowsiness, respiratory depression) and have an unfavourable benefit-risk balance in the treatment of muscle contractures. Side effects may be exacerbated by concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, particularly opioids and alcohol.
