Level 1 analgesics (WHO reference 1986) correspond to the historical non-opioid analgesics: ''paracetamol, nefopam, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.''

=Paracetamol=
- First-line analgesic alone or in combination; the most widely administered analgesic in the world.

- Reference antipyretic, although not very effective (maximum -0.5Â°C)

- Available in oral, injectable or rectal form; from birth

- Mode of action unclear (effect on serotonergic controls and probably on calcium channels); no anti-inflammatory effect

- Onset of action: 1 hour, duration of action: 6 hours


'''Efficiency '''

- Mild acute or chronic pain, except neuropathic (ineffective)

- Moderate to severe pain in combination with opioids and other non-opioid analgesics

'''Undesirable effects, risks:'''

- '''Hepatotoxicity''' : '''exceptional under normal conditions of use.'''

- Linked to depletion of the liver's glutathione reserves. Risk factors: regular overdosing, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, severe renal failure, weight < 50kg, low glutathione reserves, etc.

- In the event of massive overdose: fulminant hepatitis leading to death, associated with acute tubular necrosis and rhabdomyolysis

- Management of an overdose: measurement of paracetamol levels + administration of N-acetyl-cysteine (specific antidote). In the event of fulminant hepatitis, transfer to a referral centre to consider liver transplantation as part of a "super-emergency".

- Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis: exceptional

- Renal toxicity and thrombocytopenia if overdosed

- If paracetamol is used as a treatment for headache attacks, it is possible to develop chronic daily headaches as a result of drug abuse if it is taken for more than 15 days a month.

=Nefopam=
- Non-opioid analgesic with a central action (inhibition of mono-amine reuptake), with no anti-inflammatory or anti-pyretic action. Probable anti-hyperalgesic effects.

- Only available by injection (oral administration not covered by the MA).

- Dosage: 20 mg per dose, repeated 4 to 6 times a day, not to exceed 120 mg/24h. IVSE administration is possible to improve tolerance.


'''Efficiency'''

- Post-operative analgesia in combination with other opioid or non-opioid analgesics.

- Analgesic potency at least comparable to weak opioids (codeine, tramadol, opium powder).


'''Most frequent adverse reactions, risks:'''

- Probable anticholinergic effects: tachycardia, urinary retention, acute glaucoma, confusion

- Nausea and vomiting

- Drowsiness

- Convulsions (lowering of the epileptogenic threshold)

- Malaise with flushing if the drug is administered rapidly


'''Contraindications:'''

- Children (aged < 15), pregnant women

- Epilepsy

- High risk of urinary retention or acute glaucoma due to angle closure

- Elderly subjects (aged 75 and over): relative contraindication due to probable anticholinergic effects
