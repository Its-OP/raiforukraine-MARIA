Most poisoning in children is benign. All medicines, household products, cosmetics or plants carry a potential risk for children, whatever their age. However, the younger the child, the more quickly the toxic dose of a substance can be reached.

The assessment of the degree of urgency will be based on the toxic agent involved, the terrain and the patient's clinical condition (existence of respiratory, haemodynamic and/or neurological failure).
