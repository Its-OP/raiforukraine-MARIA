'''Evaluating the dietary profile:'''

- Distribution of daily food intake, number of meals

- Consumption of fruit, vegetables and bread

- Cooking (frying) and seasoning methods

- Consumption of sugary and alcoholic drinks

- if necessary, food diary


'''Analysing eating behaviour''' :

- Speed of food ingestion: tachyphagia if Â³ 7 on analogue scale to quantify speed of ingestion (1: slowest; 10: fastest); average duration of meals (<20 min).

- Volume ingested at mealtimes, tendency to refill

- Stopping meals beyond satiation (absence of satiety): feeling of tension, heaviness or gastric pain at the end of the meal

- Cognitive restriction

- Extra-prandial binge eating (impulsivity, frequency, timing, context of onset): see item 71 TCAs

- nibbling: quietly eating small quantities of "pleasure" foods,

- compulsions ('cravings'): irrepressible urges to eat without losing control during the act (choice of pleasant foods eaten without frenzy and in limited quantities)

- binge eating: irrepressible cravings for food with loss of control during the act (greedy consumption of food and/or consumption of large quantities and/or failure to select pleasant foods),

- bulimic hyperphagia: at least one binge per week for at least 3 months

- bulimia (rarer in obesity) associated with purging manoeuvres
