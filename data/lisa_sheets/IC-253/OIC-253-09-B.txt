The factors favouring a rebound in early adiposity are closely linked to the first 1000 days of life (from conception to the child's 2nd birthday):

- Family history,

- Events that occurred during the mother's intrauterine life (smoking, poorly controlled diabetes, excessive weight gain, unbalanced diet).

- Excessive or defective foetal growth (macrosomia/hypotrophy) and accelerated weight gain in the first 2 years of life, even if the birth weight is normal.

- Factors at play during the first few months of life: breastfeeding, inappropriate educational attitudes on the part of family and friends, etc.


Other factors favouring excess weight, common to adults:

- Parents' socio-economic difficulties and unfavourable living environment

- Lack of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle

- Lack of sleep

- Excessive consumption of sugary products (drinks and biscuits)

- Psychopathological factors

- Physical or sexual abuse or neglect in childhood or adolescence [[Maltreatment and children at risk: sexual abuse: how to make the diagnosis 2C-057-ET-A02]]


Genetic obesity (rare) should be suspected when :

- Early and severe obesity

- Associated with malformation and dysmorphic syndrome, developmental delay, learning difficulties and intellectual disability, sensory anomalies (syndromic obesity).

- Endocrine abnormalities
