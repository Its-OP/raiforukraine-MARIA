'''Eléments qui doivent faire évoquer une obésité secondaire :'''

* treatments that encourage weight gain: neuroleptics, lithium, anti-epileptics, glucocorticoids, hormonal treatments (e.g. progestogens), anti-allergic drugs, etc.

* Hypothyroidism (moderate weight gain; not a cause of obesity)

* hypercortisolism (facial-truncular obesity and signs of hypercatabolism (purple stretch marks, amyotrophy of the roots of the limbs)) due to adrenal tumour (ACTH independent) or pituitary adenoma (ACTH dependent) (see item [[Pituitary adenoma]])

* a brain tumour with hypothalamic involvement (e.g. craniopharyngioma)


'''Complementary examinations to be carried out in cases of suspected secondary obesity'''

Depending on clinical orientation and not systematically:

- thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): search for hypothyroidism

- 24-hour urine free cortisol (UFC), minute dexamethasone braking: look for hypercorticism

- pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (to look for pituitary and hypothalamic pathologies) and pituitary hormone assessment
