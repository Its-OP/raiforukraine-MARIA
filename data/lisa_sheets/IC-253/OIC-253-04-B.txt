-Corpulence (assessed by BMI) increases up to the age of 1 year, then decreases until around the age of 6, after which it increases again, corresponding to the rebound of adiposity.

-If the rebound in adiposity occurs before the age of 5, it is said to be early, suggesting that the child is predisposed to excess weight.

-Three types of curve kinetics can be seen in an obese child (see Figure 1):

1) absence of rebound adiposity (potentially serious form) ;

2) early adiposity rebound around age 3 (common form);

3) lane crossing after the age of physiological rebound, (rarer, eliminate secondary obesity)
