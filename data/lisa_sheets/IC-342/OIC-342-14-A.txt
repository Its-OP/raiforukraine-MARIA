Clinical elements justifying a cardiological opinion within 24 hours:

* loss of consciousness during physical effort
* recent or unexplained dyspnoea
* heart failure
* family history of sudden cardiac death in people aged < 40 or known family heart disease
* heart murmur
* any significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality (detailed below)

Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities requiring a cardiological opinion within 24 hours:

* sustained atrial arrhythmia,
* persistent inappropriate bradycardia (''SDD-159 bradycardia''),
* conduction abnormality: complete right bundle branch block, left bundle branch block, atrioventricular block of any degree
* right or left ventricular hypertrophy,
* long QT interval (corrected > 450 ms),
* short QT interval (corrected < 350 ms),
* pathological Q wave,
* ventricular pre-excitation
* any ventricular arrhythmia (including ventricular extrasystoles),
* Brugada syndrome,
* entrained cardiac rhythm (pacemaker),
* any ST segment or T wave abnormality.

Clinical elements justifying a neurological opinion within 2 weeks:

* tongue biting
* deviation of the head when unconscious
* no memory of abnormal behaviour, although abnormal behaviour was observed before, during or after the loss of consciousness
* unusual posture
* limb movements
* confusion after brief loss of consciousness
* prodromal symptoms such as a feeling of déjà vu or never having seen anything before or any other symptom suggestive of a focal onset

NB: in the event of prodromal symptoms such as a feeling of déjà vu or never having seen anything before, or any other symptom suggestive of a focal onset, brain imaging ('''[[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SDD-226]]''') must be carried out as a matter of urgency and a neurological opinion sought as a matter of urgency in the event of an abnormality.

Clinical elements justifying an emergency resuscitation opinion:

* persistent coma
* status epilepticus
* state of shock
* rhythmic storms
* failure of one or more vital organs, requiring the use of an artificial support technique (circulatory assistance, respiratory assistance, extra-renal purification)
