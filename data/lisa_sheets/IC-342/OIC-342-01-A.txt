Malaise ('''[[Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050]]'''): vague feeling of unease or disturbance of physiological functions: this is not a medical term but a complaint or a reason for seeking care.

Syncope (''[[Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050]]''):

* clinical manifestation secondary to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, spontaneously resolving
* brief, spontaneous loss of consciousness, with amnesia and loss of postural tone
* rapid return to a normal state of consciousness: normal neurological examination in the aftermath: consciousness is usually regained at the scene of the event before help arrives
* with or without prodromal symptoms (cookie-cutter syncope)
* sometimes associated with myoclonus which begins after loss of consciousness
Lipothymia (''[[Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050]]''):

* clinical manifestation with the same mechanism as syncope, but the duration of cerebral hypoperfusion is too short to cause complete loss of consciousness
* imminent sensation of syncope without loss of consciousness: prodromes without syncope

Comitial or epileptic seizure ('''[[Convulsion SDD-120]], [[Coma and consciousness disorders SDD-028]], [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050]]'''):

* clinical manifestation linked to the synchronous paroxysmal hyperactivity of cortical neurons and to the propagation of this activity
* only generalised seizures cause loss of consciousness:
** absence with loss of consciousness lasting a few tens of seconds
** generalised tonic-clonic seizure with prolonged loss of consciousness lasting ten to several tens of minutes, including the seizure itself and the post-critical confusion phase
* usually gradual regaining of consciousness in the emergency vehicle or at the emergency room

Etat de mal Ã©pileptique (''''[[Convulsion SDD-120]], [[Coma and disturbed consciousness SDD-028]], [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SDD-050]]'''): epileptic seizures that persist long enough or recur at short enough intervals to create a stable and lasting epileptic condition.
