* a fall of > 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure (SBP) within 1 to 3 minutes of becoming orthostatic,
* or a fall of > 10 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) within 1 to 3 minutes of becoming orthostatic,
* or systolic blood pressure (SBP) â‰¤ 90 mmHg reproducing spontaneous symptoms within 1 to 3 minutes of transition to orthostatism.

Diagnosis of hypoglycaemia ('''[[Convulsion SDD-120]], [[Coma and disturbed consciousness SDD-028]], [[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209]]'''): simultaneous finding (Whipple's triad)::

* signs of neuroglucopenia: manifestation of focal or generalised dysfunction of the nervous system
* low venous glycaemia (<0.5 g/l in non-diabetics - <0.60 g/l in diabetics)
* and the rapid correction (10-15 min) of symptoms when blood sugar levels return to normal.

Systematic testing of blood glucose levels in any patient with any degree of consciousness impairment.
