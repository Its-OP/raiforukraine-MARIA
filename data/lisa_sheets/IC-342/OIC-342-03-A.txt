Objectives:

* distinguish a syncope/lipothymia from a generalised epileptic seizure: the main diagnostic criterion is the duration of the loss of consciousness
* identify the factors that will help in making an aetiological diagnosis

The importance of detailed questioning of the patient and/or one or more witnesses:

* characterise the malaise or loss of consciousness:
** confirmation of loss of consciousness
** duration of loss of consciousness
** search for prodromes
** circumstances of onset: search for triggering factor(s)
** onset of abnormal movements, type of abnormal movements, and timing of their onset in relation to the loss of consciousness (simultaneous or delayed).
* look for elements that may help with the aetiological diagnosis:
** if the patient has a pacemaker or a mechanical valve prosthesis
** history of a disease causing dysautonomia
** history of cardiovascular risk factors
** family history of heart disease and/or sudden death
** personal history of primary or secondary cardiomyopathy (whatever the cause)
** personal history of seizures and/or epilepsy
** usual treatment: compliance, recent change in treatment
** psychiatric history and/or history of taking toxic substances (narcotics, alcohol, psychotropic drugs)
** look for associated signs: chest pain, body aches

Clinical examination:

* look for elements to guide the aetiological diagnosis:
** vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure when lying and standing
** cardiovascular examination: irregular pulse, heart murmur, signs of heart failure
** neurological examination: state of consciousness, signs of deficits
** loss of urine, tongue biting
* look for traumatic lesions secondary to loss of consciousness and/or abnormal movements
