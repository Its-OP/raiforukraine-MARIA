Complications associated with MAP are very rare.

*Complications associated with ovarian stimulation:
**The ''allergic risk'' (linked to taking medication): exceptional risk.
**Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome": main risk, of variable severity. It is linked to an excessive ovarian response to stimulation with pelvic pain accompanied by bloating. This leads to the creation of a 3rd sector with ascites or even pleural effusion, associated with weight gain of varying degrees. In severe forms, it can be life-threatening, requiring hospitalisation in intensive care. The main complication of this syndrome is the risk of arterial or venous thromboembolism, with phlebitis or pulmonary embolism of multifactorial origin, suspected in the presence of chest pain or dyspnoea following puncture. Thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) should be instituted in cases of proven ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If a pregnancy occurs during oocyte puncture, this thromboprophylaxis will usually be maintained during the 1st trimester of pregnancy.
**Adnexal torsion'': an exceptional risk. It is linked to an increase in ovarian volume during ovarian stimulation, suspected in the presence of sudden, acute, lateral pelvic pain associated with pelvic defence. This is a surgical emergency.

*Complications associated with ovarian puncture:
**The risks associated with ''anaesthesia'' are common to all types of anaesthesia, local, sedation or general depending on the situation.
**Risks associated with "ovarian puncture" are extremely rare (haemoperitoneum, pelvic infections including tubo-ovarian abscesses), intestinal or urinary tract lesions.

*Complications related to the evolution of the pregnancy obtained:
**The complications of the onset of pregnancy by MAP are the same as for a spontaneous pregnancy (risk of spontaneous miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy), the monitoring of the pregnancy is identical to that of a natural pregnancy.
**The ''risk of gravid venous thromboembolism'' is slightly greater when a pregnancy occurs immediately after IVF-c or ICSI, compared with spontaneous pregnancies or pregnancies after IUI.  
**Multiple pregnancies" are slightly more frequent, depending on the number of embryos transferred (1 or 2) and the multi-follicular response to stimulation in the case of IUI. The risk of prematurity, caesarean section, low birth weight and perinatal death is increased compared with a single pregnancy.

*Long-term complications of MAP:
**Risks inherent in the '''transmission of a possible genetic abnormality'' male or female responsible for infertility.
**Potential excess risk of certain ''congenital malformations'' (musculoskeletal, cardiac, urogenital, etc.) and even cancer in the child in the case of IVF-c or ICSI techniques. However, these complications remain very rare in terms of frequency. In the current state of knowledge, the question of whether this risk is linked to the procedures used in MAP or whether it is linked to the intrinsic biological factors associated with the couple's infertility remains unresolved.
**The data concerning the carcinological risks of patients undergoing MAP are very reassuring.
