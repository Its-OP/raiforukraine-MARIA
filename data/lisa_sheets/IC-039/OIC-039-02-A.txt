Fertility preservation refers to the clinical and biological practices that enable any ''person whose medical care is likely to impair fertility, or whose fertility is in danger of being prematurely impaired, to benefit from the collection and preservation of his gametes or germ tissue,'' with a view to the subsequent provision, for his benefit, of medically assisted procreation, or with a view to the preservation and restoration of his fertility.

Since the Bioethics Act of 2021, it has been possible to have a gamete frozen to preserve fertility, in the absence of a medical indication.
