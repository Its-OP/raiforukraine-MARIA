<u>''Since the bioethics law of August 2021, a PGM technique can be performed''</u>:

*for a couple made up of a living man and woman, or for a couple made up of two women, or for an unmarried woman.
**according to the "age criteria" mentioned below:
***Gamete retrieval for the purposes of MAP (IVF/ICSI):
****until the woman's 43rd birthday
****until the spouse's 60th birthday)
***IUI, use of gametes or germ tissue for reproductive purposes and embryo transfer may be carried out:
****until the 45th birthday of the woman who is to carry the child
****until the 60th birthday of the member of the couple who is not intended to carry the child
**and who have "consented" to the embryo transfer or insemination beforehand (a consent form must be signed by both members of the couple or the unmarried woman).


Gametes can be stored for non-medical reasons:

* For women: from age 29 and before age 37
* For men: from age 29 and before age 45


The costs covered by the Assurance Maladie include :

*Medical exploration of fertility
*Treatments prescribed during the course of MAP treatment
*6 IUI attempts
*4 IVF-c or ICSI attempts (an attempt includes stimulation, obtaining and in vitro culture of the embryos, transfer of the embryo(s) obtained immediately after puncture or after freezing and thawing).

In the event of a pregnancy following an MPA technique, the number of attempts (IUI and IVF+/-ICSI) is reset to zero for the Assurance Maladie if the couple or unmarried woman wishes to have a new child using MPA.

It is necessary for the couple or the unmarried woman to use all the frozen embryos before making any further attempts.

Every year, couples or unmarried women with retained embryos are consulted as to whether they wish to continue with their parental project. If the couple separates, or if they do not wish to continue with their parental project, they may request that the embryos be destroyed, or that they be transferred to research or to another couple.

<Gamete or embryo donation </u> is carried out in a public or not-for-profit establishment authorised for these activities, mainly in an egg and sperm study and conservation centre (CECOS). This involves the intervention of a third-party donor of spermatozoa or oocytes or a donation of embryos with a view to their reception (preserved as part of IVF-c or ICSI, for which there is no longer a parental project). The couple benefiting from a gamete or embryo donation is referred to as the "recipient couple".

The conditions for access to third-party donor MPA are identical to those for intraconjugal MPA.

The main principles of the donation are as follows:

*Voluntary'': donation is carried out freely, after the donor has signed a written consent form with the medical team authorised to carry out the donation, and the recipient couple has signed it with a notary.
*Free of charge'': no payment in return, but expenses incurred by the donation are covered.
*Anonymity: donors and recipients do not have access to their respective identities. Since the Bioethics Act of 2021, children born from a donation will have the right, when they come of age, to request, if they wish, the identifying and non-identifying data of the donor (sperm, oocytes, embryos).

The number of children born from the same donor is limited to 10.

Donors may be single or a couple.

Donors are not required to have had children prior to donation.

<u>'''Concerning fertility preservation'''</u>, the '''consent''' of the patient or of the holder of parental authority if the patient is a minor is obtained prior to the gametes or germ tissue being preserved. The consent of both members of the couple is obtained if embryo conservation is envisaged. Every year, he/she is asked whether he/she wishes to continue or stop gamete or germ tissue preservation.  All fertility preservation techniques are currently reimbursed at 100% by the French Assurance Maladie, in accordance with the conditions set out above.


It should be noted that MAP treatment and recourse to fertility preservation are carried out after "multidisciplinary consultation" between the doctors and reproductive biologists of the MAP centre carrying out the procedure.
