The main medical indications for female fertility preservation are

*Gonadotoxic treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery), used in the ''treatment'' of ''cancer'' and which can alter the stock of primordial follicles:
**Haematological diseases (leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma)
**Breast cancer
**Other cancers
*Gonadotoxic treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery), used in the "treatment of non-cancerous pathologies" and which may alter the stock of primordial follicles:
**Non-malignant haematological diseases requiring chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.
**Systemic diseases requiring chemotherapy
**Ovarian diseases: bilateral benign ovarian tumours, severe or recurrent ovarian endometriosis, diseases at risk of ovarian torsion, etc.
*Conditions at risk of premature ovarian failure: high-risk genetic anomalies (e.g. Turner syndrome, FMR1 gene pre-mutation).


The main medical indications for male fertility preservation are

*in pubescent adolescents and adult men
**chemotherapy or any drug treatment which may destroy spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) or alter the sperm genome.
**radiotherapy, which can have the same toxic effect on germ stem cells and sperm as chemotherapy if the irradiation field is close to or directly on the testicles
**testicular surgery (e.g. testicular cancer, benign testicular tumour, testicular torsion)
**surgery to the spermatic excretory tract, including vasectomy
**any surgery that may result in irreversible dysfunction of erection and ejaculation (anejaculation or retrograde ejaculation) (e.g. radical prostatectomy, bladder neck surgery)
**congenital anomalies of the testicle, most often genetic in origin, responsible for sperm damage which may worsen over time and lead to non-obstructive azoospermia (severe oligozoospermia, Klinefelter's syndrome, AZF microdeletion of the Y chromosome, etc.).

*In prepubertal boys, most testicular tissue is preserved prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants in the cancer field for acute leukaemia, or outside the cancer field for non-malignant haematological diseases (sickle cell anaemia, medullary aplasia, etc.), or even prior to HSC autografts for lymphomas or central nervous system tumours.
