Medically Assisted Procreation (MAP) refers to the clinical and biological practices involved in in vitro conception, embryo transfer and artificial insemination, as well as the use of fertility preservation techniques (gamete and germ tissue preservation).

AMP is used, among other things, to remedy a couple's infertility ([[Difficultés à procréer SD-033|Difficultés à procréer]]) or to prevent the transmission of a particularly serious disease to the child or a member of the couple.

Since the 2021 revision of the Bioethics Act, MAP has been accessible to any couple consisting of a man and a woman, or two women, or any unmarried woman.
