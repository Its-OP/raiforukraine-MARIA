The main indications for recourse to MAP include :

*reproductive pathologies (see LISA 38) ''It should be noted that infertility may turn out to be unexplained (idiopathic) at the time of the work-up, and will nevertheless be managed by MAP''.
*the risk of ''transmission of a particularly serious genetic pathology'' (recourse to pre-implantation diagnosis will then be proposed)
*the risk of "transmitting a viral pathology" (to avoid transmitting a viral disease to the other member of the couple, mainly HIV)
*the fulfilment of a ''parental project'' of a female couple or an unmarried woman
*fertility preservation (medical or non-medical indications)".
