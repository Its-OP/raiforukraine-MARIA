Depending on the person's level of disability, a legal protection measure can be put in place to help the person carry out the acts of their civil life.

With curatorship, the person is assisted in these acts.

With guardianship, the person is represented in these acts.

A safeguard of justice measure can be put in place for temporary and rapid protection, or while waiting for a curatorship or guardianship to be put in place.
