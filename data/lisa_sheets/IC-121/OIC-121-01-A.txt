When a psychiatric disorder leads to an alteration in cognitive abilities or cognitive biases, and these interfere with social relations or daily activities, we speak of a "situation of psychic disability", or for short of "follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression) SD-269|psychic disability]".

Psychiatric disability differs from intellectual disability in that it is not present from birth, is progressive and requires medical care.

Intellectual disability: linked to an intellectual impairment

Psychological disability: linked to a psychiatric disorder

There are three levels of disability

- Impairment: is the consequence of cognitive or motivational impairment

- Activity limitations: these are the consequence of the disability and concern the difficulty of carrying out an activity.

- Restrictions on participation refer to activities or roles that the person is unable to carry out because of their disability, but also because of their environment or society.
