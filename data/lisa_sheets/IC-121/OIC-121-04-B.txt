Psychosocial rehabilitation covers interventions that enable people to guarantee or improve access to a social and civic life.

Various social measures exist to facilitate access to housing, work, financial aid and social life.

'''Housing'''

Depending on the patient's level of autonomy and the availability of existing aids, they may be able to live independently in their own home (or even with their family) without needing any assistance.

Housing assistance can take the form of

- therapeutic or community flats,

- social support services (SAVS) or medical-social support services for disabled adults (SAMSAH),

- home visits and/or household help

- collective accommodation establishments (foyers de vie, foyers d'accueil spécialisés, foyers d'accueil médicalisé) when independent housing is not possible

'''Work'''

If work in an ordinary environment is possible, recognition as a disabled worker (RQTH) may be offered.

If it is not possible to work in an ordinary environment, sheltered employment may be offered: establishment and service d'aide par le travail, adapted company.

If employment is not possible, an allowance for disabled adults (AAH) or an invalidity pension (if the patient has already worked) may be claimed.

'''Social life'''

Mutual aid groups (GEMs) aim to combat the isolation of people with psychiatric disorders. They are self-managed and funded by the ARS.

The participation of users in various commissions and public bodies is increasingly encouraged.

The aim of peer support is to enable people with personal experience of psychiatric disorders to support the recovery process of other people with psychiatric disorders, including in hospital settings.
