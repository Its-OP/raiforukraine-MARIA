In cases of bilateral laryngeal immobility in the closed position, dyspnoea is often in the foreground. This is a major diagnostic and therapeutic emergency because the prognosis is vital.

An aetiological assessment must be carried out at the same time as treatment. In most cases, a temporary tracheostomy is indicated.

In the case of bilateral laryngeal immobility on opening, dysphonia is very significant, with an almost inaudible voice. There is a significant risk of false routes to liquids.
