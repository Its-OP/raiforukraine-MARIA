Unilateral laryngeal paralysis causes different dysphonia depending on the position of the vocal cord:

- open position: very weak voice, often muffled;

- closed position: very discreet or even absent semiology ;

The diagnosis is confirmed on nasofibroscopy, with one of the vocal cords remaining immobile.

Bilateral laryngeal paralysis produces different symptoms depending on the position of the vocal cords:

- open position: severe dysphonia with an almost inaudible voice;

- closed position: dyspnoea in the foreground: life-threatening emergency;
