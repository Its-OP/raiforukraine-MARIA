Any persistent dysphonia should be examined during an ENT consultation with nasopharyngeal fibroscopy.

The aim of this examination is to look for laryngeal cancer, particularly in subjects at risk.

In the case of any persistent dysphonia, it is essential to carry out an examination of the vocal cords during the ENT consultation.

The examination must include :

- search for cancer risk factors: age, "vocal risk" profession (such as teachers), sex, alcohol, smoking, gastro-oesophageal reflux, history of surgery or trauma;

- look for associated signs: dyspnoea, dysphagia, false routes ;

- Examination of the cranial pairs, in particular: lingual motor function (XII), motor function of the soft palate (X), and of the posterior pharyngeal wall (IX and X: "curtain sign");

- examination of the cervical areas and thyroid gland.
