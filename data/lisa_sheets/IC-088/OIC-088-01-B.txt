The larynx has 3 functions:

- Phonation (vibration of the vocal folds or vocal cords)

- Swallowing and protection of the lower airways (swallowing closure, coughing)

- Ventilation (opening during inspiration)

The larynx is made up of :

- vocal cords. When open, they allow air to pass through; when closed, they block food from reaching the oesophagus. In the closed position, with controlled exhalation, they vibrate and create the voice.

- a cartilaginous framework (cricoid "ring", thyroid "shield")

- a set of muscles that ensure closure and opening. The largest of these muscles are located in two symmetrical paired structures: the vocal cords


The mobility of the vocal cords is controlled by the inferior laryngeal nerve (recurrent), a collateral branch of the X (vagus or pneumogastric nerve).

Its nucleus is located in the medulla oblongata, close to the IX (glossopharyngeal) and XII (hypoglossal) nuclei. These three nerves are involved in swallowing. The X runs down into the neck, close to the carotid artery. The recurrent nerve "ascends" towards the larynx after originating below the aortic arch on the left and at the base of the neck on the right. In its ascending course, the recurrent nerve is attached to the deep surface of the thyroid gland and to the cervical oesophagus.
