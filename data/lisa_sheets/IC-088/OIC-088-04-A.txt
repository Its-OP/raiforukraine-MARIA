Dysphonia is a voice disorder, more specifically an abnormality in the vibration of the vocal cords.

Not all speech abnormalities are dysphonia. A distinction is made between :

*Weak voices in patients with respiratory insufficiency or in patients whose general condition is severely impaired;
*voice abnormalities related to nasal obstruction (closed rhinolalia) or air leakage through the nasal turbinates (open rhinolalia);
*voice timbre abnormalities caused by a basilingual or oropharyngeal tumour ("pharyngeal" voice);
*dysarthria, in the context of neurological diseases (Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
