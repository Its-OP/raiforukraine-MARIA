Immobility is not synonymous with paralysis: a mechanical or tumoral blockage is possible.

The differential diagnosis is not always easy (questioning, examination and sometimes LES).

Causes of mechanical blockages :

- cancer of the larynx or piriform sinus. This is important because TNM status classifies unilateral laryngeal immobility as T3,

- post-traumatic lesions (after intubation): dysphonia occurring on awakening from surgery or emergency intubation. On examination, the arytenoid may be inflamed or even dislocated.


Causes of paralysis :

- malignant lesion in the nerve pathway. A cervico-thoracic CT scan with injection is essential. We will look for :

o thyroid cancer,

o lung cancer: mainly on the left because of the course of the vagus nerve (X), but possible on both sides because of mediastinal invasion,

o oesophageal cancer,

- traumatic lesions following surgery close to the nerves,

- neurological causes (Guillain-Barr√©, stroke, MS, syringomyelia, diabetic neuropathies, etc.). Laryngeal paralysis is rarely 1<sup>er</sup>;

- cardiac causes (very rare aetiologies): mitral disease, aortic coarctation

- idiopathic paralysis (about 20% of cases): this is a diagnosis of elimination. Recovery occurs in 50% of cases within 6 to 8 months. A viral aetiology is sometimes suggested without any real proof.


BILATERAL immobility

Symptoms are noisier than in the case of unilateral immobility.

Urgency is linked to the risk of dyspnoea:

- immobility with closed strings: dyspnoea is in the foreground, while the voice is usually almost normal. It is a case of "high" or laryngeal dyspnoea, including inspiratory bradypnoea with draught and horniness. This is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency.

- immobility with open strings: significant dysphonia with a voice that is almost inaudible; false routes are possible.


The aetiological approach is identical to that for unilateral immobility.
