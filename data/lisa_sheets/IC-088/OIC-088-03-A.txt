Speech is the modification of sound according to the shape of the aerodigestive tract (the same vibration of the vocal cords will be heard as "a" or "i" depending on the position of the tongue). Language is the use of speech for meaningful purposes.

Speech articulation disorders are known as dysarthria (slowness of speech in Parkinson's patients or stutterers).
