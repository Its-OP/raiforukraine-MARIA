'''Elements of the diagnosis of a suspicious lesion (A)'''

Dragging dysphonia should suggest a malignant lesion. The risk factors are: men over 50, smokers and possible alcohol consumption, but the absence of these factors does not rule out this diagnosis.

Dysphonia appears slowly and progressively worsens. Inspiratory dyspnoea, otalgia and cervical adenopathy are possible.

In fibroscopy, suspicious lesions are :

- whitish, irregular, poorly defined patches,

- vocal cord polyp,

- budding lesion.

In all cases, SLE with biopsy and/or excision is necessary. A negative, "reassuring" biopsy should be followed by surveillance and further biopsies if there is the slightest doubt.


'''Elements of diagnosis of a benign lesion (B)'''

Lesions that are clearly benign on consultation do not always need to be resected in LES.

These are mainly :

- vocal cord nodules: small horny lesions on the vocal cords that occur after chronic vocal abuse (children, teachers)

- granulomas of the posterior third of the cords following intubation

- juvenile laryngeal papillomas, which look like warts (and sometimes require an LES)


Acute dysphonia is generally secondary to acute infectious laryngitis: rapid onset (< 48 hours), odynophagia +/- reflex earache, fever and/or dyspnoea. Nasofibroscopy shows oedema of the laryngeal structures.
