The four main causes of dysphonia found on examination are:

- normal vocal cords but with impaired mobility (uni- or bilateral paralysis) (video 1)

- suspicious vocal cords (malignant lesion): indication for laryngoscopy in suspension (LES) under general anaesthetic for biopsies

- vocal cords with lesions that appear benign: monitoring and LES at the slightest doubt

- normal, mobile vocal cords: referral to a phoniatrician (difficult functional diagnoses)
