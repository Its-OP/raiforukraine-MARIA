'''Signs of COPD severity in a stable state:''' the assessment of COPD severity is primarily clinical (classification A, B, C, D based on the level of dyspnoea and the frequency and severity of exacerbations). It is supplemented by a functional classification based on the measurement of FEV1 (in % of predicted values).

'''Paraclinical signs of severity of a COPD exacerbation:'''

Signs of seriousness will be sought on blood gas analysis ([[Analysis of a blood gas result SD-192|analysis of a blood gas result]])

* Respiratory acidosis (pH<7.35; PaCO2>45mmHg)
* Severe hypoxaemia (Pa02<60 mmHg)
