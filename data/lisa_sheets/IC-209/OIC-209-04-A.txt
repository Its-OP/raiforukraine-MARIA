|Description=Know how to evoke the diagnosis of COPD decompensation in the event of acute respiratory failure in a patient with COPD or at risk of COPD (smoking), know how to look for signs of respiratory struggle, cyanosis, polypnoea > 25/min, signs of hypercapnic encephalopathy (agitation, sweating, flapping), (item 359 and item 332).

An exacerbation is an acute event with prolonged worsening of respiratory symptoms (> 24 hours) beyond their usual variations and requiring a change in treatment.

COPD exacerbations are a frequent reason for seeking care in general practice and in hospital. Exacerbations have a major impact on a patient's prognosis.

Recognition of the signs of severity (signs of struggle and signs of exhaustion, see item 359 [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|acute respiratory distress]]) and the terrain will determine the place of care (outpatient, inpatient, intensive care).

The main criteria justifying hospitalisation are :

* Signs of immediate severity (i.e. [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|acute respiratory distress]], see item 359)
* Rapid worsening of symptoms
* Dyspnoea in daily activities (dressing...) in basal state
* No response to initial medical treatment
* Diagnostic uncertainty
* Advanced age, frailty
* Lack of support at home
* Respiratory assistance at home (long-term oxygen therapy, assisted ventilation)
* Previous intensive care unit stay for exacerbation
* Comorbidities: cardiovascular, alcoholism, neurological, psychiatric, etc.
