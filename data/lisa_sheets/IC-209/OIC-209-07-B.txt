'''In stable condition:'''

- Chest X-rays are of no value in the positive diagnosis of COPD, but they are performed at the time of diagnosis and may reveal co-morbidities (heart disease, cancer). It may show signs of distension in cases of severe disease (see example of a COPD chest X-ray).

- Chest CT is not performed routinely. It may be indicated in severe forms. It can determine the type and extent of emphysema lesions, look for bronchiectasis and detect bronchopulmonary cancer.

'''Exacerbation of COPD:'''

- In the case of outpatient treatment, no further examination is necessary if the picture is typical and does not present any signs of seriousness.

- Chest X-rays are routinely performed in cases of severe exacerbation requiring hospitalisation, or where there is any doubt about the diagnosis.

- An angio-CT scan may be discussed depending on the initial indications (suspicion of pulmonary embolism).
