'''Principles of stable state care'''

*Chronic disease follow-up consultation SD-279|chronic disease follow-up consultation]]: follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a COPD patient,
*Smoking cessation ([[Smoking risk prevention SD-314|smoking risk prevention]])
*Inhaled treatments: bronchodilators (B2 mimetics and/or anticholinergics) and/or inhaled corticosteroids (see figure).
*Vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcus, COVID)
*Physical exercise/respiratory rehabilitation ([[Prescription of a rehabilitation SD-247|prescription of a rehabilitation]], [[Identify a situation of deconditioning to effort SD-353|identify a situation of deconditioning to effort]])
*Treatment of chronic respiratory insufficiency (cf item 208)
**oxygen therapy in cases of severe chronic hypoxaemia
**Non-invasive nocturnal ventilation in cases of severe hypercapnia and frequent exacerbations.
*Dietary advice
*Assessment and management of co-morbidities (particularly cardiovascular).
*Surgery, lung transplantation and interventional endoscopy: limited and targeted indications (severe forms, young subjects, specialist centres).


Principles of exacerbation management

*Bronchodilators (B2 mimetics and/or anticholinergics)
**Outpatient metered dose inhalers
**In-patient nebulisations
*Antibiotics (amoxicillin +/- clavulanic acid, pristinamycin, macrolides - [[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|prescribe an anti-infective]]) if
**the sputum is frankly purulent or
**the underlying COPD is very severe (FEV1<30% of theoretical) '''or'''''
**there are clinical signs of severity.
*Systemic corticosteroid therapy:
**Not systematic
**Prescribed on a case-by-case basis (30 to 40 mg/d for 5 days).
*Respiratory assistance
**Non-invasive ventilation if respiratory acidosis (pH<7.35)
*Oxygen in cases of severe hypoxaemia (target saturation 88% ≤ SpO2≤ 92%)
*Other measures
**Physiotherapy in case of congestion
**Routine preventive HBPM in the event of hospitalisation
