'''Precipitating factors:'''

*Infection, particularly bacterial: ''Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' in the most severe patients; but also viral (particularly in winter): influenza, Rhinovirus, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 ;
*Pollution peaks, heavy smoking, impromptu discontinuation of inhaled background treatments for COPD;
*The cause may remain unknown (1/3 of cases).

'''Diagnoses to be systematically evoked''' (and guiding the prescription of any complementary examinations - [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]):

*Acute community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
*Pulmonary oedema
*Pulmonary embolism
*Pneumothorax
*Thoracic or abdominal surgery, trauma
