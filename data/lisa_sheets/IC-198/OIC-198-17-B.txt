'''In a caricatural way, two elements are important:'''

The terrain differs according to the disease:

- for gout: mature men, often overweight or obese, suffering from cardiovascular disease, kidney failure or diabetes mellitus

- for rheumatism caused by PPCD crystals: elderly subjects

- for apatitic calcium attacks: younger women.

The site of the acute arthritis or periarthritis can sometimes help in the diagnosis:

- Gout: initially affecting the metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP) of the big toe or another joint in the foot (other MTPs, tarsus, ankle),

- Pyrophosphate rheumatism: arthritis of the knee or wrist,

- periarticular attacks linked to apatitic deposits often affect the shoulder, with calcifying tendinitis of the cuff muscles, or the hand, with recurrent pseudophlegmons/abcesses/cellulitis of the fingers or wrists.
