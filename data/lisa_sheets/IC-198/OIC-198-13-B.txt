Analysis of the synovial fluid obtained during an exploratory puncture reveals :

- the presence of inflammatory joint fluid (cellularity greater than 2,000 nucleated cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, sometimes very high up to 100,000/mm<sup>3</sup>), predominantly neutrophils

- Negative results from routine bacteriological tests (possible combination!)

- Inconsistent presence of microcrystals.
