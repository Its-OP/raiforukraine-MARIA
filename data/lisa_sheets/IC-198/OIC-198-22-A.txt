Acute attacks of PPC crystals can be treated in the same way as gouty attacks.

However, the older age of patients, the greater number and severity of their co-morbidities, the number of associated drugs and the risk of interactions mean that NSAIDs and colchicine should be used with even greater caution. Dosage must be adapted to age.

Intra-articular infiltration of a cortisone derivative, provided that an associated infection has been ruled out by examination of the synovial fluid, is a simple solution in cases of monoarthritis.
