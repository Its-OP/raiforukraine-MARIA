Three types of microcrystals are involved:

- crystals of sodium urate (UMS for monosodium urate), responsible for the

gout; uric acid crystals are only found in urine!

- calcium crystals :

- calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) for associated rheumatism;

- of the calcium phosphate type, especially apatite, for radiopaque deposits which are usually periarticular.
