The semiological characteristics of typical articular or periarticular microcrystalline attacks are as follows:

- abrupt onset ;

- intense pain and local inflammation (redness, localised oedema in particular);

- EVA or EN pain â‰¥ 7/10 ;

- maximum symptoms in less than 24 hours;

- Local redness, sometimes very intense (typically peony red);

- spontaneous resolution in a few days to a few weeks, with (initial) restoration of the joint "ad integrum" at the start of the disease.


It is rarely a large acute red leg. Some prodromal symptoms such as burning may be found.
