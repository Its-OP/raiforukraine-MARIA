'''Diagnosing a gout attack'''

Gout attacks usually begin in the lower limb, particularly the foot (MTP joint of the big toe, ankle, then ascending to the knee). Attacks resolve themselves or are shortened or blocked by treatment of the attack. They recur in the absence of hypouricemic treatment with a variable frequency of weeks, months or years. Attacks often occur closer together. At this stage of acute attacks, the joints are normal between attacks. After several years, they may affect the upper limbs. Gout rarely affects the spine, hip or shoulder.


The diagnosis of gout is based on :

- background: men over 35, menopausal women, long-term treatment with diuretics, organ transplants; the family context must be investigated because gout has a strong genetic component (usually a polygenic disease, rare mutations in juvenile gout);

- certain nutritional deviations that highlight gene-environment interactions: excessive consumption of sugary drinks rich in fructose (even "sugar-free" soft drinks), consumption of beer with or without alcohol (rich in guanine), strong alcohols (whisky, cognac, etc.), high-calorie diets (excessive consumption of alcoholic drinks in general) and diets rich in animal proteins;

- history (previous gout attacks, family history of gout, history of uric lithiasis); in a gouty attack, triggers should be sought: trauma, postoperative context, infarction or distant infection, medication (initiation of a hypouricemic agent), intake of certain drinks or foods triggering gouty attacks in a given gout sufferer;

- the characteristics of a microcrystalline crisis ;

- topography ;

- their rapid sensitivity to colchicine (started early);

- the presence of visible and/or clinically palpable tophus;


Reasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test

- uricemia, which is most often found to be above 360 Î¼mol/l (60 mg/l), but which may be normal during attacks (the measurement should be repeated a fortnight after the gouty attack, to obtain a "basal" uricemia before the start of hypouricemic treatment);

- detection of UMS microcrystals in the joint fluid or in a clinical tophus: this is the most important diagnostic test as it is pathognomonic +++.

- requesting an imaging test :

- Joint radiography does not show the appearance of uratic arthropathy until very late, with epiphyseal geodes or notches, prolonged preservation of the joint space and marginal osteophytosis. It is particularly useful for differential diagnosis +++.

- joint ultrasound, with colour Doppler, can be very useful if it shows a "double contour" appearance (corresponding to the uratic deposits present on the surface of the cartilage) or to detect gouty tophus not visible on clinical examination or X-ray. Doppler will show the more intense vascularisation associated with the vascular component of the local inflammatory reaction.


'''Identify situations requiring specialist advice'''

- Any early onset of gout before the age of 35 (on the advice of rheumatologists or specialist nephrologists: look for genetic or kidney diseases).

- Polyarticular gout.

- Tophaceous gout or gouty dactylitis.

- Gout in chronic renal failure (GFR < 60 ml/min).

- Gout in heart failure or unstable coronary artery disease.

- Gout that is difficult to treat (ineffectiveness, intolerance or contraindications to the use of colchicine, NSAIDs and repeated use of oral or intramuscular corticosteroids).

- History of allopurinol allergy before starting febuxostat.
