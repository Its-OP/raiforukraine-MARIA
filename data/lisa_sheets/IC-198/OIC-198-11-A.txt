The acute inflammation caused by the crystals may give rise to general signs (fever, even chills) and an acute biological inflammatory syndrome (elevated CRP, even VS, hyperleucocytosis).

If these signs are present, a joint infection must be ruled out.

However, they may also correspond to an associated infection, the classic trigger for a gout attack. This clinical picture explains the number of emergency visits and hospitalisations.
