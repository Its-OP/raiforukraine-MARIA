Two main mechanisms lead to hyperuricaemia:

- especially a renal and/or intestinal elimination defect;

- excess production of uric acid (rare).


The formation of sodium urate crystals results from chronic hyperuricaemia in excess of 360 µmol/l (60 mg/l), the threshold for saturation of plasma with sodium urate at 35°C (extremity temperature).

As this crystallisation phenomenon is reversible, lowering uricemia below this value allows the crystals to dissolve.

This value also corresponds to the 'target' uricemia that should be reached after initiation of a hypouricemic treatment.

The microcrystals of UMS released into the joints are responsible for acute joint attacks and, over time, for the formation of tissue deposits of UMS in clusters, known as gouty tophus.

In the urine, the pH can be acidic (below 6), allowing the formation of lithiasis, made up of uric acid in the case of hyperuricuria, which can lead to acute attacks of renal colic, and potential uric nephropathy in the case of chronicity.


Gout is usually

- Primary, familial with a male predominance. Various elements of the metabolic syndrome are frequently associated with gout: obesity with increased abdominal circumference ('>'' 94 cm in European men and 88 cm in women), arterial hypertension, glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia with reduced HDL-cholesterol and hypertriglyceridaemia.

Patients with gout should therefore be considered to be at high risk of cardiovascular events, which explains the excess mortality observed!

Gout occurring before the age of 35 is possible in 10-15% of cases. It should be investigated for a genetic origin with abnormalities in the genes encoding uric acid transporters in the renal tubules (''URAT1'', ''ABCG2'').


- secondary to :

- chronic renal failure, which reduces uric acid excretion;

- several years' use of a drug that reduces urinary uric acid excretion, particularly thiazide diuretics, furosemide or etacrynic acid, acetazolamide, but also cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin or certain anti-tuberculosis drugs (ethambutol and pyrazinamide).
