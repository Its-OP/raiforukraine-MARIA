The diagnosis of scabies and pediculosis is primarily clinical: history + suggestive rash + location. Atypical forms may require diagnostic certainty.

For scabies, the parasitological diagnosis is made by microscopic examination of skin samples obtained by scraping the lesions. This direct parasitological diagnosis has a sensitivity of around 50% in common forms, but very good specificity. Sensitivity is higher in hyperkeratotic and profuse forms.

For pediculosis of the scalp and body, examination with the naked eye enables the louse (about 3 mm) to be seen, but it is mobile and difficult to locate. It is easier to detect nits attached to the hair, which can help guide the diagnosis.

Crab (about 1 mm) attached to large hairs (pubis, chest, thighs, armpits, eyelashes) can be seen in the form of a small grey spot near the hair opening; the nits are at the limit of visibility.
