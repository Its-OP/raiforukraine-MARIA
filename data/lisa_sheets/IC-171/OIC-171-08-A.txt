Because scabies is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact, it is considered to be a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) and may lead to a search for other STIs, particularly in adults.

The diagnosis of "pthirosis" requires a search for "high-risk" sexual behaviour and the systematic prescription of an STI biological test.
