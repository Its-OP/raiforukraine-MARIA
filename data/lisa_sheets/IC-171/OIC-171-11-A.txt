[[Management of an ectoparasitosis SD-263|'''<u>For the management of scabies</u>'''',]] the treatment of the patient is accompanied by the treatment of contact subjects defined according to the clinical form and the environment

==='''1-Treatment of the patient:'''===
In common scabies, scabicide treatment is based on :

*general "per os" treatment with a single dose of ivermectin, to be repeated systematically 7 to 14 days after the first dose
*OR local treatment with a benzyl benzoate-based skin emulsion or permethrin-based cream. 2 applications at 8-day intervals.

Patients should be warned that these scabicide treatments frequently exacerbate pruritus. Oral treatment is often preferred because it is easier to use, particularly in the event of an epidemic.

In hyperkeratotic and profuse scabies, general treatment will be combined with local treatment. At the very least, a second course of treatment should be carried out, as for common forms.

===''2-Treatment of close contacts is essential'': see [[Knowing how to treat contacts diagnosed with scabies|Treatment of contacts]]. ===
In groups of children, children must be kept out of school for up to 3 days after treatment for common scabies, and until the parasitological examination is negative for profuse scabies. Scabies is an occupational disease for carers. It can also be nosocomial.

===''3-Hygiene measures'''===

*Treat household linen, clothes, mattresses, stuffed toys, etc. by washing at 60°C or applying an acaricide product and/or isolate the linen in a bag for 72 hours.
*There is no specific environmental treatment for common scabies; conventional cleaning is usually sufficient. In the case of hyperkeratotic, profuse and/or epidemic scabies, treatment of the environment with an acaricide is recommended.


'''<u>The treatment of pediculosis</u>''' of the scalp uses coating agents (dimeticone, coconut oil, petroleum jelly...) and mechanical removal with an anti-lice comb. Since they are not very lenticid, a second application is required 8 days after the first to treat nymphs that have hatched in the meantime. Hats, scarves, stuffed toys, pillows, etc. should also be decontaminated by machine washing (60°C), and all people living in the same household should be examined and any parasites treated. To prevent re-infestation, parents should regularly examine their scalp and use an anti-lice comb.

These products (which are medical devices, not medicines) can also be used for other types of pediculosis, but for pediculosis of the body, decontamination of linen and bedding and personal hygiene are usually sufficient.


'''<u>For pthirosis</u>''', the best treatment is often shaving the affected hair area, don't forget to treat sexual partners. Topical permethrin can also be used as a single application.
