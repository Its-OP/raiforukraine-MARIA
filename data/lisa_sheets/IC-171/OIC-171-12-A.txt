Contact subjects are people who have had intimate contact with the person with scabies. The extent of contact subjects is illustrated by concentric circles centred on the index case, according to the clinical form (common or hyperkeratotic). [https://www.hcsp.fr/explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=312 The occurrence of one or more cases of scabies. What to do (HCSP 2012)].

'''Parasitised patients and their contacts, even if asymptomatic, must be treated simultaneously'''.

Contacts always include sexual partners, people living in the same household and staff carrying out nursing care. This is the <u>1<sup>er</sup> circle of contact subjects</u>, they will be treated in case of common scabies.

The number of contacts may be large in hyperkeratotic, profuse scabies and in the event of epidemics in the community. In these cases, it will be necessary to widen the scope of contacts and treat all members of the community at the same time (residents and carers) (<u>1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>th</sup> circle</u>). After assessing the extent of the epidemic, contacts even further away (visitors) from the index case may also be treated (<u>3<sup>rd</sup> circle</u>).
