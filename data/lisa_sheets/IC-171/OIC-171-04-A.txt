There are '''<u>several clinical forms of scabies</u>'', with semiology varying according to age and terrain.

- common scabies:

The main symptom of scabies is ''[[Pruritus SD-088|pruritus]]''', which is intense, persistent and continuous with nocturnal recrudescence, with a family or collective character. It usually spares the face and scalp. It is more intense in the preferential sites of scabies: palmar interdigital spaces +++, anterior surface of wrists, elbows, anterior axillary areas, mammary areola, umbilicus, buttocks, inner thighs and penis sheath.

The specific lesions of scabies are ''scabious furrows'' terminating at one end in a ''[[Vesicles, vesicular eruption (mucocutaneous) SD-093|beaded blister]]'' and ''''scabious nodules''' (penis). Frequently, there are ''scratching lesions'' in the form of striae, macules and excoriated papules.

- Infant scabies is characterised by palmoplantar vesiculopustular lesions and periaxillary scabious nodules in restless infants who sleep little and writhe. The face and scalp may also be affected.

- Hyperkeratotic scabies'' affects the elderly and immunocompromised in particular. It is associated with erythroderma and extensive scaly, crusty lesions; these lesions may be diffuse over the whole body. Not very pruritic, it is highly contagious (numerous sarcoptes).

- Profuse scabies is favoured by local or general immunodepression. The skin eruption (erythematous, more or less hyperkeratotic plaques) is extensive, the result of a late diagnosis. It often occurs in the elderly.

Complications'': scabies can be complicated by bacterial skin infection (impetiginisation) and eczema.


'''<u>scalp pediculosis</u>''' combines daytime and nocturnal pruritus of the scalp, diffuse or more intense at the nape of the neck or retroauricular region with scratching lesions, superinfected crusty lesions (impetiginisation) and sometimes cervical adenopathy. Nits may be found at the hairline.


In '''<u>body pediculosis</u>''', pruritus is accompanied by an urticarial, eczematiform rash and disseminated scratching lesions with predominance on the covered regions (trunk, waist, armholes), these lesions may be haemorrhagic and superinfect, adenopathies are frequent. Nits and lice can be found in the folds of clothing.
