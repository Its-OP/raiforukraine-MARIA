Scabies is a skin infection caused by a mite: ''Sarcoptes scabiei'' variety ''hominis.''

The female digs a sinuous tunnel, called a "furrow", at the base of the horny layer of the epidermis on which she feeds and where she lays her eggs.

The antigens of these mites, their eggs and excrement, generate an immune reaction that causes pruritus and skin lesions (vesicles, nodules, papules). The clinical signs are therefore the consequence of the parasitic infestation and the body's reaction.

The first symptoms appear on average 3 weeks after an initial infection. This incubation period lasts a few days in the event of re-infection.

Outside the epidermis (linen), the sarcopte is infectious for 24 to 72 hours.
