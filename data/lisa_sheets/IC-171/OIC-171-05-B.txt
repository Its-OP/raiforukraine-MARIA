There are many atypical forms of scabies:

- lesion-free forms

- forms with atypical localisations: involvement of the back, neck, face and scalp, usually spared in common scabies

- bullous forms

- forms with a maculo-papular, vesiculo-papular or nodular rash

It is essential to look for the possibility of scabies if there is a cluster of cases.
