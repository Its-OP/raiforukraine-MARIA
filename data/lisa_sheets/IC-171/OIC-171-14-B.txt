Two cases of scabies occurring less than six weeks apart in the same community may be considered to be an outbreak.

The management strategy will be developed in consultation with the health authorities, the hygiene unit and the hospital's medical and paramedical staff.

It can be described in <u>7 stages</u>:

# report cases early internally and to the health authorities in the event of an epidemic
# set up a "support unit" within the local authority
# carry out a rapid assessment of the epidemic
# introduce general hygiene measures - patients with hyperkeratotic or profuse scabies will be isolated in single rooms
# provide targeted information to patients and contacts...
# implement the therapeutic strategy for the index patient and contact cases, who will need to be treated simultaneously
# implement environmental measures

Dealing with a scabies epidemic requires a great deal of <u>coordination between the various players involved</u>.
