There are many causes of failure in the treatment of scabies and pediculosis:

* poor compliance (lack of understanding, ignorance, negligence)
* the cost of certain treatments
* failure to take a second dose of ivermectin between D7 and D14 (scabies)
* insufficient application of the product (scabies and pediculosis)
* re-infestation: from untreated contacts or from the environment
