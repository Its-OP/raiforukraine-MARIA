Questioning is essential and should include: personal history of haemorrhage; date of onset of signs; type of bleeding (cutaneous, mucous, visceral, joint); whether spontaneous or provoked: bleeding after invasive procedures or surgery, with resumption and/or transfusion? in women, menorrhagia, etc.; history of anaemia and/or martial therapy; family history of haemorrhage; recent drug treatments, particularly those that interfere with haemostasis (antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs).

The clinical examination should look for bleeding in the skin (petechial purpura, ecchymosis), mucous membranes (mouth, pharynx), deep tissues (haematoma) or joints (haemarthrosis); signs of anaemia or martial deficiency; signs of underlying pathology: liver or kidney failure, infection, autoimmune disease (lupus in particular), malignant haemopathy, cancer.

Questioning and clinical examination may point to a primary haemostasis and/or coagulation disorder (see table below) and a constitutional or acquired aetiology.
