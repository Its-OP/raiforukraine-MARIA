Thrombopathy is a functional platelet disorder that is associated with unexplained mucocutaneous bleeding and a normal platelet count, with normal APTT and PT.

They are frequently acquired and mainly due to drugs (antiplatelets, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, antidepressants, etc.), sometimes associated with haemopathies (myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes, monoclonal gammopathies).

Constitutional thrombopathies are very rare and dominated by Glanzmann thrombasthenia (quantitative or qualitative abnormality of GPIIb-IIIa).
