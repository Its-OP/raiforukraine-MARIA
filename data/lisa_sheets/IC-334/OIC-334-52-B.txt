'''Physiological features of the brain:'''

*the brain has high metabolic needs and no energy reserves: a constant supply of oxygen and glucose is required
*self-regulation of cerebral blood flow: cerebral blood flow (CBF) is kept constant to guarantee a constant metabolic supply (oxygen and glucose) to the brain
*cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the driving pressure of the DSC: CPP = MAP - ICP (MAP = mean arterial pressure in the cerebral blood vessels; ICP = intra-cranial pressure) (Figure 21)
*the cranium is inextensible: any increase in intracranial volume (cerebral parenchyma, cerebral blood volume or cerebrospinal fluid) generates an increase in ICP.
*any increase in ICP or decrease in MAP compromises cerebral energy supply: risk of cerebral ischaemic lesions

'''Pathophysiological principles of traumatic brain injury (Figure 22):'''

* primary lesions: occurring during the initial trauma: mechanism of direct contact or inertia (deceleration)
* secondary lesions: developing at a distance from the initial trauma and reaching a viable cerebral area known as the penumbra[[File:ACSOS Cerebral Secondary Attacks of Systemic Origin.jpg|vignette|ACSOS: Cerebral Secondary Attacks of Systemic Origin]]<br />.
