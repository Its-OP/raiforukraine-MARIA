A burn ("''[[Burn SD-168|burn]]'''') is defined as the traumatic destruction of the skin and underlying tissues by a process that is :

*Thermal in 90% of cases, caused by: liquids >flames >> explosions > solids > vapours,
*electrical in <5% of cases (high voltage, low voltage, flash, lightning),
*chemical (<3% of cases)
*mechanical (dermabrasion, traumatic skin avulsion)
*exceptionally, radiation.

Different types of burn depending on depth (Figure 5):

*1<sup>er</sup> degree, characterised by painful erythema
*2<sup>th</sup> degree, characterised by damage to the epidermal basement membrane and dermis with phlyctenes and epidermal detachment
*[[File:Item 334 Figure 5bis 1st to 3rd degree burns.jpg|alt=|thumbnail|Figure 5. 1st to 3rd degree burns]]3<sup>th</sup> degree, characterised by destruction of the dermis and skin appendages with disappearance of discolouration on in vitro pressure, and atonic, dry, cardboardy, insensitive and painless skin with loss of the phanera.
