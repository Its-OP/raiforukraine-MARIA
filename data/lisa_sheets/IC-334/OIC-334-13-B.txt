Smoke inhalation is as much a local lesion (tracheobronchial tree and lung parenchyma) that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as a systemic pathology with a major inflammatory syndrome evolving on its own account (figure 8).

Smoke inhalation is often associated with intoxication by hypoxaemic and/or asphyxiating gases.

Screening for carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) poisoning should be carried out systematically in the presence of :

*cardiac and/or respiratory arrest
*heart rhythm disorders
*consciousness disorders ("Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|''coma and consciousness disorders''']").
*pre-hospital blood gas hyperlactataemia ("[Analysis of a blood gas result SD-192|'''analysis of a blood gas result''']")
*smoke background
