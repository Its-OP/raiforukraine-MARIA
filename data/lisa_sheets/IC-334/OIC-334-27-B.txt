|'''Common principles of care''''
|-
|Continuous monitoring in a continuous monitoring unit if signs of seriousness
|-
> 2 rib fractures
|-
|- age > 65, chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disease, coagulation disorder
|-
|- acute respiratory distress or shock
|-
|Analgesia
|-
|- multimodal analgesia
|-
|- Morphine titration + morphine PCA +/- locoregional analgesia (epidural or truncular by intercostal or paravertebral blocks)
|-
|Invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation
|-
|- risk of compressing an undrained pneumothorax
|-
|Antibioprophylaxis 24-48 h if penetrating trauma
|-
|- Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid / clindamycin-gentamycin if allergic

The identification of situations indicating recourse to rescue therapy is presented in figure 18 ([[2C-334-IU-A02]], [[2C-334-EC-A01]]).
