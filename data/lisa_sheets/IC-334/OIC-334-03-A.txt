Circumstances of the accident: questioning of witnesses or victim(s):

* kinetics: estimated speed, condition of vehicle(s), death of victim, airbag triggered, type of vehicle(s) involved
* helmet/seatbelt use

Nature of the victim(s): interviewing witnesses or the victim(s):

* number of victims
* age of victim(s)
* history of the victim(s)

Description of the nature of the traumatic injuries: complete clinical examination of the following 5 areas of the body ("like the 5 fingers of the hand")

* Head injuries :
** open or closed, severe or non-severe head trauma
** trauma to the face: airway obstruction, open or closed fracture, active haemorrhage, external or not (epistaxis)

* Thoracic injuries :
** open or closed trauma
** chest flap, auscultatory asymmetry, subcutaneous emphysema
** seat belt sign

* Abdominal and pelvic injuries:
** open or closed trauma
** abdominal distension, dullness
** pelvic instability, urethrorrhagia

* Spinal injuries :
** lesion level of a neurological deficit
** anal hollowness on rectal examination

* Traumatic limb injuries:
** open or closed fractures
** wound with active or passive haemorrhage
** pulse palpation
