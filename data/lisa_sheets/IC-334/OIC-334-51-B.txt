Head trauma :

*minor: Glasgow ≥ 13
*moderate: Glasgow between 9 and 12
*severe: Glasgow ≤ 8

Bear in mind the dynamic nature of this classification: the severity stage changes according to the fluctuation in the state of consciousness.

Each component of the Glasgow score must be reported separately (ocular, verbal and motor) as they do not have the same prognostic value.

The presence of localised signs is a sign of severity. The presence of unilateral or bilateral mydriasis should suggest a neurosurgical emergency, linked to temporal involvement or a major drop in cerebral blood flow.
