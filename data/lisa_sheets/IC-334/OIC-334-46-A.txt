1 '''Circumstances, functional and physical signs:'''

*A spinal injury should be suspected in the event of :
**Evocative context: polytrauma patient, unconscious injured person.
**Spinal syndrome = localised pain on palpation of the spinous processes + segmental stiffness.
**Perception of a cracking noise in the spine
**Existence of stiffness or, on the contrary, perception of instability, particularly in the cervical region
**On inspection: ecchymosis, localised deformity, protrusion of a spine.
**Paraesthesia or weakness in the limbs, or even paralysis.
*A neurological lesion:
**Must be sought in any patient with spinal trauma and a clinical examination recorded and time-stamped is systematic.
**May be medullary or radicular.
**The examination must be repeated over time, particularly after any mobilisation.
**During the clinical examination, note the vertebral level and the neurological level when there is such an impairment.

2 ''Neurological examination of a spinal injury and determination of the ASIA score''

*The neurological examination must be exhaustive and complete.
*The ASIA score: a rapid bilateral coded neurological examination to determine :
**Neurological level
**whether it is complete or incomplete
**Partial preservation zone (partially innervated territory)
*Motor examination :
**ASIA score: rating of muscle strength (from 0 to 5) of 10 muscles or muscle groups (score /100).
**Also looks for phrenic paralysis and damage to the intercostal muscles.      
*Sensitivity study (superficial, proprioceptive, thermoalgesic):
**ASIA score: scoring of ''algic sensitivity and epicritic tact'' (0 to 2) over 28 metamers (score /112 per modality tested).
**Complex or even impossible in the event of anaesthesia for intubation or in the event of vigilance disorders.
*Examination of the perineum:
**ASIA score: '''anal sensitivity''', '''voluntary contraction of the anal sphincter.'''
**Essential for diagnosing incomplete damage or in cases of trauma to the sacral region.
*It is also necessary to :
**Search for osteotendinous reflexes.
**Look for pyramidal signs (absent in cases of spinal shock).
**Look for pejorative signs (complete spinal cord injury) in an unconscious patient:
***Priapism
***Anal hollowness, anal sphincter atonia''.
