1. initial pre-hospital care

* Avoid any risk of neurological aggravation.
** Stabilisation of the spine:
*** Any polytrauma or head injury is a spinal cord injury until proven otherwise.
*** Protective manoeuvres to maintain the head-neck-torso axis: release onto a "hard surface", use of a "shell mattress", application of a "semi-rigid neck brace" with sternal and chin support.
** Control of factors aggravating neurological lesions: "glycaemic control", "absence of hypoxia", "normocapnia" if the patient is on mechanical ventilation and "temperature control".
* Clinical signs of haemodynamic instability in 60% of patients:
** One or even two safe venous access ports of good calibre to ensure PAS ≥ 100mmHg and MAP ≥ 85mmHg, with early initiation of vasopressors (norepinephrine, ephedrine) if necessary.
** Exclude other causes of shock (haemorrhage, tamponade, tension pneumothorax).
* Frequent respiratory impairment:
** '''Control of the airway''': free the upper airway by subluxation of the mandible, Guedel oropharyngeal cannula, oro-tracheal intubation in case of respiratory distress or Glasgow ≤ 8: use of devices avoiding significant mobilisation of the cervical spine which would cause secondary displacement.
** '''Control of ventilation and oxygenation:''' 0<sub>2</sub> high flow in case of hypoxia (objective SpO<sub>2</sub> ≥ 94%), ventilation assistance if necessary.


2 ''Surgical management'' of spinal trauma

* In a ''specialised'' centre treating complex trauma.
* Depends on a number of parameters (type of injury, presence of neurological deficit, associated injuries, etc.) and the results of the radiological assessment carried out.
* Objective:
** '''Decompression of compressed neurological elements'' potentially recoverable in the event of neurological disorders.
** Reduction of the fracture site in the event of significant displacement.
** Restraint of the fracture site if there is a risk of secondary displacement (unstable fracture): immobilisation by corset, percutaneous or open surgical stabilisation.
* Corticosteroid therapy for neuroprotective purposes is "not recommended".
