'''Calculation of Glasgow score '''([[2C-334-DE-B02]]) ''':''''

*after correction of haemodynamic, metabolic or respiratory failure, without sedation
*standardised verbal and nociceptive stimulation

'''Search for signs of localisation'''

'''Examination of pupillary motricity:'''

*intrinsic (nerve III): pupillary diameter and reactivity to light stimulation
*extrinsic: ptosis - external strabismus (nerve III paralysis); diplopia downwards and to the healthy side (nerve IV paralysis); internal strabismus (nerve VI paralysis)
