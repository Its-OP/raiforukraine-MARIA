1. '''Standard radiography:''''

*In all polytrauma patients (figure 3) (2C-334-PC-B02):
**frontal chest X-ray: look for a pneumothorax or pleural effusion
**Front pelvis X-ray: look for a fracture that may have caused non-external pelvic retroperitoneal haemorrhage leading to haemorrhagic shock.
*If there is a clinical suspicion of a fracture, X-ray '''front and side'''
**of the bone or joint in question: be specific about the anatomical area to be observed
**with the "overlying and underlying joints" in the case of a long bone fracture
**respect the ''Ottawa criteria'' to avoid making radiographs of sprains. Only one of the following criteria should require an X-ray

|'''Knee'''
|-
|
* Pain at the tip and distal 6 cm above the malleoli.
* Pain at the base of the 5th metatarsal.

2. '''Scanner: ''''

*In all polytrauma patients: full-body CT scan injected with the pelvis (figure 4) ([[2C-334-PC-B03]]).
*Without injection
**in case of complex joint fracture.
**in case of clinical doubt about a fracture not seen on X-ray.
**angioscanner in case of vascular damage with abolition of pulses.
