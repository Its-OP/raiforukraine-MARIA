Common principles of initial fracture management :

* alignment, reduction if displaced, immobilisation

* emergency antiobioprophylaxis in the event of an open fracture
* tetanus prevention: assess vaccination status or carry out a rapid immunological test to detect anti-tetanus antibodies (see table below)
* specialist advice
