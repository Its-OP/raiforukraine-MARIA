'''Radiographic signs of pneumothorax:'''

*partial peripheral hyperclarity (particularly at the apex on a standing or sitting film) or complete hyperclarity of a lung hemichamber
*visualisation of the visceral pleura in the form of a fine linear opacity
*signs of severity (tension pneumothorax): retraction of the lung parenchyma in the form of a dense opacity around the hilum, mediastinal deviation contralateral to the pneumothorax, flattening of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome.

'''Radiological signs of haemothorax:'''

*dense, homogeneous, sloping opacity, effacing the diaphragmatic dome, with concave upper edge (Damoiseau's line) in the standing or sitting position
*asymmetric transparency of the pulmonary hemifields with diffuse greying of the affected side in the supine position
*sign of severity (compressive haemothorax): contralateral mediastinal deviation
*in the case of pneumothorax associated with a haemothorax (haemopneumothorax): the fluid effusion (in the standing or sitting position) is delimited on its upper surface by a horizontal hydroaeric level.
