'''Anamnesis:'''

* search for the sequence ''trauma - pain - deformity - functional impotence'', highly suggestive of a bone or joint lesion
* mechanism and intensity of pain
* associated sensory-motor disorders
* significant history (metastatic neoplasia, osteoporosis, vaccination status)

Checking vital signs for general signs of seriousness.

Bilateral and comparative physical examination:

* inspection: bruise, wound, loss of substance, contamination, recolouring time, deformity, shortening
* palpation: peripheral pulses, compartment tension, assessment of muscle strength and sensitivity
* passive mobilisation in an analgesic patient.
