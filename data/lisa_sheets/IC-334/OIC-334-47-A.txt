Traumatic spinal cord injury may be complete or partial, resulting from compression or transection.

1. lesion syndrome

* Refers to the ''site of the lesion'': spinal cord and roots affected at the level of the lesion with absence of reflex circuit with a clinical picture of peripheral involvement :
** '''Flaccid paralysis'' of muscles controlled from the affected spinal cord and/or the roots which originate from it
** '''Sensory impairment'''
** Abolition of osteotendinous reflexes.
* The ''lesion level'' is assessed by examining epicritic sensitivity per dermatome, bilaterally, noting whether it is complete or incomplete. The lesion level corresponds to the ''first metamerism affected''.


'''2.        Subinjury syndrome'''

* Suffering of the spinal cord below the lesion, comprising in isolation or in various combinations:
** A '''pyramidal syndrome'''
*** Loss of fine voluntary movements.
*** Diffuse sharp osteotendinous reflexes.
*** Anomaly of cutaneous reflexes (Babinski sign, Hoffman sign).
*** Spastic hypertonia.
*** Epileptoid trepidation of the foot, clonus of the patella.
** Motor deficit.
** Posterior cord syndrome (proprioceptive deficit),
** Spinothalamic syndrome (thermoalgesic deficit, sometimes with distortion, delay and diffusion of the stimulus).
** Sphincter disorders: dysuria and reflex incontinence, constipation and recto-anal dyschesia.
* Spinal shock:
** '''Temporary spinal cord sideration''' (a few days) sometimes observed in the acute post-traumatic phase (always present in cases of complete spinal cord injury) associating flaccid para/tetraplegia, total sub-lesional anaesthesia and retention of urine and faeces.
** Complete spinal cord injury can only be confirmed with certainty once the spinal shock has resolved.
* Concussion: mimics acute spinal cord injury but recovers within a few hours. No anatomical lesion.
