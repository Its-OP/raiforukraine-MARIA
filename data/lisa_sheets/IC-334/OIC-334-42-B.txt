'''General principles'''

For all limb fractures, specific management will take place in two stages:

* reduction of displacement" = restoration of normal anatomy (axis, length, rotation of the fractured segment)
* contention" = maintenance of the reduction, either by immobilisation (plaster cast or not = orthopaedic treatment), or by means of osteosynthesis (surgical treatment).

'''Common therapeutic measures:''''

* multimodal systemic analgesia +/- locoregional truncal analgesia ([[Local, locoregional and general anaesthesia|item 136]])
* rehabilitation: early mobilisation, physiotherapy, standing, finger/toe mobility under plaster, active recovery of joint amplitudes and muscle strength
* prevention of venous thromboembolism, adapted to the risk of haemorrhage, the terrain and the duration of immobilisation

'''Closed fractures:''''

* non-displaced and uncomplicated, stable: orthopaedic medical treatment: reduction + plaster cast
* unstable or displaced: surgical treatment: reduction + osteosynthesis under local or general anaesthetic

'''Open fractures:''''

* emergency treatment < 6 h after trauma
* Emergency antibiotic prophylaxis: high-dose intravenous antibiotics covering aerobic and anaerobic soil germs, with good penetration of bone and soft tissues:
** amoxicillin + clavulanic acid in the absence of allergy to penicillin / clindamycin + gentamycin if allergic to penicillin.
** duration: < 24 h if Cauchoix 1 or Gustillo I or II; 24 to 48 h if Cauchoix 2 or Gustillo IIIa; sometimes > 48 h if Cauchoix 3 or Gustillo IIIb or IIIc and heavy soil contamination.
* removal of foreign bodies and devitalized tissues, detersion, lavage, wound trimming: it is advisable to trim the wound iteratively (every 48 hours) in cases of severe decay.
* suture of the wound or cover flap if suture is not possible
* vascular bypass if Gustillo IIIc
* reduction and surgical osteosynthesis according to severity stage

'''Surveillance'''

* clinical: local and general complications, monitoring a patient in plaster, remote consultation
* radiology at D0, D7, D15, D30, D45: secondary displacement or pseudarthrosis
