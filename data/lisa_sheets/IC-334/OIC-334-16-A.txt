Any medical history increases the prognosis of a burn, with 2 major factors: age and diabetes (due to healing difficulties).

The circumstances in which the burn occurred must be clearly identified, and are essential in order to avoid overlooking associated trauma or intoxication that could worsen the prognosis.

There is no official definition of severe burns. The experts suggest taking into account "serious burns with vital risk" and "serious burns with functional risk" (Recommendations for Professional Practice SFAR/SFB 2019).

'''In adults:''''

* burned skin area (BSA) > 20%, third-degree BSA > 5%, smoke inhalation syndrome, particular deep location (face, hands, feet, perineum), high-voltage electrical burn.
* uu SCB < 20% AND special circumstances: age >75 years, severe co-morbidities, suspected or proven smoke inhalation, deep circular burn, particular deep location: face, hands, feet, perineum, folds, SCB > 10%, third degree SCB between 3 and 5%, low voltage electrical burn, chemical burn (hydrofluoric acid).

'''In children:''''

* SCB > 10%, third-degree SCB > 5% (see figure 3), infant < 1 year old, severe comorbidities, smoke inhalation syndrome, particular deep location (face, hands, feet, perineum, flexion creases), circular burn, electrical or chemical burn.
