Open fractures: damage to the skin and soft tissues bringing the fracture site into contact with the outside world

Two classifications are commonly used:

1 '''The Cauchoix classification:'''

*Stage 1: puncture wound suturable without tension
*Stage 2: large wound, with skin contusion, suturable but with risk of necrosis
*Stage 3: wound with loss of substance that cannot be closed with a simple suture

2. the Gustilo classification (figure 21).

Open Gustilo III fractures are the result of high-energy trauma (MVA, crush injuries, firearms) with significant wound contamination, and are accompanied by complex comminuted fractures which may involve loss of bone substance.
