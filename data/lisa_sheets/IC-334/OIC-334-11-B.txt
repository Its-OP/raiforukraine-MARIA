Smoke inhalation is suspected when several elements are combined:

* fire in an enclosed space (building, car)
* presence of soot in the oropharynx or sputum
* respiratory symptoms associating dry cough, dysphonia with hoarseness of voice, wheezing, ronchi and sibilants
* signs of acute respiratory distress ("acute respiratory distress SD-160")
* burning ("''[[Burn SD-168|burn]]'''") of the face with the presence of soot around the mouth and nose (vibrissae damage): not indicative of smoke inhalation, but should be considered for diagnosis.
