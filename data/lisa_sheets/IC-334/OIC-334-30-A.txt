Management is similar to that for severe trauma (figure 3)([[2C-334-PC-B02]]).

*FAST ultrasound:'''' look for fluid effusion in Morrisson's space, in the left spleno-renal recess and in the pouch of Douglas.
*Front X-ray of the pelvis:'''' look for a fracture or disjunction, referring the patient for emergency arterioembolisation in the event of a haemorrhagic syndrome that cannot be explained by another cause.
*Body scan or whole-body CT scan as soon as possible after stabilisation.

The combination of haemodynamic instability, a positive FAST scan and a pelvic X-ray showing no bone fracture of the pelvic ring indicates emergency surgical haemostasis (damage control surgery).
