Continuing care monitoring :

* stable patient + anatomical lesion requiring neither surgery nor embolisation
* conservative treatment of spleen fractures+++: risk of delayed rupture up to day 30, justifying hospitalisation for 2 weeks.

Antibiotics :

* antibiotic prophylaxis in the event of peri-operative or penetrating trauma
* antibiotic therapy in the event of perforation of the digestive tract

Monitoring intra-abdominal pressures :

* measurement of intra-vesical pressure and abdominal circumference
* search for abdominal hyper-pressure + organ failure: indication for placement of a laparostoma
