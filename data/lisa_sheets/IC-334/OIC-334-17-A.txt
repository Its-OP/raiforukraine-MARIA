In addition to the clinical examination of the face (figure 14) and the circumstances, the burning of the upper airways can be confirmed by a bronchial fibroscopy, which finds soot in the tracheobronchial tree (figure 15). The extent of the soot deposit is not necessarily related to the severity of the lung damage.
