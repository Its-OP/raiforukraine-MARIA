'''Neurological complications:''''

* realignment of the limb or reduction of the fracture: removal of nerve compression
* in the case of axonal injury without nerve section (axonotmesis): total or partial spontaneous recovery after a variable period depending on the level of injury: the more proximal the injury, the longer the recovery.
* in the case of nerve transection (neurotmesis): permanent and stable deficit; surgical suturing of the transected nerve may allow partial recovery.

'''Vascular complications:''''

* haemorrhage (externalised or not): haemostasis or embolisation in the absence of spontaneous haemostasis.
* ischaemia due to compression or arterial injury: reduction of the fracture (or dislocation) +/- surgical revascularisation in the event of persistent ischaemia.

'''Myotendinous complications:'''

* treatment specific to each of these lesions.

'''Syndrome de loge :'''

* hospitalisation in intensive care unit or intensive care unit depending on severity
* emergency treatment < 6 h
* aponevrotomy of all muscle compartments
* dressing every 48 hours and excision of necrotic tissue

'''Acute post-traumatic rhabdomyolysis or "crush syndrome"''''

* hospitalisation in an intensive care unit or intensive care unit, depending on severity
* correction of hypovolaemia by aggressive volume expansion with crystalloids (500 ml/h)
* alkalinisation of urine to maintain a urinary pH > 6 by administering sodium bicarbonate solution guided by urinary pH monitoring
* monitoring of diuresis, urinary pH, haemodynamic parameters such as blood volume, kalaemia, calcium and phosphorus levels
* adequate treatment of hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia

'''Fat embolism syndrome:'''

* preventive treatment: early and complete immobilisation of fracture sites + control of hypovolaemia + treatment of stress and pain to avoid mobilisation of fracture sites
* curative treatment: purely symptomatic: oxygen therapy +/- mechanical ventilation depending on severity

'''Thrombo-embolic complications:'''

* specific treatment for each thromboembolic complication.

'''Infectious complications: sepsis and septic shock in open fractures'''

* [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|item 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|item 158]]

'''Hemorrhagic shock'''

* blood loss in the first 6 hours: 2000 ml for femur fractures, 1000 ml for tibia fractures, up to 5000 ml for complex pelvic fractures
* blood transfusion, reduction and osteosynthesis as soon as possible
* in the event of a state of shock disproportionate to the fractures identified: search for other sources of bleeding on whole-body CT scan<br />.
