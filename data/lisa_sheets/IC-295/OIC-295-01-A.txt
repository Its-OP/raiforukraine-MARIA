The care pathway for a patient suffering from cancer is codified and involves several disciplines, in particular surgery, radiotherapy, medical oncology, but also support care (e.g. specialised pain management or oncofertility) and palliative care: palliative care must be considered from the very beginning of the progression of non-curable forms, for early palliative care.

Many cancers can now be cured, and the survival of metastatic forms can often be measured in years. As a result, new needs have to be taken into account. Supportive care is increasingly important at all stages of the disease. During the monitoring phase of treated cancers, a global dimension of care for the individual needs to be integrated into the care plan (tertiary prevention). In all cases, the psychosocial dimension must be taken into account.

From a societal point of view, even if its image is evolving, cancer has a special dimension compared to other life-threatening chronic diseases. At the end of the 20th century, activism on the part of associations and growing social awareness led to the implementation of the first "Cancer Plan" in 2003, followed by the creation of the National Cancer Institute (INCa) in 2005:

- There have been 3 successive Cancer Plans between 2003 and 2019. These are national plans, supported at the highest level of government by the Presidents of the Republic, aimed at mobilising public health players around prevention, screening, the organisation of care, research, support for patients and their families and post-cancer care (in the future, the missions of the Cancer Plan should be taken over by "chronic disease" plans). A new 2021-2030 cancer plan is currently underway.

- INCa is an expert health agency working on behalf of the French government. In addition to its research and training missions, INCa contributes to the organisation and improvement of healthcare and helps to implement regulatory provisions relating to cancer, such as the announcement system and the personalised post-cancer programme.
