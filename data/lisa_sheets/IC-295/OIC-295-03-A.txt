The personalised care programme (PPS) is a written document:

- given to patients at the start of their treatment,

- validated by a multidisciplinary consultation meeting

- with personalised details of the treatments planned.

The PPS should include a support care component in accordance with the recommendations of the INCA.


NB: this concerns initial treatment as well as relapses.
