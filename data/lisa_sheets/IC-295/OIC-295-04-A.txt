In addition to the clinical examination and radiological assessment of the tumour lesions (including their evolution under treatment), the assessment must systematically specify :

- pain symptomatology and consumption of analgesics, ([[Neurophysiological bases, physiopathological mechanisms of acute and chronic pain]]) ([[Analgesic, medicinal and non-medicinal therapies]] )

- changes in weight and appetite and the search for clinical signs of undernutrition, ([[Therapeutic lifestyle modifications (diet and physical activity) in adults and children and knowing how to present them to patients]]) and ([[Undernutrition in adults and children]])

- the activity index (Performance Status - PS) according to the WHO/ECOG scale '''(Table below)''''
