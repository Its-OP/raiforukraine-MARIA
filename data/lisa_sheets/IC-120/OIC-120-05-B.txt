Respiratory (congestion, atelectasis, bronchopulmonary infection)

De-recruitment of posterior pulmonary zones, impaired mucociliary clearance, impaired diaphragmatic stroke, micro inhalations


Venous thromboembolic embolic disease (VTEED)

Decrease in peripheral blood volume + venous stasis +/- MTVE history +/- recent surgery +/- inflammatory sd +/- limb immobilisation


Escarre

Prolonged soft tissue pressure above the capillary perfusion pressure (33 mmHg) in relation to a bony prominence


Orthostatic hypotension

Venous blood stagnation not regulated by the neurovegetative system when moving to an upright position


Mechanical (ankylosis)

Capsulo-ligament and tendon retraction


Constipation

Stercoral stasis +/- transit-slowing drugs (e.g. opiates)


Urinary tract infection

Decreased bladder emptying +/- urinary catheter


Mental disorders

Anxiety linked to the initial illness or trauma, insomnia, dependence linked to immobilisation, pain, sensory deconditioning
