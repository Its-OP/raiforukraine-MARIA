Respiratory (congestion, atelectasis, bronchopulmonary infection)

Alternate postures (dorsal/lateral decubitus), head of bed between 30 and 45Â°, sitting position for meals.


Venous thromboembolic embolic disease (VTEED)

Venous restraint of the IM, regular muscular contraction or pressure of the IM, early raising, optimisation of hydration, preventive anticoagulant treatment.

Escarre

Change position every 2 to 3 hours, move to the chair as soon as possible, prevent rubbing and shearing injuries, prevent maceration, optimise nutritional intake, educate the patient and those around them, provide appropriate support (mattress, seat cushion, etc.).


Orthostatic hypotension

Wearing elastic support stockings, physical activity during decubitus, gradual standing up, optimising hydration.


Mechanical (ankylosis)

Avoid segmental flexion positions, alternate postures, joint mobilisation (at least passive)


Urinary tract infection

Optimisation of hydration +/- early removal of urinary catheter
