*Urination problems are now known as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

*LUTS are subjective indicators perceived by the patient that suggest a disease or pathological condition of the lower urinary tract.
*LUTS can be classified into three categories: symptoms of the filling phase, symptoms of the voiding phase and symptoms of the post-voiding phase (table 1).
*Daytime urinary frequency is defined as an increase in urinary frequency during the day (there is no threshold).
*Nocturnal pollakiuria is defined as an increase in urinary frequency at night. It should not be confused with nocturia, defined as a need to urinate that wakes the patient.
*Urgency is defined as a sudden, imperious and frequently irrepressible desire to urinate.
*Overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical syndrome defined by the occurrence of urgency with or without urinary incontinence, usually associated with pollakiuria or nocturia.
*Urge dysuria is defined as urination with a concomitant abdominal thrust.
