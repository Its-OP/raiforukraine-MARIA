*'''<big>In women:</big>''' urinary incontinence is a public health problem affecting 25-45% of women. The frequency and severity of urinary incontinence increases with age.

*'''<big>In men:</big>''' urinary incontinence is much less common than in women for anatomical reasons (prostate, long urethra).

*<big>'''The overall prevalence of overactive bladder'''</big> in France is estimated at 14.4% and increases with age.

*It is estimated that 46% of adults suffer from at least one lower urinary tract symptom.

*The main risk factors in women are: age, obstetrical history, [[Menopause, premature ovarian failure, andropause, age-related androgen deficiency|menopause 124]], [[Childhood and adult obesity (see item 71)|obesity 253]]], [[Benign hypertrophy (see item 71)|obesity 253]].
*The main risk factors in men are: age, [[Childhood and adult obesity (see item 71)|obesity 253]], [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|prostate surgery 127]].

*A mnemonic for remembering the risk factors and reversible causes of incontinence in the elderly is DIAPPERS:
**D: Delirium (confusional syndrome)
**I: Infection
**A: Vaginal atrophy
**P: Psychological causes (depressive syndrome)
**P: Pharmacological causes
**E: Excess diuresis
**R: Restriction of mobility
**S: Constipation (Stool impaction)
