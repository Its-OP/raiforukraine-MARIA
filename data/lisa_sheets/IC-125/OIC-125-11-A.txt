* For a long time, BPH in men was considered to be caused exclusively by [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) 127]]. Although BPH is one of the most frequent causes of LUTS in men, it has now been established that they are largely multifactorial.

* In both men and women, dysuria can result from either subvesical obstruction or detrusor hypocontractility.
* The main causes of subvesical obstruction are BPH (men), urethral stricture, bladder-sphincter dyssynergia and bladder neck disease.
* Hypocontractility may be part of a picture of peripheral neurological bladder (cause: any peripheral neuropathy), result from prolonged subvesical obstruction or have no identifiable cause ("idiopathic").
