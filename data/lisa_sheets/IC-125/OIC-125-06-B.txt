*Normal physiological functioning of the lower urinary tract requires :
**Functional corticoencephalic centres
**intact sensory and motor neurological pathways
**A good quality bladder reservoir: low pressure and emptying without residue.
**Competent sphincters (striated and smooth)

Damage to any of these structures can lead to urinary incontinence and/or hydrops.

*Stress urinary incontinence occurs as a result of reduced urethral resistance: sphincter insufficiency and/or urethral hypermobility (in women only).
*Urge urinary incontinence is most often due to detrusor overactivity, but not always. Detrusor overactivity refers to the occurrence of involuntary detrusor contraction during bladder filling, which can only be diagnosed by urodynamic testing (figure 2). It should be distinguished from overactive bladder, which is a purely clinical diagnosis.
