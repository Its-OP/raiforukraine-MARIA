- CP evolves over many years.

- The ''initial stage'' is marked by the onset of ''pain'', associated with attacks of acute pancreatitis, acute complications and chronic pain.

- After several years, the pain gradually disappears and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (maldigestion diarrhoea with steatorrhoea) and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes) appear.

- Over time, chronic complications increase in frequency (pseudocysts and compression of the digestive tract, veins and main bile duct).

- In the late stage, it is common for only diabetes or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency to persist.
