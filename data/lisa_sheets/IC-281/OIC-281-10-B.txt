● '''Stopping alcohol consumption and smoking''': stopping alcohol consumption often allows pain to disappear

● '''Pain treatment''', complex and multidisciplinary (recourse to pain specialists). Morphine is frequently used, but level 1 (paracetamol) or 2 (tramadol, paracetamol-codeine combination) analgesics may be sufficient. NSAIDs and neuropathic analgesics (e.g. pregabalin) may also be useful.

● Treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency with pancreatic extracts, in cases of weight loss or steatorrhea. Pancreatic extracts are taken in the middle of the meal so that they can be mixed with the food bolus and be more effective.

● Specific treatment for diabetes, no different from other causes of diabetes

● Treatment of other complications

- Treatment of undernutrition

- Drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts: echo-endoscopic drainage in the first instance, surgery is very rarely necessary in the event of failure (resection or bypass).

- Treatment of biliopancreatic stenosis by endoscopic prosthesis, more rarely by surgical resection or bypass.
