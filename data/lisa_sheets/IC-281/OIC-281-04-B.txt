It is necessary to know '''more causes''' than the 2 causes indicated in the title of the question. These are the same as for acute pancreatitis (see item 358).

- Obstructive CP is associated with benign or malignant obstruction of the pancreatic ducts: slowly progressing tumours (TIPMP, TNE), post-traumatic stenosis of the duct of Wirsung, sequelae of acute pancreatitis, congenital anomaly, etc.

- Autoimmune pancreatitis, sometimes associated with other dysimmune diseases (chronic inflammatory bowel disease, IgG4 cholangitis).

- Genetic pancreatitis in which several genes may be involved

- Chronic hypercalcaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia are extremely rare causes of CP.

- In around 10% of cases, no cause is identified.
