- More than 80% of CPs are linked to "excessive alcohol consumption" for more than 10 years, usually in excess of 100g per day. However, less than 5% of heavy drinkers will develop CP.

The main independent risk factor for CP is "smoking", which is associated with more than 80% of cases of alcohol-related CP.  It is also a negative factor that worsens the course of the disease.
