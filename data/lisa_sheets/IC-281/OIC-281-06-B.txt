- '''Acute pancreatitis'''

the main cause of alcohol-related chronic pancreatitis (see Item 358).

- '''Necrotic collections and pseudocysts'''

These 2 types of collection are common, and occur by different mechanisms: liquefaction of necrosis (necrotic collections), or collections of pancreatic fluid (pseudocysts). They may form in the aftermath of an acute attack (necrosis) or as a result of ductal retention (clear fluid).

The evolution is stabilisation, regression or complications: superinfection, compression of a neighbouring organ (portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, common bile duct, digestive tract), haemorrhage linked to a pseudoaneurysm, or rupture in a neighbouring organ (pleurisy) or in the peritoneal cavity (pancreatic ascites).

- Biliary complications

Stenosis of the main bile duct in the pancreatic head results from pericanal fibrosis, pancreatic inflammation or extrinsic compression by a collection (see above). It manifests itself as clinical cholestasis (jaundice, pruritus rarely) and biological cholestasis (increased LAP and GGT, sometimes bilirubin).

- '''Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI)'''

A late complication, associated with steatorrhea and weight loss, it is confirmed by a lowered faecal elastase assay on a stool sample.

- Diabetes secondary to pancreatic endocrine insufficiency

A frequent late complication, diabetes is initially non-insulin-requiring and then requires insulin.


- '''Denutrition'''

Multiple sclerosis exposes the patient to overall malnutrition in nutrients, vitamins (fat-soluble A, D and K, as well as B vitamins including B12 and B9) and trace elements (calcium, zinc and selenium). CP increases the risk of osteoporosis.

- '''Degeneration'''

CP is a moderate risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This risk is low and does not justify specific screening.
