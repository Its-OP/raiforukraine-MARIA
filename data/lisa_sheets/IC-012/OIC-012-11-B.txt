o '''[[Specific features of female genital mutilation 2C-011-DP-B01|Female genital mutilation]]''''

In France, 125,000 adult women are thought to have been sexually mutilated<ref>https://www.has-sante.fr/jcms/p_3150640/fr/prise-en-charge-des-mutilations-sexuelles-feminines-par-les-professionnels-de-sante-de-premier-recours#toc_1_1_2</ref>. Any genital abnormality should therefore be systematically brought to mind and discussed with patients. Any finding of female genital mutilation (FGM) in a minor should be reported.

In order to identify FSM, it is important to be familiar with the normal anatomy of the female external genitalia (Figure 8). The examination should be meticulous, in particular by reclining the clitoral bonnet to ensure the integrity of the clitoris.

There is a classification of FSM according to the type of mutilation, proposed by the World Health Organisation<ref>https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/fr/</ref> :

Type I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or prepuce (clitoridectomy):

        -Type I A: Removal of the clitoral bonnet or prepuce only (Iconography 9),

-Type I B: removal of the clitoris and prepuce (Iconography 9),

Type II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora:

        -Type II A: removal of the labia minora only,

        -Type II B: partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora (Iconography 9),

        -Type II C: partial or total removal of the clitoris, labia minora and labia majora,

'''-Type III''': Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with covering by removal and approximation of the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation):

        -Type III A: removal and apposition of the labia minora,

        -Type III B: removal and apposition of the labia majora,

Type IV: All other harmful procedures performed on the female genital organs for non-therapeutic purposes, such as puncture, piercing, incision, scarification and cauterisation.


o '''Male genital mutilation''''

The main form of male genital mutilation is circumcision. This practice is highly controversial. The one and only justifiable practice is medical in [[Prepucial infections, phimosis and paraphimosis: diagnosis 2C-050-DP-A05|the case of phimosis or para-phimosis]].
