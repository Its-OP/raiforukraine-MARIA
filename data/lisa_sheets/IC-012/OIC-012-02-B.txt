The most recent epidemiological data (excluding judicial data) in mainland France come from the Violence and Gender Relations survey ([https://virage.site.ined.fr/ Virage]), carried out by telephone in 2015 on a sample of 27,000 people aged between 20 and 69. Iconography 1 shows the proportions of sexual violence estimated by the Virage survey.

'''<u>To remember</u>''':

o '''14.5% of women say they have been victims of sexual violence in their lifetime (excluding harassment and exhibitionism), including 3.3% of rape.'''

o '''3.9% of men report having been victims of sexual violence in their lifetime (excluding harassment and exhibitionism), including 0.5% of rape.'''

Whatever the sex of the victim, the majority of reported rapes were committed by 'family and close friends' (excluding couples). Other sexual assaults were mostly committed by strangers in public spaces.

The [https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/organizations/observatoire-national-de-la-delinquance-et-des-reponses-penales-ondrp/ judicial epidemiological data] (Iconographies 2 and 3) represent only a small percentage of sexual violence. '''It is estimated that in the case of sexual violence (outside of relationships), only 15% of victims file a complaint'' (2014-2018 data, from the "living environment and security" survey<ref>https://www.cnis.fr/enquetes/enquete-cadre-de-vie-et-securite-cvs-2021-2021a045ec/</ref>).

<u>'''Á retenir'''</u> ''':''''

o Rape victims are predominantly '''young women, aged between 10 and 24'', although all age and gender categories are affected (Iconography 2).<br />o Those indicted for acts of sexual violence are '''predominantly young men'' (Iconography 3).
