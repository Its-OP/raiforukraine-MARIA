o '''<u>Sexual consent</u>''': '''explicit, free, informed, and mutual agreement''' during sexual activity, whatever its nature.

- Explicit: orally or through behaviour, silence is not equivalent to consent;

- Free: free from any constraint, whether physical or moral;

- Informed: given by a person in a position to understand the situation, whose judgement is not impaired by the use of psychoactive substances, for example;

- Mutual: all participants in the sexual activity must consent.

'''This consent may be withdrawn at any time.'''


o '''<u>Sexual violence</u>''': ''Any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, comment or advances of a sexual nature, or acts aimed at trafficking or otherwise directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, committed by a person regardless of their relationship with the victim, in any context, including, but not limited to, the home and the workplace'' (World Health Organisation definition)<ref>https://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/chap6fr.pdf</ref>.

This definition includes all situations of sexual violence".

More specifically, we can define :

'''-Exhibition sexuelle''' : Fait d'imposer à la vue d'autrui, dans un lieu accessible aux regards du public, une partie dénudée du corps ou la commission explicite d'un acte sexuel, réel ou simulé (Code Pénal, Art. 222-32<ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000043409377</ref>). Sexual exhibition is an offence.

Sexual harassment: the act of repeatedly imposing on a person comments or behaviour with sexual or sexist connotations that either violate their dignity because of their degrading or humiliating nature, or create an intimidating, hostile or offensive situation for them (Code Pénal, Art. 222-33<ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000037289662/</ref>). Sexual harassment is an offence.

-Atteinte sexuelle'': No definition in French legislation. Sexual offences include any behaviour related to sexual activity (with or without penetration or oral sex).

-Sexual assault'': Any sexual assault committed with violence, coercion (physical or moral), threat or surprise, whatever the nature of the relationship between the assailant and the victim, including if they are married (adapted from : Penal Code, Art. 222-22<ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000043409030/</ref>). Sexual assault excludes acts of penetration and oral acts, in which case it is considered rape. Sexual assault is an offence.

-Rape: Any act of sexual penetration of any kind whatsoever or any oral-genital act committed against another person or against the perpetrator by violence, coercion, threat or surprise is rape (French Penal Code, Art. 222-23<ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000043409305/</ref>). Rape is a crime.


o '''<u>Different types of sexual acts</u>:''''

-Attouchement'': contact of a sexual nature without penetration.

-Oral-genital act'': sexual practice during which one person's mouth comes into contact with another person's sexual organs (cunnilingus, anilingus and oral penetration).

-Buccal penetration: the movement by which a body (whatever it is: penis, finger, object) penetrates inside the mouth. The term ''fellatio'' is usually defined as oral penile penetration.

-Vaginal penetration'': movement by which a body (whatever it is: penis, finger, object) penetrates inside the vagina.

-Anal penetration'': movement by which a body (whatever it is: penis, finger, object) penetrates inside the anus. The term ''sodomy'' is usually defined as penile anal penetration.
