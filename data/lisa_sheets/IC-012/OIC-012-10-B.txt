o '''Associated integumentary lesions'''

'''-[[To know and identify the elementary traumatic lesions of forensic medicine and know how to differentiate them 2C-013-DE-B02|Elementary lesions of the skin covering]]:''''

Areas to be examined in particular:

▫ Defence zones: inner edge of forearms, hands ;

▫ Manual grip/grip areas: wrists, shoulders, inner arms, hips ;

▫ Spreading manoeuvre areas: inner side of lower limbs, particularly thighs;

▫ Areas with strong sexual connotations: mouth, breasts, pubis and vulva, buttocks ;

Lesions that are suggestive of bites, for example (Figure 6).





Genital lesions

We look for genital lesions, which are usually concentrated around the posterior fork in women. Hymenal lesions are not systematically found, even in cases of first vaginal penetration. Figure 7 shows a recent tear in the hymen.





o '''[[Identify the psychological impact of violence, particularly in cases of domestic violence 2C-013-DP-B01|Associated psychological damage]]''''

In the aftermath of a sexual assault, particular attention must be paid to a [[Suicidal risk 2C-066-IU-A01|potential suicidal risk]] and to identifying risk factors.
