'''It is estimated that regarding sexual violence in the context of married life, only 11% of individual victims file a complaint''' (2014-2018 data, from the "living environment and security"<ref>https://www.cnis.fr/enquetes/enquete-cadre-de-vie-et-securite-cvs-2021-2021a045ec/</ref> survey). Sexual violence within relationships is therefore probably under-reported, as some victims do not perceive it as rape.

For a long time, French law presumed consent between spouses, and it was not until the Act of 4 April 2006 that the Criminal Code stated that "the presumption of consent of spouses to the sexual act is valid only until proven otherwise". Since the law of 9 July 2010, it has been stated that "Rape and other sexual assaults are constituted when they have been imposed on the victim (...) ''regardless of the nature of the relationship between the assailant and the victim'', including if they are married'' (Art. 222-22 of the Criminal Code). The fact that a rape is marital (spouse, cohabitee, partner bound to the victim by a civil solidarity pact) constitutes "an aggravating circumstance" <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000043409300</ref> to it (Art. 222-24 of the Penal Code).

Marital rape is often "repeated over time". When dealing with any victim of domestic violence, it is essential to address the issue of sexual violence, so that appropriate comprehensive care can be offered (including a check-up for sexually transmitted diseases and psychological care).

In cases of violence (physical or sexual) within a couple, a [[Know the definition of a judicial report and a judicial requisition 2C-012-DE-B02|signalement judiciaire]] '''may be carried out with the consent of the adult victim and must be carried out if the victim is a minor'' (by endeavouring to obtain the victim's consent). In addition, the law of 30 July 2020 <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000042176652</ref> allows the doctor to [[Know which situations require a judicial report, particularly concerning domestic violence 2C-013-IU-A02|report a victim of domestic violence who is an adult]], without the victim's consent but by informing her, if three cumulative conditions are met: to endeavour to obtain the victim's consent ''and'' the violence puts the victim's life at immediate risk ''and'' the victim is under the control of the perpetrator of the violence.
