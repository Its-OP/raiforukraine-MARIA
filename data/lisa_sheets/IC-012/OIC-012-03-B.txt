Sexual exhibition, sexual harassment and sexual assault are criminal offences.

Rape is a crime.

The penalties incurred are set out in the Criminal Code. They may be increased in a number of situations, particularly where there are aggravating circumstances (e.g. committed by an ascendant, on a minor under 15 years of age, by a person abusing his or her authority, with the use or threat of a weapon, by a spouse, by a person in a state of intoxication, on a person engaging in prostitution, etc.).
