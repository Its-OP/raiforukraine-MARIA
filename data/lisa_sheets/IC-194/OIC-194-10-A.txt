=='''AAN = orientation test'''==
'''Presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA)'''' '''constant during LS.''''

'''D'''epistage by indirect immunofluorescence on Hep2 cells ('''positivity threshold: titre ≥ 1/160''').

''Non-specific for LS'': may be present in other autoimmune diseases, in healthy subjects in particular if they are elderly.


N.B.: The classification criteria for LS (which are not diagnostic criteria, but are used in clinical studies to exclude patients without LS), set the threshold of the AAN titre <1/80 to exclude the diagnosis of LS (and not 1/160), in association with other clinical and biological criteria.

==Identification of the NAA target ==

* anti-native DNA antibodies, highly suggestive of LS
* antibodies specific for soluble nuclear antigens (''extractable nuclear antigen,'' ENA) or calf thymus extract (''thymus cell extract,'' ECT). These include anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies (Sjögren's syndrome, LS); anti-Sm is highly specific for LS but less sensitive (30%).
