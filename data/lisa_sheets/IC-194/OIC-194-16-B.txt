- Thrombotic APAS = '''anticoagulation for the most part for life'' (heparin for recent thrombosis followed by long-term treatment (for life) with '''anti-vitamin K''').

- Direct oral anticoagulants = not used in the treatment of APS as they are associated with an excess risk of thrombosis.

- Obstetrical APS = during '''pregnancies''' '''combination of subcutaneous heparin and acetylsalicylic acid'''.
