Skin biopsy is not systematic.

In case of clinical doubt (''interpretation of a pathology report''): skin biopsy.

2 punch biopsies are taken for fixed samples and fresh samples for immunofluorescence.

'''<u>Fixed sample</u>''': alteration with vacuolisation of the basal layer; orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis of the epidermis; keratinocytic necrosis of the dermis; oedema by vasodilatation of the capillaries with lymphocytic infiltrate around the appendages and perivascular.

'''<u>Fresh sample</u>''' (direct immunofluorescence): sensitive, lupus band made up of deposits of immunoglobulins and linear complement fractions at the dermo-epidermal junction.
