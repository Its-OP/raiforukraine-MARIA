'''Dermatological manifestations (80% of LS): predominate in exposed areas'' (photosensitivity).

- '''Acute lupus''': erythematous rash ('''erythema''') on the face in symmetrical '''vespertilio''' on the nose and cheekbones, sometimes décolleté, fingers, mucous membranes (oral erosion)

- '''Lupus subaiguus''': annular or polycyclic, photosensitive eruption ('''erythema''') of the décolleté, trunk and limbs, excluding the face. Often associated with the presence of an anti-SS-A antibody.

- Chronic lupus: for example, discoid lupus: well-limited patches combining erythema, thick scales and scar atrophy (with patchy alopecia if scalp)

- Diffuse alopecia ''(alopecia and hair loss)'': sign of activity
