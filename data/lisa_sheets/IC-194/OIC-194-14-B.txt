=='''LS follow-up'''==
- clinical examination

- biological tests: haemogram, ionogram, creatinine, albumin, regular search for proteinuria, haematuria, serum complement and anti-native DNA antibody assays (disease activity), hydroxychloroquine assay (evaluation of self-adherence).
<br />

Prognostic visceral damage =='''Prognostic visceral damage'''==
- Renal: certain forms of renal damage are serious because they threaten both vital and renal prognosis (risk of chronic renal failure): class III and IV lupus nephropathies with active lesions are serious (they require treatment), as are class V with nephrotic syndrome. Classes I and II are benign (do not require treatment).

- neurological

- myocarditis

- cytopenias
