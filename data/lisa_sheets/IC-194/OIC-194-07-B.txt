'''Diagnosis of SAPL = presence of at least one clinical criterion AND at least one biological criterion.'''

== '''Clinical criteria''' ==
A single criterion is sufficient

- '''Venous, arterial or microcirculation thrombosis''' '''(management of a patient suspected of having thrombophilia)'''; except for superficial thrombosis.

- ''Obstetric manifestations'': at least 3 spontaneous, consecutive early miscarriages (before 10 weeks' amenorrhoea (SA)), with no other cause identified, or at least one foetal death ''in utero'' (> 10 SA) or at least one unexplained prematurity (''difficulty in procreating'').

== Biological criteria ==
Persistent presence (on at least two occasions at least 12 weeks apart) of at least one autoantibody detected by various techniques (one is sufficient). These may include :

- ''high titre IgG or IgM isotype anti-cardiolipin antibodies'' (ELISA technique).

- ''high titre IgG or IgM isotype anti-beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies'' (ELISA technique)

- Identification of a circulating anticoagulant by haemostasis tests before heparin treatment: isolated APTT prolongation (normal prothrombin rate), uncorrected when patient plasma is mixed with control plasma (eliminates a coagulation factor deficiency), corrected by an excess of phospholipids (neutralisation: adsorption of anti-phospholipid antibodies).

== Non-classifying clinical or laboratory manifestations of APAS ==
- Cardiac: mitral or aortic valve disease with diffuse or localised thickening (''Libman-Sacks endocarditis'').

- Cutaneous: ''livedo'' (dark erythematous, or blue-purple, net-like discolouration of the skin).

- Renal: thrombosis of the intra-renal arteries

- Thrombocytopenia
