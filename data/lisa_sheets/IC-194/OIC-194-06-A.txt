==Renal manifestations = 40% of LS ==
Often at the beginning of the disease

==Major prognostic importance ==
Urine dipstick screening ('''[[SDD-182|urine dipstick analysis]]''''): to be done regularly during follow-up to identify '''[[Proteinuria SDD-212|proteinuria]]'''.

Possible presentations:

*asymptomatic
*isolated proteinuria
*nephrotic syndrome
*renal insufficiency of variable degree (''increased creatinine'') with ''proteinuria'' and often ''haematuria'' (''urinary sediment analysis'')
*rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis syndrome: oedema, proteinuria, haematuria, even arterial hypertension in adults and children and acute renal failure.

Analysis of the renal biopsy essential (''interpretation of an anatomopathology report'') to diagnose and classify the type of lupus nephropathy (prognostic and therapeutic implications).
