'''CRP (elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP))''' not very high during attacks of LS, except for seritis, infection or thrombosis ('''acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome'').

'''Haemogram''': '''cytopenias (interpretation of the haemogram)''', most often of autoimmune origin: '''anaemia (drop in haemoglobin''') autoimmune haemolytic, '''thrombocytopenia''' immunological ('''platelet abnormality''') responsible for haemorrhagic syndrome primarily cutaneous ('''purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma'''), '''leucopenia''' moderate which may correspond to neutropenia and/or lymphopenia ('''leucocyte abnormality''). 

'''Haemostasis''': '''prolongation of''' '''activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)''' in the presence of a lupus-type circulating anticoagulant.

'''Créatininémie''': '''élévation de la créatininémie''' in cases of kidney damage.

Hypoalbuminemia

''Hypocomplementaemia'' (decrease in CH50, C3 and C4 fractions) often observed during attacks of LS.

'''Urinary tests:''' '''proteinuria''' '''> 0.5 g/g creatininuria''' ('''or > 500 mg per 24 h)''', microscopic '''haematuria''' ('''urinary sediment analysis''').
