Systemic lupus (SL) = a systemic autoimmune disease of heterogeneous presentation and prognosis, characterised by the production of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) directed in particular against native DNA.

LS is sometimes associated with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS), characterised by the occurrence of recurrent thrombosis or obstetric events, and the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies.
