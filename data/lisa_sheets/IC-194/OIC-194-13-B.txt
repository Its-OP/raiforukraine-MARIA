Percutaneous or trans-jugular renal biopsy indicated in cases of ''proteinuria greater than 0.5 g/g creatinine (or 0.5 g per 24 hours) and/or renal failure'' (unless contraindicated).

Predominant disorders: ''glomerulonephritis'' (interstitial and vascular disorders less common)


Light microscopy analysis to determine the stage of glomerulonephritis and whether lesions are active or chronic.

Direct immunofluorescence analysis: deposits of immunoglobulins of all classes and complement

Class I: normal appearance of glomeruli under light microscopy but mesangial immune deposits in immunoflurescence

Class II: mesangial hyperplasia (light microscopy) + immunoflurescent mesangial immune deposits

Classes III and IV: endo- and/or extra-capillary hypercellularity and/or immune deposits in the glomerular capillaries in less than 50% and 50% or more of the glomeruli respectively.

Class V: may be associated with classes II, III or IV; extra-membranous immune deposits


Class VI: predominance of glomeruli (over 90%) made of sealing bread (fibrous): kidney destroyed by lupus nephropathy
