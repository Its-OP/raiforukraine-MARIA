Cardiac ultrasound is the gold standard. This test should be carried out immediately by a paediatric cardiologist in the event of a murmur associated with heart failure in an infant or newborn.


Chest X-rays are no longer appropriate for this indication. Carried out for another reason, it may point to heart disease by revealing cardiomegaly.
