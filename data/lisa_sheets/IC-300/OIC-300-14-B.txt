==Abdominal and endovaginal ultrasound with Doppler==
[[File:UntitledUterus.png|vignette|Conduit à tenir en cas de métrorragies post ménopausiques]]
Ultrasound measurement of the uterine cavity is best performed transabdominally. If the thickness of the endometrial mucosa is less than 4 mm, the likelihood of cancer is very low. The negative predictive value (NPV) of this sign is very good; on the other hand, the positive predictive value is low, which is why ultrasound alone is not a good screening test for endometrial cancer. However, in a non-menopausal patient, a uterine mucosa thicker than 8 mm is abnormal and should prompt further investigations.

==Pelvic MRI
MRI is an essential examination for determining the stage of endometrial cancer preoperatively. It can be used to locate and measure the lesion, to determine the depth of myometrial invasion and the extent of the tumour towards the cervix or adnexa. It is also one of the most effective tests for detecting lymph node involvement.

==Search for metastases==
If the tumour appears to be advanced (FIGO stage III or above), or if it is a histological type 2 lesion, a more extensive extension work-up may be carried out before the operation. This includes a TAP (thoraco-abdomino-pelvic) scan or a PET scan.
