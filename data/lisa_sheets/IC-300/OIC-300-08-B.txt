The diagnosis of a pre-cancerous lesion or cervical cancer requires histological evidence, obtained by biopsy.

In the case of a macroscopically abnormal cervix, the smear is no longer of interest, as false-negative smears are common in these advanced forms. The smear is a screening test, not a diagnostic test. In these cases, a sample should be taken immediately for anatomopathological examination, either by :

- cervical biopsies centred on lesion areas and carried out if necessary under colposcopic guidance

- conization, particularly when biopsy under colposcopy is not feasible (squamocolumnar junction zone cannot be visualized)

In the case of invasive cancer, imaging tests are used to assess tumour volume, extension beyond the cervix, lymph node extension and distant extension:

- Pre-therapeutic pelvic MRI (starting at the renal pedicles and extending to the pubic symphysis) is the reference examination, and has replaced the examination under general anaesthetic.

This examination makes it possible to assess :

- tumour volume (measurement of the largest diameter),

- extension beyond the collar (in particular to the parameters)

- lymph node involvement (pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes)

- search for dilatation of the pyelocalic cavities

- 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET-CT) is proposed for remote assessment of extension and lymph node involvement

- cystoscopy and/or rectoscopy may be performed if there is any doubt on MRI about rectal or bladder extension
