=== In asymptomatic forms ===
the cervix appears normal or has only a small red area. In this case, colposcopy is required. The vaginal touch is not informative in this case.

=== In the symptomatic form ===
examination with the naked eye reveals one of the classic macroscopic aspects:

- budding forms, which vary in size. They are fragile and bleed readily on contact with the skin.

- ulcerated, irregular forms, often necrotic with a crater-like appearance. The vaginal touch notes three signs: the lesion is painless, rests on an indurated base and bleeds on contact.

=== In certain situations ===
clinical diagnosis is more difficult:

- endocervical cancer. The cervix may appear normal but is often large and barrel-shaped, and may bleed when the cervix is expressed between the speculum valves.

- cervical cancer on the remaining cervix, which is becoming increasingly rare as subtotal hysterectomy is only performed in the absence of oncogenic HPV carriage

- cancer in pregnant women. Breakthrough bleeding is early and abundant, and risks being trivialised because of the frequency of breakthrough bleeding during pregnancy. It's worth bearing this in mind, and remembering that for many women pregnancy is the only time they will see a doctor: smear screening should be carried out during pregnancy for women who have not had a smear test in the last 3 years.

=== In advanced forms ===
The clinical examination includes :

- Unfolding of the vaginal walls using a speculum to look for extension at this level.

- a vaginal touch to assess the volume and mobility of the cervix and the suppleness of the vaginal pouches

- a rectal examination to assess the presence of infiltration of the parameters

- a combined touch to assess any posterior extension to the recto-vaginal septum.
