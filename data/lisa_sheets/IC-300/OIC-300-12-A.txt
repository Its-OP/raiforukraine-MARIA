==Fortuitous discovery==


On hysterectomy specimen for presumed benign pathology of the uterus.

Additional examination carried out for another pathology (ultrasound, MRI, CT scan, FDG-PET).

An AGC smear may be indicative of endometrial cancer. Therefore, in women over the age of 45, in addition to colposcopic investigation, endo-uterine investigation is recommended (pelvic ultrasound and endometrial biopsy).
