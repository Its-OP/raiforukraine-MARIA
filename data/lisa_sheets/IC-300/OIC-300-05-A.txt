Adult cancer prevention/screening SD-303|'''dépistage''']] is currently observed by only 60% of women. The introduction of organised screening is intended to increase compliance.

From the age of 25 until the age of 65, all women, whether vaccinated or not, should continue to be screened for cervical cancer. From the age of 25, women are recommended to undergo a Pap smear, which should be repeated at 1 year if the result is normal. Adult cancer prevention/screening SD-303|screening]'' is then continued every 3 years by UHC until the age of 30.  From the age of 30 until the age of 65, the HPV test replaces the cytological examination, in primary [[Prevention/screening of adult cancers SD-303|'''dépistage''']] of cervical cancer: 3 years after the last cytological examination with a normal result or from the age of 30 in the absence of a previous cytological examination. The interval between two HPV tests is 5 years, provided the test result is negative. An annual clinical examination using a speculum is recommended between screenings.

The FCU is the reference method for [[Prevention/screening of adult cancers SD-303|'''dépistage''']] cervical cancer. It is a non-invasive test that is easy to perform at low cost.  It has excellent specificity (>95%) but low sensitivity (55-77%). The pre-cancerous period is long, and repeated smears over time can still provide good diagnostic efficacy. In fact, having a smear every 3 years reduces the risk of cervical cancer by 90%. Depending on the results of the Pap smear, various steps are indicated (Table).
