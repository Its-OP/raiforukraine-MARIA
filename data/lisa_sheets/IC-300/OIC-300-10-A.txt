The main cause of endometrial cancer is oestrogen exposure which is not, or is poorly, compensated for by a progestin sequence:

- oestrogen treatment alone

- tamoxifen treatment

- ''[[Obesity and overweight SD-051|obesity]]'' android

- '''[[Hypertension SD-042|hypertension]]''''

- diabetes

- precocious puberty

- '''[[Follow-up consultation of a menopausal woman SD-278|menopause]]''' late menopause with prolonged perimenopausal period

- polycystic ovaries

- poverty


Genetically, Lynch II syndromes have been described in which endometrial cancers are represented.

The protective factors for endometrial cancer are: use of oestroprogestogenic "contraception", "contraception" using a 52 mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device, multiparity (≥4 pregnancies), and late puberty (≥15 years).
