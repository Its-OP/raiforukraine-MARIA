Ophthalmological damage = risk of blindness.

Look for prodromal signs:

- Amaurosis '''([[Anomaly of vision SD-138|anomaly of vision]])''': transient loss of vision, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes, complete or simple amputation of the visual field.

- Transient ''[[Diplopia SD-143|Diplopia]]''' secondary to oculomotor paralysis.
