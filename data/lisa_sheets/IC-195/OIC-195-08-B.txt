== '''Reference examination = temporal artery biopsy (TAB)''' ==


Normal in about 1/3 of cases.


In other cases: '''inflammatory reaction''' ('''[[Interpretation of a pathology report SD-180|interpretation of a pathology report]],''' ''[[Inflammatory reaction on surgical specimen/biopsy SD-179|inflammatory reaction on biopsy]]'''):

- inflammatory infiltrate with mononuclear cells (lymphocytes, macrophages) in the three tunics of the artery (panarteritis)

- inconsistent mononuclear giant cells

- fragmentation of the internal elastic boundary

- intimal hyperplasia responsible for stenosis or even vascular occlusion.

- absence of fibrinoid necrosis.


== '''Temporal artery imaging''' ==
Echo-Doppler of the temporal arteries to look for hypoechoic thickening of the temporal artery wall (halo sign).

Need for a trained operator.

== Imaging of the aorta and large vessels ==
- Echo-Doppler: looks for the halo sign in the arteries of the limbs, as in the case of the temporal artery. The aorta cannot be studied.

- Angiomodensitometry (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRI): to identify circumferential and homogeneous thickening of the vascular wall

- 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT: to identify vascular wall hypermetabolism
