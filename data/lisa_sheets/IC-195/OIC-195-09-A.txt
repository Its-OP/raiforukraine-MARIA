Corticosteroid therapy ('''[[Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SD-251|prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids]])''' = cornerstone of CAG treatment.

Must be started as a matter of urgency to avoid ischaemic complications (particularly ophthalmological).

Initial treatment, then tapering off.

Measures associated with corticosteroid therapy (see section on prescribing corticosteroids)

Withdrawal in about 18 months.

Regular clinical and biological monitoring for at least the duration of treatment.


In the event of a relapse :

- methotrexate (without marketing authorisation)

- tocilizumab (anti-interleukin 6 receptor monoclonal antibody) (which has marketing authorisation for this indication).


Acetylsalicylic acid in anti-aggregation doses may be used (always in the event of ischaemic complications, to be discussed in other cases).


Prediction dominated by :

* the risk of visual sequelae
* the undesirable effects of prolonged corticosteroid therapy;
* vascular complications (aneurysm, dilatation of the aorta)
* complications of atheroma.
