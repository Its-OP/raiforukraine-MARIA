- Vascular imaging (echo-Doppler, angio-CT, angio-MRI, PET-scanner) = diagnostic role and follow-up

- Histology '''([[Interpretation of a pathology report SD-180|interpretation of a pathology report]])'''' = signs similar to those of CAG '''([[Inflammatory reaction on surgical specimen/biopsy SD-179|inflammatory reaction on biopsy]])'''. In most cases, however, no arterial biopsy sample is available. No TAO (temporal artery rarely involved).
