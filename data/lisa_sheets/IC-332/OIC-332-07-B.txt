A distinction is made between

1°) Biological tests. The aim is to confirm the haemorrhage, quantify the blood loss and assess its severity.

This is how it works:

- CBC-platelets

- Arterial GDS with lactataemia

- Haemostasis: PT, APTT, fibrinogen, ionised calcium

- Group ABO-Rh


2°) Etiological examinations :

1.      External haemorrhage

o Haematemesis, melena, rectal discharge: FOGD+/-rectosigmoidioscopy

o Vascular wound/traumatic wound: external compression/twist and call the surgeon

o Gynaeco-obstetric haemorrhage: under-valve examination, uterine revision

2.      Non-external haemorrhage

o Traumatic context: FAST-echo, chest x-ray, pelvic x-ray +/- injected thoraco-abdominal-pelvic CT scan

o Non-trauma: injected thoraco-abdomino-pelvic scan
