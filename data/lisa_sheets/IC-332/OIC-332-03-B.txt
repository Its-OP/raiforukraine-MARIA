In the initial phase of septic shock, cardiac output may be elevated as a result of cardiac hyperkinesia due to vasoplegia.

In obstructive shock secondary to pulmonary embolism, it is the afterload of the right heart that is increased. Preload falls as a result of reduced venous return in pericardial tamponade and compressive pneumothorax. This is known as "pump deflation".

An increase in systemic vascular resistance can be understood as vasoconstriction, and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance as vasodilation.
