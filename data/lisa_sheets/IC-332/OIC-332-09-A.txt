Step 1: Condition monitoring and venous lines (see elements of immediate management of a state of shock)

Step 2: Identify the cause of the haemorrhage and control the bleeding

- Compression points/grips/sutures

- Call to visceral/obstetric/trauma surgeon or gastroenterologist for specialist haemostasis procedure depending on cause of bleeding

Stage 3: Initial symptomatic measures

- Prevent and, if necessary, correct hypothermia

- Vascular filling with crystalloids +/- vasopressor amines in the absence of response to volume expansion

- Blood transfusion

o If immediate viral emergency without blood group: O+ transfusion. O- in women of childbearing age

o Ratio of packed red blood cells to fresh frozen plasma between 1:1 and 1:2

- Correction of haemostasis disorders

o Vit K if AVK

o Coagulation factor/prothrombin complex concentrates if oral anticoagulants

o Correction of hypocalcaemia

o Fresh frozen plasma/fibrinogen depending on coagulation disorders

- Tranexamic acid: an antifibrinolytic to be administered early
