The diagnosis of shock is clinical and is based on the following elements:

1°) arterial hypotension, defined as :

- PAS<90 mmHg

- MAP<65 mmHg

- Variation of more than 30% in chronically hypertensive patients

/Blood pressure may be normal in the initial phase of shock, even though cellular damage has already begun. Importance of lactataemia +++

/Tachycardia precedes arterial hypotension in haemorrhagic shock and hypovolaemic shock. This is a clinical point of attention.

2°) signs of peripheral hypoperfusion :

- Asthenia

- Marbling, particularly on the knees. Correlated with gravity

- Polypnoea >22 cycles/min

- Skin recolouration time > 3s

- Confusion, agitation

- Oliguria
