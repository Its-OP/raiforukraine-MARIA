Diagnosis

This is a clinical diagnosis based on

- PAS<90 mmHg or MAP<65 mmHg or variation of more than 30% compared with the patient's usual figures.

Reactive tachycardia is usually present.

B/ Clinical signs of peripheral hypoperfusion

- Polypnoea > 22 cycles/min

- Mottling

- Longer skin recolouring time

- Confusion
