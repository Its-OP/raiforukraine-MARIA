A distinction is made between :

- Examinations to assess severity

o Venous arterial lactates

o Arterial blood gases: hypoxaemia/acidosis

o Liver function tests: liver shock

o CBC-coagulation: intensity of polynucleosis and lymphopenia, also of orientation value/CIVD

o Blood ionogram and creatinine

- Diagnostic or pre-therapeutic examinations

o ECG

o Chest X-ray and other imaging according to clinical findings

o CBC

o Pair of blood cultures and other microbiological samples according to clinical signs, unless there is an obvious alternative diagnosis

o ABO-Rhesus group

- Examinations to characterise the haemodynamic profile

o Specialist assessment in the intensive care sector, including cardiac echography
