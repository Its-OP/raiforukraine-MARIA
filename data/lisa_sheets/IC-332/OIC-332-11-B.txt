Step 1: Condition monitoring and venous lines (see elements of immediate management of a state of shock)

Step 2: Identify the cause of cardiogenic shock

- History/clinical examination: see etiological reasoning

Stage 3: Initial symptomatic measures

- Call the resuscitator for non-rapidly reversible symptoms

- If OAP: half-seated position, diuretics +/- non-invasive ventilation +/- dobutamine /!
Do not prescribe hypotensive drugs used in acute heart failure without shock, such as nitrates/calcium antagonists/beta-blockers.

- In the case of isolated right heart failure: cautious filling possible to avoid left heart deflation due to right heart/left heart interaction

- Assess the indication for an inotropic drug=dobutamine, Î²2 mimetic +/- noradrenaline

- Specialist management is usually required, with advanced haemodynamic assessment and monitoring.

Stage 4: measures specific to the aetiology :

- ACS: antiplatelet agents and coronary revascularisation (item 339)

- symptomatic management of a rhythm disorder

- management of cardiotropic drug intoxication: refer to the relevant question (item 337)

- surgical management of valvulopathy or aortic dissection

.  Pulmonary embolism: thrombolysis in the absence of contraindication

.  Pericardial tamponade: pericardial drainage

.  Compressive pneumothorax: pleural drainage
