Anaphylactic shock requires first-line injection of IM adrenaline!

Step 1: Condition monitoring and venous lines (see elements for immediate management of a state of shock)

Stage 2: management of shock

- Avoidance of the allergen

- Injection of adrenaline IM ++.

- Auto-injector pen if available

- Adrenaline ampoule 1mg diluted in 10 mL. Injection 0.01 mg/kg (0.5 mg per 50 kg)

- Location: lateral surface of the middle 1/3 thigh, in the vastus lateralis

- The IV route is possible but should be reserved for trained teams: titration +++ 0.001 mg/kg (10 times less than IM!)

- Repeat every 5 minutes

- Crystalloid volume expansion

Stage 3: Investigation and management of associated respiratory failure

- If respiratory distress: patient in sitting position

- Lower airway obstruction: aerosols of Î²2-mimetics (salbutamol)

- Upper airway obstruction: aerosols of adrenaline (5 mg nebulised)


NB: IV corticosteroid therapy with 1 mg/kg methylprednisolone is not an emergency and is used to prevent relapse. Antihistamines are only effective on mucocutaneous signs.
