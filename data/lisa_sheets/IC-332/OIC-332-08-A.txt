Call for help from colleagues and the resuscitator +++. You can't manage a state of shock on your own!''

Coordination by a leader who distributes roles. There are many tasks to be carried out, and several of them need to be coordinated.

carry out simultaneously

Follow procedure A (Airway: opening the airway), B (Breathing: assessing and managing ventilation) and C (Circulation: assessing and managing circulation).

A distinction is made between :

- Continuous monitoring of vital parameters :

o electrocardioscope

o SpO2

o frequent measurement of blood pressure NIBP

- Initial symptomatic measures :

o Systematic oxygen therapy

o Vascular filling: 500 ml free-flow crystalloids on a good-calibre venous TK (unless left heart failure with PAO) (or 20 ml/kg in children, max 500 ml).

- History-taking and clinical referral data

- Initial etiological measures :

o tourniquet/compression on bleeding

o Antibiotic therapy if septic shock

o inotropic and/or vasoactive support depending on the aetiology

o refer to specific items for details

- Paraclinical assessment of failure according to aetiological orientation
