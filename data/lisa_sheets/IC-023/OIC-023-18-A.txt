From the first to the fifth month of pregnancy, medical and pharmaceutical expenses are reimbursed at the usual Social Security rates.

From the 1st day of the sixth month of pregnancy until twelve days after the birth, maternity insurance covers 100% of all reimbursable medical expenses, whether or not related to the pregnancy, as well as pharmaceutical expenses. The post-natal consultation at 6 to 8 weeks is also covered at 100%.

The length of maternity leave depends on the family situation of the pregnant employee. If the woman is an employee or on unemployment benefit, she can receive daily allowances during her maternity leave, provided she meets the necessary conditions.
