The date of onset of pregnancy is calculated using the ultrasound measurement of craniocaudal length (CCL), which must be taken between 11 and 13 weeks' gestation + 6 days.

In the case of IVF with fresh (not frozen) embryo transfer, the date of the start of pregnancy is defined by the puncture date, which corresponds to the day of fertilisation.

Gestational age in weeks of amenorrhoea is calculated by adding 14 days to the date of the start of pregnancy.

The calculation of the term is based on the date of the start of pregnancy plus 9 months, i.e. 41SA + 0 days.
