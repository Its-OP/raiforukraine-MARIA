==Vomiting ==
Nausea SD-012|naus√©e]], whether or not accompanied by [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], occurs in more than half of pregnant women. With no particular timetable and often persisting throughout the day, these disorders are generally not accompanied by any physical or biological abnormality. They often begin before the 8<sup>th</sup> week of amenorrhoea and disappear spontaneously between the 12<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>th</sup> week.  

==Constipation
Under the effect of progesterone, transit is slowed down, leading to constipation.

==Haemorrhoids ==
Linked to the compression of the pelvic veins by the pregnant uterus. Also favoured after childbirth.

==Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ==
Pyrosis is very common, especially in the 3rd<sup>trimester.

==Cramps
Favoured by urinary magnesium leakage. Sensations of heavy legs are more frequent due to pelvic compression.

==Pain and fever ==
Must be treated. cf [[Knowing the medicinal and non-medicinal measures concerning minor ailments of pregnancy 2C-023-PC-A08]]
