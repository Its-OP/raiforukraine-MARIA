==Biological tests at the time of declaration of pregnancy ==

===Required tests for pregnancy declaration===
Blood group (A, B, O, rhesus phenotypes: box 1, complete and Kell), search for irregular agglutinins,

Serologies: toxoplasmosis, rubella and syphilis, HBs antigen test,

Proteinuria; '''[[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|UB analysis]], [[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''''

===Exams discussed and therefore routinely suggested===
HIV serology 1 and 2,

Prenatal screening for trisomy 21, giving priority to the

Combined 1st trimester screening for trisomy 21 (see next paragraph)

===Tests to suggest depending on the patient===
ECBU: if history of urinary tract infection, diabetes or positive urine dipstick,

'''[[Gestational diabetes screening SD-304|Gestational diabetes screening]]<nowiki/>l (Fasting blood glucose +/- HGPO75: if risk factors for gestational diabetes,'''

Haemogram: if risk factors for anaemia. '''[[Haemoglobin decrease SD-217|Haemoglobin decrease]]'''''

+/- for women from Africa, the West Indies and the Mediterranean basin, a haemoglobinopathy test using haemoglobin electrophoresis may be suggested (thalassaemia, sickle cell anaemia).

RH1 genotyping in Rh D-negative women and RH D-positive spouses

The individual question of verifying CMV serological status can be raised at this point in the consultation with a view to recommending barrier measures.

==Biological tests during pregnancy monitoring ==

==='''Monthly'''===
Proteinuria on sample '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]] and [[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|BU]]''''

Toxoplasmosis serology if the previous result was negative

Rubella serology if the previous result was negative and without vaccination (up to 18 weeks' gestation)

===''At the 6<sup>th</sup> month are added'''===
RAI For rhesus-negative women or women with a history of transfusion

Haemogram ''[[Haemoglobin decrease SD-217|Haemoglobin decrease]]''''

+/ oral induced hyperglycaemia between 24 and 28 days' gestation if there are risk factors for gestational diabetes and T1 fasting blood glucose is normal. '''[[Gestational diabetes screening SD-304|Gestational diabetes screening]]'''''

==='''At the 8th<sup> month</sup> are added'''===
