During the first consultation, the patient '''must''' receive '''information''' on trisomy 21 and the possibility of screening for it by calculating the combined risk of trisomy 21 (decree of 23 June 2009) [[Prenatal screening for trisomy 21 SD-307|'''Prenatal screening for trisomy 21''']]. She signs a consent form if she wishes to undergo the test, having been informed of the possible consequences according to the risk threshold. The calculation is made by combining the measurement of nuchal translucency between 11 and 13 SA + 6 days with a blood test for free Î²-hCG and PAPP-A (''Pregnancy Associated Plasma Protein A'') and maternal age.
