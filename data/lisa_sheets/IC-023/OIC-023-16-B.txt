An individual (EPP) or couple interview is systematically offered to every pregnant woman around the 4<sup>th</sup>month of pregnancy. It may take place earlier or later if the need is expressed. This interview is part of the birth preparation sessions. It is the 1<sup>rst</sup> session in the preparation for birth and parenthood programme, which comprises a total of 8 sessions; the EPP can be carried out by a midwife or doctor trained in this type of interview (lasting 45 minutes).

A birth plan is drawn up by the woman or the couple. This represents the conjunction between the aspirations of the woman and the couple and the care offered by the maternity unit. It includes the organisation of care with medical monitoring and preparation for birth and parenthood, the delivery arrangements, the possibilities for monitoring during the postnatal period, including the conditions for an early return home, and recourse in the event of difficulties.
