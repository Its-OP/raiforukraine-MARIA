Know how to spot complications of pregnancy through questioning (active foetal movements, loss of fluid in a pregnant woman before term SD-109|loss of amniotic fluid), headaches, oedema, phosphene, tinnitus, metrorrhagia, leucorrhoea, uterine contractions, pelvic pain) and clinical examination (uterine height, speculum examination or vaginal touch depending on the functional signs).


Metrorrhagia in the first trimester: (threat of) miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy / In the 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester: Placenta inserted low or retroplacental haematoma = urgent opinion ''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|Genital bleeding during pregnancy]]''''

Gravidic hypertension = PAS ≥ 140 mmHg and/or a PAD≥90 mmHg beyond 20 weeks' amenorrhoea ''[[Hypertension in pregnancy SD-053|HTA in pregnancy]]''''

Gestational diabetes = Fasting blood glucose ≥ 0.92 g/L or 1 pathological value on oral hyperglycaemia test with 75g glucose ''[[Gestational diabetes screening SD-304|Gestational diabetes screening]]'''

Proteinuria = significant if ≥ 0.3g/24h or 30mg/mmol ''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]''''

Oedema = classic sign of late pregnancy in the lower limbs but can be associated with pre-eclampsia especially if it affects the hands and face ''[[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesia SD-073|Pain burning cramps and paresthesia]]'', [[Heavy legs SD-076|Heavy legs]]'''''

CU = considered physiological at the end of the day and if they occur < 10 times a day. Regular and painful, they should prompt a search for a threat of premature delivery ''[[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|Uterine contractions in a pregnant woman]]'''

Small for gestational age/Intrauterine growth restriction: may be suspected on the basis of low uterine height. Diagnosis is by ultrasound

Absence of active movements = urgent consultation after 20SA
