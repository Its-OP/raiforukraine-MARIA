== Four levels of monitoring are defined (HAS): ==
- Follow-up A: when the pregnancy is progressing without any risk situations or when these situations are of a low risk level, regular follow-up may be provided by a midwife or a doctor (general practitioner, medical gynaecologist or obstetrician-gynaecologist, depending on the woman's choice);

- A1 follow-up: the advice of an obstetric gynaecologist and/or another specialist is "recommended";

- A2 follow-up: the opinion of an obstetric gynaecologist is ''necessary''. Additional advice from another specialist may also be required;

- follow-up B: when the level of risk is high, regular follow-up should be provided by an obstetric gynaecologist from the outset.
<br />

== The choice of place of birth ==
It depends on the wishes of the future parents (preferences, place of residence), the risk of pregnancy highlighted by the assessment at the beginning of pregnancy and, above all, the follow-up +++.

Maternity units are classified into types (according to the risk of prematurity) and according to maternal needs:

- No neonatal unit;

- Type II with neonatal unit;

- Type III with neonatal resuscitation unit.

- Distinguishing maternal resuscitation needs from neonatal resuscitation needs
