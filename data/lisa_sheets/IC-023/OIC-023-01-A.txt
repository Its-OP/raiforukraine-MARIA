==Weight development ==
Physiological weight gain - between 11 and 16 kg if Body Mass Index is normal

==Physiological haematological changes ==
Progressive increase in plasma volume, greater than the increase in the mass of red blood cells: ''[[Decrease in haemoglobin SD-217|Decrease in haemoglobin]]''', haematocrit and number of red blood cells (anaemia if haemoglobin (Hb) less than 11 g/dL<sup>8</sup>), hyperleukocytosis.

Increased need for iron, folate and vitamin B12 '''[[Ferritin: decrease or increase SD-207|Ferritin decrease or increase]]''''

Fall in platelet count (thrombocytopenia if less than 100 [jn3] Giga/L.)

Physiological state of hypercoagulability: greater thromboembolic risk during pregnancy, and even greater in the postpartum period.

==Cardiovascular changes
Increase in cardiac output, associated with peripheral vasodilatation.

Blood pressure is reduced in the first and second trimesters, but returns to the same levels as in non-pregnant women in the last trimester.

Venous stasis and dilation are also increased

==Renal changes
Renal blood flow is increased:

Increase in glomerular filtration rate Ãž plasma urea and creatinine levels are reduced in pregnant women

Glycosuria and proteinuria increase[jn4].

==Respiratory changes
Increase in oxygen demand

Respiratory rate increases by 40-50%.

Diaphragmatic elevation at the end of pregnancy reduces functional residual capacity, but preserves vital capacity.

Frequent feeling of being short of air [jn5] without hypoxia

==Digestive changes
Frequent nausea and vomiting in the first trimester. May last longer.

Increased risk and frequency of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

==Endocrine changes
Increase in prolactin

Insulin resistance in the 3rd trimester

Changes in thyroid hormones without clinical consequences<br />.
