- Erysipelas:

This is an acute bacterial dermo-hypodermatitis caused by streptococci, mainly streptococcus pyogenes (rarely beta haemolytic B, C and G), which affects the leg in over 80% of cases. These bacteria are 100% sensitive to penicillin.

It is a common disease, occurring in adults over the age of 40 (with a peak at 60). Lower limb involvement is favoured by venous and/or lymphatic insufficiency.

Local favouring factors: venous insufficiency, intertrigo-type portal of entry, wound, scratching, ulcer, etc.

General contributing factors: obesity, immunodepression, pre-existing skin diseases (eczema, psoriasis, etc.).

- Usual form :

Unilateral acute febrile red leg. The onset is sudden, with a high fever (39-40Â°C) accompanied by chills, which may precede the appearance of the inflammatory patch by several hours.

The lesion takes the form of an erythematous, oedematous plaque that is circumscribed and painful both spontaneously and on palpation.

Homolateral inflammatory adenopathies are frequently associated. There may be limited bullous or purpuric lesions which have no adverse significance.

In 1/3 of cases, an entry point can be identified: intertrigo or inter-digitoplantar fissure, preferably in the 3rd and 4th inter-tortal spaces, puncture, traumatic erosion or ulcer.

In most cases, the disease progresses favourably in 8 to 10 days under antibiotic treatment.

Apyrexia within 48 to 72 hours is a sign that the treatment is effective. Local signs improve more slowly, in 1 week, sometimes with post-inflammatory desquamation in cases of venous or lymphatic insufficiency.

In diabetic patients suffering from trophic disorders, the infection may be subacute, with little fever and little or no pain in the case of associated neuropathy; local inflammatory signs may be less marked and the therapeutic response slower.

If the disease does not progress favourably under treatment, it may be due to an unusual germ resistant to the antibiotic prescribed, poor compliance, immunosuppression, progression to necrosis or abscessation, or another diagnosis. These very rare situations require a second- or third-line opinion, or even hospitalisation.
