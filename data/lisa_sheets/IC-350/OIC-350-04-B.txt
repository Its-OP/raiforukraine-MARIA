'''Prevalence and context guide the primary care physician (general practitioner or emergency doctor) in his reasoning.'''

'''Stasis dermodermatitis (due to venous insufficiency) is a frequent differential diagnosis. It has a less abrupt onset, is often bilateral, without fever, and resolves spontaneously with rest and elevation of the lower limbs.'''

'''Necrotising dermo-hypodermatitis is rare, but serious, and the primary care physician keeps it in mind. Pain and sepsis are both intense and precede the necrotic plaques.'''

'''Many other bacteria can be responsible for erythematous plaques, and the context of the questioning guides the primary care physician. For example, a rabbit farmer may be diagnosed with tularemia, a hunter or walker with Lyme borreliosis, etc.''

'''Many other situations can be evoked depending on the context, from the simplest such as "sunburn" or insect bites, to the most complicated with autoimmune diseases requiring third-line advice such as''' TRAPS (tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 associated periodic syndrome).


The special case of venous thrombosis. Differentiating between erysipelas and venous thrombosis is often a problem for primary care physicians, mainly because of the potential severity of the thrombosis. Biological and paraclinical tests can help the doctor if the clinic and scores are not enough.
