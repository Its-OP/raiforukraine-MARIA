Clinical diagnosis: no further investigations are necessary in typical, uncomplicated cases.

In the case of atypical forms: limited benefit due to lack of sensitivity and specificity.

- Biology: CBC and C-reactive protein (CRP) show a biological inflammatory syndrome with hyperleukocytosis of PNN and CRP often > 100 mg/L). Their decrease under treatment is a sign of favourable evolution.

In severe cases :

- Blood cultures: low yield (positive in less than 5% of cases), because inflammatory symptoms are linked to a super antigen.  In cases of immunosuppression, specific exposure factors or extensive inflammatory plaques (particularly on the thigh), they are logical and may reveal an atypical germ;

- Bacteriological sampling of any portal of entry: enables antibiotic therapy to be adapted if necessary;

- Imaging: ultrasound of the soft tissue or MRI to be carried out immediately if necrotising dermo-hypodermatitis is suspected.

If there is any doubt about deep vein thrombosis: venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs.
