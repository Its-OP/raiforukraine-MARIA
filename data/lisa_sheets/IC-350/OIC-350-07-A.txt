When faced with a complaint of acute reddening of the skin, the clinic is fundamental in making the diagnosis of erysipelas, ruling out a diagnosis of necrotising dermo-hypodermatitis and considering other possible diagnoses.

The interview will focus on :

1- History :

a.     Date and mode of onset (sudden, insidious) ;

b.      Prodromal symptoms, particularly infectious: chills, fever ;

c.      Progression, specifying the effect of any treatments;

d.     Location (uni- or bilateral) ;

e.      Functional signs (pain, pruritus) ;

2- Antecedents that may be contributing factors

a.     General: immunodepression, frailty, co-morbidities (obesity)

b.     Local: vascular, rheumatological and dermatological

c.      History of large red leg

d.     Medication: antibiotics / steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories / topical treatments, etc.

3- Significant exposure factors (trauma, wounds, stings, bites, swimming, etc.)


The physical examination will focus on :

1- Identifying the primary lesion

a.     Uni- or bilateral location ;

b.     Erythemato-oedematous plaque'' often tense and painful on palpation, poorly defined;

c.     Presence of other associated lesions: vesicles (eczema), bullae, necrosis, loss of substance, crepitation ;

d.     '''Mark the limits of the lesion'' with a felt-tip pen to monitor its development

2- Look for an entry point

'''Intertrigo interorteil''', scratching lesions, ulcers, traumatic wounds, bites or stings;

3- Look for signs of severity (= necrotising fasciitis)

a.     Local: hypoesthesia or intense spontaneous pain

b.     General: fever, chills, signs of severe sepsis, shock.

4- Look for signs of aetiological orientation :

a.     Chronic venous insufficiency lesions: oedema, varicose veins, lipodermatosclerosis ;

b.     Peripheral pedal and posterior tibial pulses (AOMI) ;

c.      Diabetic neuropathy, lymphangitis with adenopathy


'''Diagnosis of the situation:'''

Diagnosis of infectious dermo-hypodermatitis :

1- If the patient has a high-risk background: hospitalisation is required for monitoring and intravenous treatment.

2- If the patient presents general signs of poor tolerance, hospitalisation is necessary for intravenous treatment, or even intensive care.

3- If the patient presents signs of necrotising dermo-hypodermatitis, hospitalisation is required for intensive care, intravenous treatment and emergency surgery.

4- If there are no signs of seriousness, the patient is treated as an outpatient.
