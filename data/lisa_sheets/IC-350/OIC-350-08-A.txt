The initiation of treatment for bacterial dermo-hypodermatitis should not be delayed by waiting for additional tests, which are generally of little diagnostic value.

'''In the absence of signs of seriousness, management is ambulatory:'''

- '''Anti-streptococcal antibiotic therapy: AMOXICILLIN 3gr/d in 3 doses for 7 days;'''

- Bed rest with leg elevated until signs of inflammation subside;

- Painkillers (contraindication to NSAIDs) ;

- Tetanus vaccination to be checked and renewed if necessary;

- Anticoagulant treatment with calcium heparin or low molecular weight heparin in preventive doses "only" in the case of risk factors for thromboembolic disease;

- Reassessment of treatment after 72 h :

◦ continuation of outpatient treatment if favourable ;

◦ hospitalization if extension ;

◦ diagnostic review;

'''Hospitalisation is only necessary if parenteral treatment and/or close monitoring are required, in particular:'''

- If the patient has a high-risk background :

◦ immunosuppression;

◦ comorbidities likely to decompensate;

◦ social context: dependence, precariousness.

- If the patient presents general signs of poor tolerance :

◦ High, poorly tolerated fever;

◦ Hypotension, tachycardia, marbling ;

◦ Tachypnea;

◦ oliguria;

◦ confusion ;

- In the absence of improvement or extension after 72 hours of well-managed treatment
