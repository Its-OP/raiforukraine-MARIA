'''Stye=''''' furuncle of the free edge of the eyelid centred on a pilosebaceous follicle of the eyelash.

It corresponds to a bacterial infection, most often with Staphylococcus aureus, of the pilosebaceous follicle. It develops over a few days and can cause severe pain. Clinically, it appears as a red swelling centred by a white dot at the free edge. Secretions are not always present at first.
