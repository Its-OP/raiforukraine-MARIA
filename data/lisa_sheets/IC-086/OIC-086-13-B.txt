The lacrimal ducts are physiologically non-permeable at birth, and become perforated in the first few days of life with the first tears.

It is not uncommon for watery eyes to persist for several weeks, either unilaterally or bilaterally.

If there is swelling in the internal angle, signs of inflammation or purulent discharge, an ophthalmologist should be consulted to look for dacryocystitis (infection of the lacrimal sac).

When lacrimation is isolated, treatment consists of saline lavage with antiseptics during lacrimation episodes.

If the watering persists, a catheter can be inserted without anaesthetic from the age of 4 months.
