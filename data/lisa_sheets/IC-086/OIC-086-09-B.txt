'''Most frequent benign palpebral tumours:'''

*papilloma
*hidrocystoma (lacrimal cyst)
*xanthelesmas (cholesterol deposits)

'''Most frequent malignant palpebral tumours:'''

*<u>Epithelial tumours:</u>
**basal cell carcinoma, which presents a risk of ulceration and local decay
**and more rarely the more aggressive "squamous cell carcinoma" with metastatic potential.

*<Malignant non-epithelial tumours
**malignant melanoma
**MALT lymphoma


'''The signs of malignancy of a palpebral tumour are as follows:'''

* rapid and continuous growth ;
* heterochromia
* tissue invasion ;
* loss of eyelashes (Madarosis);
* for basal cell carcinoma: pearly nodules and telangiectasias.


Management of malignant tumours of the eyelids: this requires the opinion of a multidisciplinary consultation meeting, and can range from removal with simple surveillance (nodular basal cell carcinoma removed in its entirety) to combined radio-chemotherapy depending on the histology and the margins of removal.
