Hashimoto's thyroiditis:

- is an autoimmune disease (anti-TPO (thyroperoxidase) antibodies) leading to lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid parenchyma.

- with no biological repercussions in the initial phase (normal thyroid work-up), hypothyroidism progressively sets in with the destruction of thyreocytes

- may be associated with other autoimmune disorders, endocrinological or other, personal or familial.
