Peripheral hypothyroidism is the most common, particularly in women (1 in 13 women and 1 in 30 men), and increases with age.

Some pathologies predispose to peripheral hypothyroidism: autoimmune endocrinopathies, Turner syndrome and trisomy 21.

In less than 1% of cases, hypothyroidism is linked to thyroid insufficiency.
