In very elderly patients or those with coronary artery disease, there is a risk of coronary artery disease being detected, especially if the hypothyroidism is deep-rooted and long-standing:

- Warn elderly patients or patients with controlled coronary artery disease that they should seek medical advice in the event of chest pain

- The initial dosage of levothyroxine is 12.5 µg per day to 25 µg per day;

- Dosage gradually increased in steps of 12.5 to 25 µg every 1 to 2 weeks until the theoretically effective dose is reached;

- Initiation of inpatient treatment with daily clinical and electrographic monitoring

[Electrocardiogram: indications and interpretation
