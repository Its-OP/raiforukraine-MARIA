[Thyroid workup analysis SD-194

'''1)''' <u>The diagnosis of peripheral hypothyroidism (involvement of the thyroid gland) is made on an increase in '''TSH'''</u>.

In a second step, if TSH is high, free T4 is measured

*Normal free T4: mild or subclinical hypothyroidism (low TSH, between 4 and 10 mIU/l)
*low free T4: hypothyroidism (TSH > 10 mIU/l)

<u>2) The diagnosis of thyroid insufficiency is based on the measurement of '''T4L,''' and TSH.</u>

T4L is always low. TSH is normal or low, unsuitable for the low T4 value.

*Pituitary adenoma
