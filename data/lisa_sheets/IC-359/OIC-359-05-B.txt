ARDS: lesional oedema (not cardiogenic)

Main risk factors for ARDS in adults and children :

- Pneumonia

- Non-pulmonary sepsis

- Inhalation

- Non-cardiogenic shock

- Acute pancreatitis

- Polytrauma

- More rarely: pulmonary contusion, severe burns, pulmonary lesions associated with multiple transfusions (TRALI), pulmonary vasculitis, drowning, overdose.

Hyaline membrane disease is a pathology specific to premature newborns, which combines respiratory distress with a bilateral infiltrate on the chest X-ray. It is linked to a surfactant deficiency secondary to prematurity.
