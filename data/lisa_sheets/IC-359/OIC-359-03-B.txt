1°) Alveolar hypoventilation :

o Failure of central respiratory control

o Abnormality of the "ventilatory pump" (e.g. muscles unable to maintain alveolar ventilation)

o Increase in dead space (= ventilated areas that are not or are poorly perfused)

>>> Correction of PaO<sub>2</sub> by oxygen therapy

2°) Shunt (most frequent mechanism) = areas perfused but with little or no ventilation

o Obstruction or dysfunction of the alveolus

o Alteration of the alveolocapillary membrane

o Cardiac communications

>>> If "true shunt" (perfusion but total absence of ventilation, e.g. intracardiac shunt): no correction of PaO<sub>2</sub> by oxygen therapy.

>>> If "shunt effect" (excess perfusion in relation to a relative perfusion defect): correction of PaO<sub>2</sub> by oxygen therapy.

3°) "Low PvO<sub>2</sub>" effect: in the event of shock, the increase in tissue extraction of O<sub>2</sub> lowers venous O2 saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>), leading to contamination of arterial blood by venous blood with low O2 in the event of a pre-existing shunt.

>>> Improvement in PaO<sub>2</sub> with correction of shock
