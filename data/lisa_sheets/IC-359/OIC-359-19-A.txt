- High concentration mask at 15 L/min then adapt the O<sub>2</sub> flow rate for SpO2 > 94% (89-92% in COPD patients, even if it means switching back to a conventional mask without reservoir).

The high-concentration mask must have the two lateral fins so that the FiO2 is as high as possible (in theory 100%).
