Impairment of pump function is :

-Primary: impairment of central respiratory control (e.g. brainstem stroke) or respiratory neuromuscular impairment (spinal cord injury, myopathy, myasthenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

-Secondary: fatigue of the respiratory muscles due to an increase in the work of breathing caused by the acute respiratory distress.

It is responsible for alveolar hypoventilation with hypoxia/hypercapnia.
