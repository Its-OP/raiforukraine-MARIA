Inhalation of foreign body :

- Notion of penetration syndrome

- Sounds suggestive of airway obstruction

o Inspiratory = Stridor, horn = glottic or supraglottic obstruction

o 2-stage = tracheal obstruction

o Expiratory = wheezing = subtracheal obstacle

- +/- hypersialorrhoea depending on the location of the foreign body


Acute epiglottitis :

- Signs of respiratory distress

- Marked deterioration in general condition

- Fever

- Hypersialorrhoea
