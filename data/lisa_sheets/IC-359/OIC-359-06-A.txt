1°) Signs of clinical severity

o Cyanosis, decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub>.

o Acute respiratory distress

o Signs of circulatory insufficiency (e.g. arterial hypotension, mottling)

o Neurological signs (agitation, anxiety, confusion, convulsions, coma)

2°) Signs of gas severity

o Degree of hypoxemia (hypoxemia = PaO<sub>2</sub> < 80 mm Hg in AA): degree of decrease in PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO2 ratio (hypoxemia if < 300)

o Degree of hypercapnia (hypercapnia = PaCO<sub>2</sub> > 42 mm Hg): take care if this indicates respiratory exhaustion.

o Hyperlactatemia > 2 mmol/L
