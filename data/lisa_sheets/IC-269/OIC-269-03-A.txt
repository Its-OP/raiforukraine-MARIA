The diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in children requires a full clinical examination and repeated reassessment.

Additional tests will not be carried out systematically, but only if there is any doubt about the diagnosis following the clinical examination.

When imaging is required, the first-line examination in children is an ultrasound scan, not a CT scan.
