In infants, abdominal pain should be suspected in the presence of crying, screaming or restlessness. These signs are not specific and abdominal pain must be confirmed by a complete physical examination on an undressed child.

Larger children localise the pain in the abdomen, but the topography is often not very precise when the child is young.
