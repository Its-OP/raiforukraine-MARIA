The diagnosis is made in the presence of episodes of paroxysmal abdominal pain in a child aged between 2 months and 2 years. Normal behaviour between seizures. Pallor or hypotonia at the time of the seizure. The child refuses to eat (which causes the pain). Redcurrant jelly rectal discharge (mucus and blood) is common. Rarely, the intussusception pudding is palpated subhepatically.

Any suspicion of acute intestinal intussusception should prompt an abdominal ultrasound scan, which is the gold standard for diagnosing this condition.

Enema under radiographic or ultrasound control is indicated for therapeutic purposes in primary ileocolic forms of intestinal intussusception.
