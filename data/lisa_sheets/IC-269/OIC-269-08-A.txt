▪ ''''' Abdominal ultrasound''''' is the first-line examination for gynaecological and urinary pathologies, bilio-pancreatic pathologies and the search for intra-abdominal infectious foci. It is effective for pathologies involving solid organs, but useless in cases of digestive haemorrhage (it cannot localise bleeding or its cause), or in cases of obstruction (the examination is hampered by gas in the digestive tract).

▪ '''''The injected abdomino-pelvic scanner''''' is the reference examination in cases of suspected surgical emergency (occlusion, perforation, peritonitis, mesenteric infarction, etc.) but also certain medical causes (acute diverticulitis, abdominal infectious focus or mass). It may be indicated as a 2nd<sup>nd</sup> line after ultrasound in other pathologies or in cases of diagnostic doubt (for example: a very poor abdominal examination contrasting with very intense pain). It is more than 90% sensitive, and aids the surgical decision by changing the planned attitude in a third of cases, particularly if there are signs of severity.

▪ '''''Oesogastroduodenal endoscopy''''' will be indicated in cases of acute epigastric pain that may raise the suspicion of an ulcer, as neither ultrasound nor CT scans are effective in exploring gastroduodenal pain.

▪ A chest X-ray may be taken if there are respiratory signs.
