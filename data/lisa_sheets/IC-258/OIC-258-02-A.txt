|The MDRD and CKD-EPI formulae directly estimate GFR indexed to body surface area (result in ml/min/1.73 m2); they include sex, age, creatinine level and ethnicity, but not weight [[178|(178)]).

These formulas can be flawed and cannot be used in cases of severe undernutrition or amyotrophy, cirrhosis, pregnancy or non-standard body size. In these situations, renal function can be assessed by measuring GFR by calculating the clearance of exogenous substances filtered by the kidney (labelled DTPA, Iohexol).

The French National Authority for Health (2012) recommends using the CKD-EPI formula based on creatinine levels determined by enzymatic methods.

Significance of GFR in chronic renal failure :

- GFR is normal at between 90 and 120 ml/min/1.73 m2 ;

- Between 60 and 89 ml/min/1.73 m2 , chronic renal failure is mild. In the absence of markers of renal impairment persisting for more than 3 months (proteinuria and/or haematuria, leucocyturia, morphological abnormalities of the urinary tract), it is considered to be non-pathological (absence of chronic renal disease);

- A GFR of less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 is sufficient to define chronic kidney disease (see chapter 15), whether or not markers of kidney damage are present.
