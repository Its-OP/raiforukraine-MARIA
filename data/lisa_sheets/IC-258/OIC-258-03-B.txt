|The Cockcroft and Gault formula is an estimate of creatinine clearance, which is itself an estimate of GFR. It includes age, sex, weight and creatinine level.  The result obtained is in ml/min (not indexed to body surface area).

Ccr = [(140 - age (years)) × weight (kg)] × k Creatininaemia (µmol/L)

k = 1.23 for men - k = 1.04 for women


In children (< 18 years) GFR is estimated using the Schwartz formula


GFR ml/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> = height (cm) x 36.5 / creatinine (µmol/l)



Normal creatinine values are lower in children than in adults (up to the age of 5, creatinine levels are generally < 35 µmol/L).
