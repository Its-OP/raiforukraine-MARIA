Complementary tests should be carried out as a first line of defence:

Blood: protein electrophoresis, fasting blood sugar, ionogram (Na, K, Cl, bicarbonates)

Urinary: 24-hour proteinuria or proteinuria/creatininuria ratio on urine sample, urine cytology to detect haematuria or leucocyturia.

Imaging: renal ultrasound (measure the size of the kidneys and look for asymmetry, bumpy contours, polycystic kidneys, nephrocalcinosis, urinary stones, hydronephrosis)

Ultrasound examination of the bladder: looking for pathology of the lower apparatus and post-void residue

Nephrological advice is recommended for the indication of a renal biopsy, additional functional (tubulopathy, lithiasis) or morphological investigations, genetic investigations, etc.
