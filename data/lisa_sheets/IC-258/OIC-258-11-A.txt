The most common parenchymal cause of acute elevation of creatinine is tubular necrosis:

The clinical context is suggestive: shock, toxic causes, rhabdomyolysis, intratubular obstruction, etc.

AKI is naked: absence of [[102|proteinuria]] or [[212|haematuria]], absence of [[urine dipstick]] abnormality of [[196|urinary sediment]], absence of hypertension.
The less frequent causes of ARF are glomerular, interstitial and vascular:

|-
|Glomerular nephropathy
|- HTA

- Oedema

- History of proteinuria or haematuria
|- Glomerular proteinuria (>50% albumin) of variable rate (sometimes nephrotic)

- Haematuria and/or red blood cells depending on the cause

- Symmetrical kidneys, regular contours

- Harmonic atrophy at an advanced stage

|Tubulointerstitial nephropathy
|- Absent or moderate late-onset hypertension

- History of recurrent urinary tract infections, uropathy, gout, metabolic disease.
|- Low-flow proteinuria

(< 1 g/d and/or < 50% albumin)

- Germ-free leucocyturia

- Leukocyte cylinders

- Asymmetric renal atrophy, bumpy contours
