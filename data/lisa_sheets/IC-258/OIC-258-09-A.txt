Functional renal failure corresponds to a state of true or effective hypovolaemia (frequent situation ++ )

Clinical context :

true hypovolaemia

- arterial hypotension: extracellular dehydration (weight loss, skin folds) or overall dehydration, haemorrhage,

- before the hypotension stage: look for orthostatic hypotension (++);

effective hypovolaemia (situations where renal perfusion pressure is low without true hypovolaemia):

- major oedematous states during hypoprotidemia (nephrotic syndrome, hepatocellular insufficiency, malnutrition), cirrhosis with oedemato-ascitic decompensation, total or right heart failure,

- septic, anaphylactic or cardiogenic shock in the initial phase,

drugs that interfere with the regulation of renal haemodynamics: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists, etc.
