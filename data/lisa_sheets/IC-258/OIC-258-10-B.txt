In favour of the functional origin of renal failure:

- ratio (1000 × plasma urea mmol/L/creatinine µmol/L) > 100 ;

- signs of concentrated urine :

U/P osmolar > 2,

U/P urea > 10,

U/P creatinine > 30.

- Urinary Na < 20 mmol/L, Na excretion fraction < 1% (except in the case of renal sodium losses, for example when diuretic treatment is instituted);

- low excreted urea fraction (< 35%) indicating increased tubular reabsorption;

reversal of the urinary Na/K ratio (secondary hyperaldosteronism).
