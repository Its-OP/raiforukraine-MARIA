There are 3 criteria for chronic renal failure:

'''1. '''anamnestic criteria :

a history of kidney disease,

evidence of increased creatinine levels several months or years previously,

no clinical context leading to acute renal failure (shock, resuscitation, effective hypovolaemia, medication, etc.);

'''2.    '''morphological criteria (ultrasound) :

reduction in kidney size: < 10 cm on ultrasound ;

Exceptions: Diabetes (++), Bilateral hydronephrosis, Autosomal dominant polycystic fibrosis, Amyloidosis, HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN).

'''3.    '''biological criteria: two abnormalities point to CKD:

- Aregenerative normocytic normochromic anaemia (lack of EPO production),

Exceptions: haemolytic uraemic syndrome, haemorrhagic shock

- hypocalcaemia due to deficiency of active vitamin D (calcitriol, lack of hydroxylation to 1 Î±).

Exceptions: CKD without hypocalcaemia: myeloma, sarcoidosis or granulomatosis

Exceptions: ARF with hypocalcaemia: rhabdomyolysis, tumour lysis syndrome
