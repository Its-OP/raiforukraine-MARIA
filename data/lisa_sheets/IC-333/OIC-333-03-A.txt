Protecting carers is essential to enable the damage caused by the crisis to be repaired. Ensuring the safetý of the doctor consists of '''removing himself from danger by confining himself in or escaping to a safe area'', if necessary by taking patients there. Priority must be given to controlling the threat (extinguishing a fire, extracting oneself from a flooded area, neutralising the terrorist threat, ...)
