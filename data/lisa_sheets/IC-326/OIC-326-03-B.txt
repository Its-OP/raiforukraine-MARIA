The '''medical service rendered''' [SMR] and the <nowiki/>''improved medical service'''l [ASMR] make it possible to answer the following two questions:

*Does the drug have sufficient ''clinical interest'' to be ''covered by national health insurance''?
*Does the drug offer ''progress compared with available treatments''?

The SMR and ASMR are assessed by the '''Commission de la Transparence''' [CT] of the '''Haute Autorité de santé''' [HAS] <u>after</u> the drug has obtained its marketing authorisation [AMM].

==Medical service rendered [SMR]==
The '''SMR''' provides scientific and clinical evidence to the Union nationale des caisses d'assurance maladie [UNCAM] and the Minister to '''justify whether or not drugs should be reimbursed'' by '''national solidarity''.

The ''SMR'' is determined on the basis of characteristics relating to the ''indication'' and the ''medicinal product'':

*the ''efficacy'' and ''adverse effects'' of the medicinal product;
*the preventive, curative or symptomatic nature of the medicinal product;
*its ''place in the therapeutic strategy'', in relation to other available therapies;
*its ''public health value'': severity of the disease, prevalence, medical need and response, impact on quality of life, impact in terms of morbidity and mortality, and impact on the organisation of care.

Based on the assessment of these criteria, four ''SMR'' levels have been defined, which ''determine'' access to reimbursement and the ''rate'' of reimbursement:
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Clinical interest - SMR
!Reimbursement rate
|-
|Important
|65 %
|-
|Moderate
|30 %
|-
|Low
|15 %
|-
|Inadequate
|Not reimbursed
|}

==Medical service improvement [ASMR]==
The ASMR corresponds to the ''therapeutic progress'' made by a drug in a given disease. It therefore depends on the other reference treatments available.

Based on this assessment, five levels of ASMR have been defined to help determine the price of the drug:
{| class="wikitable"
