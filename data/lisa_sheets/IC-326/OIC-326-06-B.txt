According to the Code of Medical Deontology - '''article R4127-11 du CSP''' - : ''every doctor maintains and perfects his knowledge in compliance with his obligation of continuous professional development''. <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000025843562</ref> This '''<u>obligation</u>''' of continuing professional development [DPC] concerns '''all doctors registered''' with the Ordre des m√©decins.

The objectives of this CPD are set out in Article L4021-1 of the CSP: "Continuing professional development aims to maintain and update knowledge and skills and to improve practices. It constitutes an obligation for healthcare professionals'''. <ref>https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/section_lc/LEGITEXT000006072665/LEGISCTA000020888297/#LEGISCTA000020897548</ref>
