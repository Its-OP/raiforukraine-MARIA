Prescribing a drug must take into account the patient's individual situation, and requires knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug to be prescribed, as well as a comparison of these elements with those of the patient's physiology, in particular age, weight and the functional capacity of the main purifying organs. This individual assessment should be carried out systematically before any initial prescription or prescription renewal, in order to assess the "benefit/risk ratio" of the prescription in question, and should be continued on an ongoing basis throughout the prescription period.

==Pre-therapeutic assessment
Before any prescription is given, the patient must be assessed on the basis of :

*Their "demographic characteristics": age (extreme ages sometimes require treatment to be adapted), weight (extreme weights can have an impact on drug pharmacokinetics), ethnic origin (certain genetic polymorphisms are more frequent depending on the patient's origin, leading to treatment restrictions or adaptations).
*Medical history: any allergies and intercurrent pathologies (which may contraindicate certain drugs).
*Assessment of the patient's "major drug purification functions": assessment of renal function (estimate of glomerular filtration rate) and liver function (presence of hepatocellular insufficiency and severity of any impairment).
*Drug treatments'' already prescribed to the patient and/or self-medicated (which may need to be adapted depending on the risk of drug interaction).

==Therapeutic objective ==
The prescriber must also establish a ''therapeutic objective'' in a ''concerted manner with the patient'', based on objective factors that enable the achievement of this objective to be assessed. These are :

in the case of ''curative'' treatment, elements of improvement in the patient's condition which are measurable or perceived by the patient, or * in the case of ''preventive'' treatment, are based on public health data indicating a reduction in the risk of an event,
* in the case of ''preventive'' treatment, are based on public health data indicating a reduction in the risk of an event.

==Definition of the individual benefit/risk ratio ==
The prescriber must also assess the benefit and risk of the drug prescription according to scientific data, mainly phase III and IV therapeutic trials.

This report is ''evolving'' for a ''medicinal product'' in a ''given indication'' and must be ''frequently re-evaluated'' on the basis of new scientific information obtained.

This ''benefit/risk'' ratio must be put into perspective in terms of the patient's ''individual situation'' (specific benefits and risks in the population sub-group to which the patient belongs).

==Choice of treatment ==
Taken together, these factors should make it possible to ''determine the appropriate drug(s)'' as part of a treatment tailored to the individual patient. The selection criteria are based on :

*L'''' authorisation de mise sur le march√©'' (AMM) of the medicinal product in a ''precise indication''. Prescription outside the scope of the MA can only be exceptional and carried out under strict conditions defined in article L. 5121-12-1 of the French Public Health Code.
*The "level of evidence" of the drug's efficacy in the indication in question. The choice between two medicinal products for the same indication should always be guided by the ''highest level of evidence'', and where the level of evidence is equal, preference should be given to the medicinal product with the greatest experience of use.
*The patient's ''pre-therapeutic assessment'', the ''therapeutic objective'' defined and the individual benefit-risk ratio previously established for this patient.

==Treatment evaluation
Once the prescription has been made, provision must be made for monitoring the treatment, and the prescriber must evaluate the treatment on an ongoing basis. This evaluation covers :

*The ''efficacy of the treatment'', which must be consistent with the therapeutic objective defined above.
*Assessment of the drug's ''safety profile'', which will focus on the main adverse reaction signals detected during therapeutic trials and pharmacovigilance monitoring.
*Drug monitoring, based on clinical data (e.g. blood pressure measurement for antihypertensive drugs), biological data (e.g. blood sugar monitoring for diabetes treatment) and pharmacovigilance data, pharmacological therapeutic monitoring OIC-321-02-A|pharmacological therapeutic monitoring]]'' (measurement of blood concentrations of immunosuppressants in the context of the prevention of rejection in organ transplantation, for example).

These elements of treatment evaluation enable the "benefit-risk ratio" to be reassessed throughout the prescription period, and may require the drug to be adapted or discontinued depending on changes in the ratio.
