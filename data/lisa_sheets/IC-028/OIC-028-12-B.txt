'''[[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test SD-178|Urinary tract ultrasound]]''' is recommended. It should be carried out within 24 hours if there are any signs of severity or a ''hyperalgesic picture'' to rule out a renal abscess or an obstruction in the urinary excretory tract.

In exceptional cases, a CT scan may be considered in the event of a complication.
