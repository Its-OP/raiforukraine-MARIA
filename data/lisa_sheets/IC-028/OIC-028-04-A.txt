The principles are as follows:

- '''No probabilistic treatment in the absence of symptoms'' (otherwise cf. acute cystitis)

- '''Adapted to the results of the ECBU''' '''and the antibiogram''' (which must be waited for!)

- Choice in order according to Table 1 - 255. [Prescribing an anti-infective SD-255|Prescribing an anti-infective

- The risk of gestational ANP alone justifies the treatment of urinary colonisation in all pregnant women.


Monitoring includes:

- '''[[Analysis of a control urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU 8 to 10 days]]''' after the end of treatment;

- '''[[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU monthly]]''' until delivery;

- In the event of group B streptococcus (GBS) in the urine: per-partum prevention identical to that for patients with vaginal GBS;

- Hygienic and dietary rules: plenty to drink (2 litres per day), frequent urination and urination after sexual intercourse, good perineal hygiene (wiping from front to back after urination).


If left untreated, two risks are feared: progression to cystitis or even acute pyelonephritis, and the threat of premature delivery.
