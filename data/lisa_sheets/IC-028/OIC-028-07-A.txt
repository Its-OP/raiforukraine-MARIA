The biological diagnosis is based on '''the performance of a [[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU]]'''[[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|.]]

An ECBU should be carried out regardless of the result of the urine dipstick in the presence of clinical signs of acute cystitis.  

The microbiological criteria for acute cystitis are :

- '''Leukocyturia threshold > 10<sup>4</sup>/mL'''

- '''And bacteriuria threshold:''''

- '''≥ 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL for most bacteria except ''E. coli'''''

- '''≥ 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for E. coli (and Staphylococcus saprophyticus)'''
