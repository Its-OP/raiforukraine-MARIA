Urinary tract colonisation in pregnancy complicates 2 to 10% of pregnancies. It may progress to acute cystitis and/or acute pyelonephritis.

It is defined by '''asymptomatic bacteriuria''' on '''urine cytobacteriological examination (UCE)''' with a threshold of '''bacteriuria ≥ 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL''' (whatever the bacteria - ''[[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (UCE)]]'''''

Unlike acute cystitis, there is "no influence of leucocyte count" in the diagnosis of urinary colonisation.

Only one positive ECBU is accepted for the diagnosis of colonisation.

It is screened monthly in all pregnant women by performing the '''[[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|urine dipstick (UD)]]'''' - The SD-182 urine dipstick is tested for leukocytes and/or nitrites. If positive, a ''cyto-bacteriological examination of the urine'' should be carried out.
