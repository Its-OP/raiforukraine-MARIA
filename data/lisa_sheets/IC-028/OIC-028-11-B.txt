Management is based on the following principles, with no criteria for severity:

- Initial hospitalisation;

- '''Probabilistic treatment''' to be started urgently, as soon as the BU or ECBU (culture) is obtained, with antibiotic therapy according to Table 3. 255. [Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|Prescribe an anti-infective]]

- Secondarily adapted to the results of the antibiogram (48 hours on average, see below).

'''In the presence of signs of severity''' (severe sepsis, obstructive renal failure), management is based on:

- '''Systematic hospitalization'''

- Emergency ''probabilistic treatment'' as soon as the BU or ECBU (culture) is obtained, using ''dual antibiotic therapy'' according to Table 4 (addition of an ''aminoglycoside for a maximum of 48 hours for the foetal kidney and ear'').

- Secondarily adapted to antibiotic susceptibility testing (48 hours on average, see below)

- Emergency surgical drainage if obstruction (under antibiotic therapy)

'''Other measures''' '''associated''' during hospitalization :

- '''Obstetrical surveillance''' +/- tocolytic treatment if there is a threat of premature delivery

*Paracetamol 1g every 6 hours for analgesic and antipyretic purposes,
*Hygienic and dietetic rules (see Gravidial urinary colonisation).

'''The recommended relay treatment''' after receipt of the antibiogram is :

- Oral antibiotic therapy with :

o 1<sup>rst</sup> intention if susceptible strain (best tolerated) : Amoxicillin

o 2<sup>th</sup> intention (equivalents) : Amoxicillin-Ac clavulanic or Cefixime or Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim (avoid for the first 2 months)

- Total duration of 10 to 14 days

- ''[[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment then monthly]]''' until delivery
