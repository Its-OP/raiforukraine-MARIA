[[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|The]] biological diagnosis is based on '''performing a [[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU]] as an emergency.''''

The ECBU must be carried out regardless of the result of the urine dipstick.  

The microbiological criteria are the same as those for acute cystitis, i.e. :

- '''Leukocyturia threshold > 10<sup>4</sup>/mL'''

- '''And bacteriuria threshold:''''

- '''≥ 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL for most bacteria except ''E. coli'''''

- '''≥ 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for E. coli (and Staphylococcus saprophyticus)'''

The assessment must also ''look for signs of seriousness'' (severe sepsis, renal failure due to obstructive pyelonephritis) and include :

- [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|'''NFS, CRP,''']] [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186]] [[Blood count interpretation SD-223]] '''+/- creatininaemia and blood cultures (optional depending on the context)'''
