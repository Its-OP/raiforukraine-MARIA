Infection of the renal parenchyma and excretory tract, as evidenced by the presence of germs in the urine, is the most common infection during pregnancy (10% of pregnant women).

The contributing factors found were :

== mechanical factors: ==
- compression of the bladder by the pregnant uterus

- compression and stretching of the ureters due to uterine dextroposition

== Hormonal factors: ==
- progesterone inhibits peristalsis of the urinary tract and reduces ureterovesical sphincter tone, which encourages reflux and stagnation of urine,

- oestrogens are responsible for hyperhaemia of the trigone, encouraging germs to adhere to the urothelium;

== Chemical factors: ==
- alkalinisation of urine,

- physiological glycosuria

- vulvoperineal microbial proliferation and shortness of the female urethra ;
