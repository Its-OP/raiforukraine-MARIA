Chest X-rays are indicated in emergency situations that are not life-threatening in the short term: acute dyspnoea, chest pain, haemoptysis, acute cough, inhalation of foreign bodies, abnormal respiratory sounds, acute stridor. If the prognosis is life-threatening, a chest CT scan with injection is generally indicated as the first line of defence.

The main "non-indications" for emergency chest radiography are :

* Suspicion of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism or oesophageal rupture, thoracic trauma or polytrauma: CT scan with injection as first-line treatment.
* Suspected myocardial infarction: ECG, coronary angiography.
* Upper airway infection, unequivocal and uncomplicated bronchiolitis in children: no imaging.

Chest CT scans in low-dose or ultra-low-dose mode are now being used more and more frequently in emergency departments, as a complement to or replacement for chest X-rays. Profile radiography is used less and less.
