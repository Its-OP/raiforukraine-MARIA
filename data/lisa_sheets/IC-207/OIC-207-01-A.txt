Lung opacity is a term generally reserved for chest radiography. It is characterised by a loss of normal radiolucency in the lung, which can take on very different forms depending on its size, morphology, contours, location, and whether it is more or less opaque, systematised, retractile, etc. A radiographic pulmonary opacity will correspond in CT to more precise semiological descriptors: nodule, mass, condensation, ground glass, etc.

The aetiological range of pulmonary opacities is very broad. It covers diseases of the lung parenchyma, but also beyond, since pleural, parietal or mediastinal abnormalities may be projected radiographically into the lung areas (Figure 1). Radiographic opacities can thus be categorised into syndromes: alveolar syndrome, interstitial syndrome, nodular syndrome, cavitary syndrome, bronchial syndrome, mediastinal syndrome, pleural syndrome and parietal syndrome.<gallery widths="1000" heights="500">

However, this presentation is neither sensitive nor specific. In fact, the majority of pulmonary nodules (3mm-3cm) seen on CT are benign, and conversely, lung cancer may present as a mediastinal or hilar mass (Figure 2). Only histological examination can confirm malignancy.<gallery widths="800" heights="600">
