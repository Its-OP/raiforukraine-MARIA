The mediastinum is the anatomical region of the thorax between the two lungs. It is arbitrarily divided into three compartments, which are often defined as such on a profile X-ray (Figure 1):

*The ''anterior mediastinum'', which contains fatty tissue, the thymus and ganglion chains.
*The middle mediastinum, which contains the heart, ascending thoracic aorta and crossover, pulmonary artery, trachea and main bronchi, phrenic and vagus nerves, and lymph node chains.
*The '''posterior mediastinum''', which contains the descending thoracic aorta, oesophagus, splanchnic and sympathetic nerves, paravertebral fat, lymph node chains

Mediastinal abnormalities may correspond to :

*The presence of a tumoral, inflammatory, infectious or congenital mass in the mediastinum. Example: mediastinal lymphoma, neurogenic tumour, paraspinal abscess, bronchogenic cyst, etc.
*''An abnormal increase in volume of a mediastinal structure.'' Example: aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, dilatation of the pulmonary artery, cardiomegaly.
*''An abnormal presence of an extra-mediastinal structure'' in the mediastinum. Example: intra-thoracic thyroid goitre, hiatal hernia.


The main causes of mediastinal masses, classified by compartment, are summarised in the following table:

On a chest X-ray, a mediastinal abnormality ''is characterised by an opacity''.

*A clear external boundary convex towards the lung
*Gently sloping into the mediastinum
*Internal limit not visible because indistinguishable from mediastinal elements
*Hydric in tone like the rest of the mediastinum

The ''mediastinal contours'' (Figure 2) are therefore often distorted. On the right, the superior arch corresponds to the right brachiocephalic venous trunk, the middle arch to the superior vena cava, the inferior arch to the right atrium and minimally to the inferior vena cava. On the left, the superior arch corresponds to the left subclavian artery, the middle arch to the aortic button and pulmonary artery, and the inferior arch to the left ventricle.<gallery widths="600" heights="550">

The left pulmonary hilum is always slightly higher than the right. Normal pulmonary hili are never convex.

A frequently encountered mediastinal anomaly is cardiomegaly. Cardiomegaly is defined on a chest X-ray taken in the standing position only, by a '''cardiothoracic index greater than 0.5'' (Figure 3).<gallery widths="500" heights="500">

While chest X-rays can detect mediastinal abnormalities, thoracic CT is the examination of choice for ''pinpointing the location of the abnormality and characterising the lesion''. Mediastinal MRI may also be indicated in certain special cases.
