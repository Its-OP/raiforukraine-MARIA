The diagnosis of pneumothorax is made on an inspiratory radiograph of the thorax in the upright position, and the mediastinal impact is clarified. Radiographic diagnosis is more difficult in a supine patient. Exhalation X-rays are not recommended as they may increase the size of the pneumothorax.

Pleural ultrasound is a non-invasive examination that can be performed in the patient's bed (lying or sitting). In trained hands, it may be more sensitive than radiography for detecting small NOPs.

A chest CT scan is the most sensitive examination (a normal CT scan rules out the presence of a PNO) but is not essential for diagnosis. Its main indications are :

* Chest X-ray difficult to interpret
* Recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax looking for apical bubbles or underlying lung disease.
* Assessment for certain "at risk" professionals (divers, pilots)
* Traumatic pneumothorax: look for other associated traumatic abnormalities.

MRI and FDG PET-CT have no place in the assessment of ONP.


'''Semiology:'''

Standing chest x-ray

* Crescent-shaped avascular apico-lateral lung hyperclarity, delimited inferiorly and medially by a thin oblique line corresponding to the visceral pleura (Figure 1)
* Hydroaeric level if hydropneumothorax (Figure 2).

Signs of tension pneumothorax (Figure 3):

* Mediastinal shift towards the opposite side
* Lowering of the homolateral diaphragmatic dome
* Expansion of the homolateral hemithorax
* Enlargement of the intercostal spaces
* Total pulmonary retraction with collapsed pulmonary opacity at the hilum (complete collapse of the lung)

Scanner

* Air between the pleural layers
* Aetiological investigation: underlying lung lesions (emphysema, cystic lung disease, mesothelioma...) (Figure 4)
