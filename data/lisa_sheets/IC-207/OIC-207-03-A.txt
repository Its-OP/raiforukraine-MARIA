Front upright chest X-ray:

*Homogeneous, sloping, non-systematic, non-retractile opacity, limited by a concave line above and medially (Damoiseau's line) obliterating the diaphragmatic dome and the edge of the heart (Figure 1).
*The obliteration of a costodiaphragmatic cul-de-sac indicates a small effusion (Figure 2), which is best detected on a lateral view.
*A partitioned effusion is not always sloping and its internal border may be convex (Figure 3).
*Signs of pleurisy under tension (Figure 4): complete opacity of the hemithorax, mediastinal displacement towards the opposite side

Chest X-ray, supine, front view:

*More difficult to interpret because the pleural fluid moves posteriorly so that the interface between the lung and pleura is no longer tangential but becomes perpendicular to the X-rays (Figure 5).
*Asymmetry in lung transparency with opacity more marked on the side of the pleural effusion, with no clear boundary

Pleural ultrasound :

*Hypoechoic, sloping line separating the lung wall.
*Anechoic fluid may be an exudate or transudate.
*An echogenic or partitioned fluid is an exudate.
 
Chest scan

*Crescent-shaped image, concave towards the lung and therefore posterior (Figure 6).
*Haemothorax'': on a CT scan without injection, the density of the blood (around 60 HU) is greater than that of the pleural fluid (0-20 HU) (Figure 7).
*Empyema'': pleural effusion containing purulent fluid. The two layers of the pleura are thickened to form a biconvex pleural collection, the walls of which are enhanced after injection, sometimes with air bubbles or partitions within the collection (Figure 8).
*Hydropneumothorax'': mixed pleural effusion, liquid and air. It is seen on X-ray and CT scan by the presence of a hydro-aerosic level within the pleural cavity (Figure 9).
*Empyema can progress to "pachypleuritis" (or fibrothorax) in the form of pleural thickening, often calcified pleural layers, which can cause restrictive respiratory failure (Figure 10).
*'''A malignant tumour pleura''' will most often manifest as pleural thickening of more than one centimetre, with a frequently circumferential and/or nodular involvement (Figure 11)
