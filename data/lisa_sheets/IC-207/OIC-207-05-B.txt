'''Definition''': imaging of abnormal filling of the pulmonary alveoli with dense material (transudate, exudate, blood, pus, etc.). The most common cause is acute microbial pneumonia (bacterial or viral), more commonly known as acute frank lobar pneumonia. There are many other causes: intra-alveolar haemorrhage, fluid and sodium overload, organised pneumonia, pneumonic lung cancer, etc.

The definition of alveolar syndrome in imaging is classically based on two criteria:

*pulmonary opacity (denser or "whiter" than normal parenchyma)
*containing images of aerated bronchi (= aerated bronchogram)

The term "systemic" alveolar syndrome is used when a segment, lobe or lung is affected. In a lobar alveolar syndrome, the abnormalities stop at the pulmonary scissure delimiting the affected lobe (Figure 1). The silhouette sign can help to localise the opacity and its relationship with the mediastinum. The term "retractile" alveolar syndrome is used when there is a loss of volume in the lobe or lung concerned, which can be assessed by the displacement of the scissures, the pulmonary hilum or the diaphragmatic dome. A proximal bronchial obstruction should be sought. If the loss of volume is significant, we speak of ''''''athelectasis''.

CT imaging is more accurate than chest X-ray for diagnosing alveolar syndrome and investigating the cause. It can reveal ground-glass opacities that are difficult or impossible to see on X-ray, and look for complications such as pulmonary abscesses or pleural empyema. Only a typical chest X-ray in a patient with a strong suspicion of PFLA or acute pulmonary oedema may be sufficient for diagnosis; in all other cases, a CT scan will be necessary.<gallery widths="700" heights="500">

The presence of tubular aerial images within the opacity corresponds to bronchi that remain aerated (= aeric bronchogram, orange arrow).

Special presentations :

*Acute lobar frank pneumonia: non-retractable systematised alveolar syndrome in a patient with fever and cough (Figure 2).
*Some bacterial, fungal or viral pneumonias may present as multiple poorly limited alveolar opacities.
*Acute pulmonary oedema: bilateral, symmetrical, peri-hilar alveolar syndrome, often associated with bilateral pleural effusion.
*Alveolar bronchial cancer: more or less extensive alveolar opacities, sometimes nodular, containing an aerated bronchogram, in a patient at risk of bronchial cancer.
*Intra-alveolar haemorrhage: alveolar opacities, the topography of which indicates the site of bleeding (Figure 3).
*Organised pneumonia (cryptogenic or secondary): alveolar opacities are bilateral and migratory (Figure 4)<br />
