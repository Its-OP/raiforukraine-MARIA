Antibiotic therapy for sepsis should be started as soon as possible, after taking samples (at least blood cultures), but without waiting for the results.

It must be probabilistic, meaning that one or more antibiotics are chosen according to the germ(s) thought to be responsible for the infection. This is based on our knowledge of the bacteria most frequently encountered in the infection in question. The following table shows the microbial ecology of the main community bacterial infections, and the resulting antibiotic therapy '''([[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|prescribe an anti-infective]])'''.
