*The aim of microbiological tests is to :
**identify the cause of sepsis when it is not clinically obvious
**guide the secondary adaptation of antibiotic treatment, depending on the germ isolated and its antibiogram.
*The sensitivity of these tests decreases rapidly after antibiotics are introduced. As far as possible, therefore, they should be taken before antibiotics are introduced.
**In some cases, these tests cannot be carried out immediately (e.g. lumbar puncture if there is a risk of cerebral involvement).
**In these circumstances, antibiotics should be started without delay, and the sample taken as soon as possible; other arguments may be used to adapt the antibiotic treatment.

*Blood cultures are systematically taken:
**2 pairs of blood cultures (4 vials; 2 aerobic and 2 anaerobic) are taken in a single puncture before antibiotics are introduced.
**The full result of a positive blood culture will not be available until several hours after the start of management of the sepsis, or even several days for the antibiogram ''([[Positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]])'''. This test is nonetheless invaluable, particularly in cases of persistent diagnostic doubt.
