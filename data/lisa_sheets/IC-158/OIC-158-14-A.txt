Management of septic shock must be initiated without delay and then referred to a resuscitator.

The main lines of immediate treatment are as follows:

1- '''Preparing the patient:'''

* Perfusion with one or two good calibre venous lines '''([[Prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach SD-271|prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach]])''''
* Placement of a urinary catheter in the event of haemodynamic or renal failure.
* Close monitoring of vital parameters (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>) using a monitor.


2- '''Introduce antibiotic therapy quickly:''' any delay in initiating antibiotic therapy active against the causative germ leads to an increase in mortality ''([[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|prescribe an anti-infective]])'''.


3- '''Initiate the treatment of failures'' :

* Haemodynamic failure: start volume expansion by intravenous infusion of crystalloid solution (physiological saline).
* Respiratory failure: in the event of hypoxaemia, supply oxygen at an appropriate rate, to achieve an SpO<sub>2</sub> â‰¥92%.
* Management of other failures requires the intervention of a resuscitator.


The management of serious infections in children follows the same principles. The particularities are as follows:

* Monitoring of diuresis using a collector
* As it may be difficult to insert a venous line, intraosseous infusion is more frequently used.
