- In any febrile patient, it is necessary to look for signs of seriousness by looking for organ failure (cf [[Recognising a patient at risk 2C-158-IU-A01]]) '''([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia - fever]])'''.

- In the event of arterial hypotension in a febrile patient, a state of septic shock must be immediately considered and appropriate treatment must be initiated without delay.

- A significant proportion of patients with infections do not present with a fever on initial assessment. Hypothermia may also be observed ''([[Hypothermia SD-045|hypothermia]]]''. This is more frequently observed in elderly and immunocompromised subjects.

* It is therefore important to consider a septic origin in a patient presenting with arterial hypotension with no other obvious cause.
* If there is any doubt about a septic origin in a patient presenting with shock, the appropriate treatment should be started immediately (microbiological sampling followed by antibiotic therapy).

- In young children, certain signs, observed early in serious infections, should be looked for '''([[Hypotonia/infant malaise SD-046|hypotonia/infant malaise]]''':

* Sinus tachycardia
* Polypnoea
* Weak, plaintive or high-pitched cries
* Abnormal reaction to parental stimuli
* Altered vigilance
* Loss of smile
* Abnormal skin colouration (cyanosis, purpura, etc.), longer skin recolouring time
* Dehydration
