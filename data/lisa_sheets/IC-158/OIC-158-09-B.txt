In addition to microbiological examinations, the first-line work-up in sepsis or septic shock is used to ''assess organ failure'', in order to adapt resuscitation manoeuvres.

The balance sheet must include the following information:

*Arterial gasometry (or venous or capillary in children) with lactate levels to look for respiratory failure, as well as cellular suffering (hyperlactatemia) '''([[Bicarbonate analysis SD-197|bicarbonate analysis]], [[Analysis of a blood gas result SD-192|analysis of a blood gas result]])'''''
*Blood ionogram, urea, creatininaemia: search for renal failure.
*Liver count with bilirubinemia: to check for renal failure
*Blood count with platelet count, and possibly an extended coagulation test: to check for haemodynamic failure.
*Chest X-ray is systematic (to check for pulmonary oedema, the gold standard of imaging), as is the electrocardiogram.
*Troponin and BNP (or NT-pro-BNP) may be requested if cardiac failure is suspected.
