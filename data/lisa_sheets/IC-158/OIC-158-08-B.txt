Blood cultures are systematically taken in cases of sepsis/septic shock. Other microbiological tests will depend on the suspected origin of the infection:

*Suspicion of pulmonary infection: respiratory specimen (ECBC, search for respiratory viruses), legionella +/- pneumococcal antigenuria.
*Suspicion of meningitis: lumbar puncture (observe contraindications; see indications for brain imaging before LP, cf [[Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children|item 151]]) '''([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]])'''''
*Suspicion of urinary infection: ECBU '''([[Analysis of a cytobacteriological examination of the urine (ecbu) SD-189|analysis of a cytobacteriological examination of the urine (ECBU)]])''', possibly by urinary catheterisation in the event of anuria
*suspicion of skin infection: sampling of any collections
*Suspicion of malaria: blood smear - thick drop
