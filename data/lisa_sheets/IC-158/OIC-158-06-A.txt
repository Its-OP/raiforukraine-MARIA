The diagnosis of septic shock is primarily clinical.

Diagnosing septic shock in a patient presenting with an infection requires :

*identify "haemodynamic failure": mean arterial pressure ≤ 65 mmHg despite sufficient volume expansion
*measure the concentration of lactate in the blood
**The lactate level is in most cases obtained by arterial gasometry.
**By definition, the lactate level is increased (≥ 2 mmol/L) in septic shock.
