''Purpura fulminans'' is a rapidly progressive vascular purpura ''([[Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma]], [[Rash in children SD-037|rash in children]])'''.

* It appears as rapidly spreading ecchymotic and necrotic lesions.
* It is often associated with fever and haemodynamic failure.

Untreated purpura fulminans is rapidly fatal. It is therefore crucial to recognise this condition as soon as possible and to initiate appropriate treatment without delay, including emergency antibiotic therapy.

'''A febrile purpura is a ''purpura fulminans'' until proven otherwise.'''
