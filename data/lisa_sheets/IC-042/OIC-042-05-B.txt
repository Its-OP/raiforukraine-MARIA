The primary cause of secondary uterine amenorrhoea is of course pregnancy, followed by synechiae''. A history of endo-uterine curettage (by suction or curette), uterine revision, haemorrhagic childbirth, conisation, cervical electrocoagulation, cervical brachytherapy, etc. should be sought on questioning. The diagnosis of synechia is sometimes made on ultrasound, but above all on hysterosalpingography, hysterosonography or hysteroscopy. Genital tuberculosis, which causes characteristic uterine synechiae, has become exceptional in France.
