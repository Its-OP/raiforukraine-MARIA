PCOS is the most frequent cause of amenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism. It is also the leading cause of anovulation, infertility ([[Difficulty in procreating SD-033|difficulty in procreating]]) in women, affecting 5-10% of women of childbearing age.

Increased synthesis and secretion of androgens by the ovaries is an essential feature of PCOS.

This hyperandrogenism is thought to result in an excess of small growing follicles (visible on ultrasound), probably due to an anti-apoptotic effect and a slowing of follicular kinetics. In addition, in PCOS there is often a failure to select the dominant follicle, probably due to an inhibitor of FSH action, which could be the anti-mÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) found to be very high in PCOS.

Overweight and hyperinsulinism, which aggravate hyperandrogenism and dysovulation, are by no means constant and are not included in the diagnostic criteria.

The criteria used to diagnose PCOS are as follows:

*oligo- and/or anovulation;
*clinical and/or biological hyperandrogenism;
*sonographic appearance of polymicrocystic ovaries (presence of at least 20 follicles 2 to 9 mm in diameter on at least 1 ovary and/or increase in ovarian volume > 10 ml).

Two out of three criteria are sufficient'' to retain the diagnosis of PCOS, ''after exclusion of other aetiologies'' of hyperandrogenism and/or dysovulation. A 17-hydroxyprogesterone assay is therefore essential to rule out a 21-hydroxylase block, the main differential diagnosis for hyperandrogenism in PCOS. Similarly, total testosterone levels can be used to rule out a tumoral cause of hyperandrogenism of ovarian or adrenal origin, but hirsutism ([[Hirsutism SD-079]]) is then severe and there are signs of virilisation'' (clitoral hypertrophy, male voice, frontotemporal gulfs, hypertrophy of muscle masses).
