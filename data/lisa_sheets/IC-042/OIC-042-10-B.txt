''<u>Question identical in pituitary adenoma, college endocrinology</u> ([[Pituitary Adenoma]])''

The first step is to check the prolactin dosage in another laboratory:

In order to avoid big-big prolactinaemia (clusters of prolactin molecules which distort the assay but are not pathological), which depends on the assay technique, and to confirm true hyperprolactinaemia.

The main causes of hyperprolactinaemia are :

*pregnancy and breast-feeding (physiological causes)
*Therapeutics leading to an increase in prolactin (anti-emetics, neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, morphine, high-dose estrogens, etc.).
*peripheral hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency

Importance in a context of pituitary origin of knowing the importance of the prolactin value: [[Pituitary adenoma]]

*<u>Hyperprolactinaemia of pituitary origin</u>: pituitary MRI work-up to look for a prolactin adenoma (microadenoma: prolactin<200ng/ml, prolactin macroadenoma >200ng/ml), a non-prolactin macroadenoma or another lesion responsible for compression of the stalk (disconnection hyperprolactinaemia, <200ng/ml)
