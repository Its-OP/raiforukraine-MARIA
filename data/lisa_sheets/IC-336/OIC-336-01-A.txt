- Coma = acute impairment of alertness + impairment of consciousness


- Demonstrated by the patient's lack of response despite verbal, tactile or painful stimulation (increasing intensity).


- Vigilance = opening of the eyes and presence of an old-sleep rhythm (spontaneous alternation between opening and closing of the eyes, or after stimulation).


- Consciousness = presence of interaction with the environment. By definition, eye tracking is sufficient to classify the patient as conscious, even if they are classified as minimally conscious.


- NB: you have to be alert to be conscious; you can be alert without being conscious (vegetative state).
