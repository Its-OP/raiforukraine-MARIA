- Better motor response to nociceptive stimuli

- State of the pupils (photomotor reflex) :

o Myosis >> opioid toxidrome

o Unilateral mydriasis >> temporal engagement until proven otherwise

o Bilateral mydriasis >> tricyclic antidepressant toxidrome or severe neurological impairment

- Eye movements :

o The axis of the 2 eyes is parallel overall (slight exophoria in reality). If this parallelism is lost, suggest a lesion of the brain stem (basilar trunk thrombosis +++, brain stem haematoma).

o Pendular movements of the eyeballs (slow, regular movements from left to right and right to left) are not localising, often associated with coma of intermediate depth.

o Unilateral or bilateral VI paralysis is not localising (length of nerve pathway) >> HTIC
