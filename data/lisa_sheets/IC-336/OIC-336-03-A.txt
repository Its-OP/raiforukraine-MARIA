- Lack of response from the patient despite verbal, tactile or painful stimulation (increasing intensity) in a patient with eyes closed who appears unconscious.

- Make sure there is a central pulse, otherwise treat as a cardiorespiratory arrest.

- Make sure there is no trauma, if not, treat as a traumatic coma

- Assessment of depth using nociceptive stimuli: pressure on the nail beds of the four limbs and pressure on the temporo-mandibular region (Pierre Marie and Foix manoeuvre).

- Systematically achieving a Glasgow score
