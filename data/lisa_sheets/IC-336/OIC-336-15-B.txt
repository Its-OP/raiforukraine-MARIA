- If GCS < 8 and no rapidly reversible cause, orotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation

- Maintaining homeostasis / preventing ACSOS :

o Maintain normal blood sugar levels

o Maintain normal temperature (avoid hyperthermia but also hypothermia)

o Maintain normal BP (avoid hypovolaemia)

o Control of natraemia, PaCO2

o Avoid hypoxaemia

- Prefer infusion of physiological saline (isotonic) to infusion of glucose (hypotonic) as a base infusion.

- Mobilisation and prevention of decubitus complications
