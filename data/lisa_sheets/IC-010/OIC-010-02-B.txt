Bodily experience is the immediate and intimate awareness we have of our own bodies. Our bodies can be seen or touched by others, but only we can experience them from the inside. We therefore have a different perception of our own body and the bodies of others. This difference is exacerbated in the case of patients, who experience the unique nature of an illness in their own bodies, and can be a source of dissension between carers and patients. Carers, being healthy, tend to see illness as a physical phenomenon requiring medical intervention, whereas for patients the experience of illness has an impact on their whole life. The patient's experience of illness triggers a search for meaning and gives rise to feelings (shame, fear) or behaviours (blame) that considerably increase their suffering.

By analysing the experience of pain, we can understand how illness alters our experience of the body.

Pain is not just a physiological fact; it is first and foremost a fact of existence. It is not the body that suffers, but the whole individual, in terms of the meaning and value of his or her life. Pain thus affects the sense of identity. People no longer recognise themselves for who they were. The people around them change their behaviour towards them. For better or for worse, pain profoundly transforms the person affected by it. It is not confined to an organ or a function; it is also moral. Toothache is not just in the tooth, it affects every aspect of a person's life.
