'''Macular syndrome''' is a set of symptoms that variably combines a drop in visual acuity with central scotoma, metamorphopsia, macro/micropsia, dyschromatopsia, photophobia and/or a decrease in contrast sensitivity.

It is generally caused by the presence of fluid in the macula (macular oedema or retinal serous detachment), an epiretinal membrane or a macular hole.


'''Screening for macular syndrome is based on:'''

''In ophthalmological consultation:''

- a medical history looking for the symptoms mentioned above

- looking for a drop in corrected distance and near visual acuity

- optical coherence tomography (OCT): this reveals anatomical damage to the macula (oedema, retinal serous detachment, atrophy)


''Self-screening by the patient:''

- Amsler grid: Search for a central scotoma or metamorphopsia, which can be detected by looking with one eye, then the other, at the central point of the Amsler grid, which is made up of a regular grid. In the case of macular syndrome, part of the grid is not seen (scotoma) or the grid is distorted (metamorphopsia).
