'''Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)''' is damage to the macula, occurring in subjects over the age of 50, involving one or more of the following retinal abnormalities: ''drusen'', alterations to the retinal pigment epithelium (PE), geographical atrophy of the pigment epithelium or choroidal neovascularisation.

The damage is uni- or bilateral, but may be asymmetric. The term age-related maculopathy (AMD) refers to the early stages. The term AMD refers to the advanced stages (atrophic or exudative AMD), characterised in functional terms by reduced visual acuity and/or metamorphopsia. In English, the following terms are used: ''early age-related macular degeneration (MLA)'' and ''advanced AMD including atrophic AMD and exudative AMD (DMLA)''.

'''MLA (age-related maculopathy):''' early stages with little or no functional impact, with :

*drusen" (lipid deposits under the retinal pigment epithelium);
*pigmentary alterations consisting of a coexistence of proliferation and atrophy of the cells of the pigmentary epithelium.  These forms are compatible with normal or slightly reduced visual acuity.

''Advanced AMD'' corresponds to two aspects that may coexist:

*the "atrophic form", also known as the "dry form";
*the exudative or neovascular form, initially known as the "wet form".
