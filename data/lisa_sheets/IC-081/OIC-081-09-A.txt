Cataracts are defined by the <nowiki/>'''opacification of all or part of the crystalline lens.'''

It is a very common pathology, and cataract surgery is the most frequent of all surgical procedures (around 700,000 procedures per year in France).


'''<u>Primary causes:</u>'''

1. age-related cataracts

This is the most common. It is usually bilateral and generally symmetrical.


'''2. Traumatic cataracts

They are :

*or "contusive": a violent contusion to a closed globe, even a long-standing one, should be sought. The cataract is often of the posterior subcapsular type (rosette appearance). A contusive cataract may develop in the hours that follow, or several years later;
*or related to "perforating trauma": although the context is usually suggestive, some trauma may go unnoticed, particularly in children, and an intraocular foreign body should be sought (X-rays or CT scan of the orbit).


'''3. Cataracts secondary to ophthalmological diseases''''

The diseases concerned are as follows:

*chronic uveitis (particularly posterior uveitis, which requires prolonged corticosteroid therapy of more than 3 months): the inflammatory disease may be responsible, but corticosteroids must also be used;
*severe myopia;
*pigmentary retinopathies;
*history of eye surgery (retinal detachment, vitrectomy).


'''4. Secondary metabolic cataracts''''

*Diabetes
*More rarely, hyperparathyroidism

'''5. Secondary iatrogenic cataracts''''

The following may be involved:

*long-term local or general corticosteroids (posterior subcapsular form);
*orbital radiotherapy (choroidal melanoma, orbital tumours).


'''6. Cataracts secondary to genetic diseases''''

These may include :

*Steinert's myotonic dystrophy, often associated with cataracts, ptosis, motor disorders and a heart rhythm disorder;
*trisomy 21.


'''7. Congenital cataracts''''

They can be :

*secondary to an embryofoetopathy, in particular congenital rubella;
*hereditary

'''<u><br />Clinical diagnosis:</u>''''

'''Functional signs:''''

*a "drop in visual acuity": this is progressive and predominates in distance vision, with near vision often relatively unaffected (except in the case of posterior subcapsular cataracts);
*photophobia": the presence of coloured halos around lights (linked to the diffraction of light at the level of crystalline opacities), making it difficult to drive at night;
*monocular diplopia" (rarer): the patient sees double in one eye (no disappearance when one eye is occluded);
*a change in colour perception: "yellowing" (this sign is most often described after surgery on the first eye, and is found in the non-operated eye).


'''Clinical signs:'''

The diagnosis is clinical and is made during a slit lamp examination, which reveals the presence of opacities in the lens. Their anatomical distribution will define several types of cataract. The main types are :

*nuclear cataract: damage to the crystalline nucleus, predominantly reduced distance visual acuity, index myopia;
*posterior subcapsular cataract": saucer-shaped opacification in front of the posterior capsule, impaired distance and near vision. Think of metabolic and iatrogenic origin;
*cortical cataract": opacification in the crystalline cortex;
*total cataract": very advanced cataract visible to the naked eye, white pupil area.
