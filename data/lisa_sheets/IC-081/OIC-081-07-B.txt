AMD is the leading cause of visual impairment after the age of 50 in industrialised countries.

The overall prevalence of the disease is 18% after the age of 50, broken down into 17.5% for incipient forms and 0.5% for advanced forms. These figures increase with age. In Europe, the prevalence of early AMD is 16%, 25% and 37% at ages 65, 75 and 85 respectively. The prevalence of advanced forms is 0.5%, 2% and 8% from the ages of 65, 75 and 85 respectively, with atrophic forms being more common than neovascular forms.

According to a meta-analysis, 50 million people in Europe suffer from early-stage AMD and 2.5 million from advanced AMD, which in France corresponds to 4.4 million and 200,000 sufferers respectively.

In a European study (Eureye study, 2006) the frequency of "symptomatic" AMD (atrophic and exudative forms) was approximately :

* 1% before age 70;
* 3% between ages 70 and 80;
* 12% after the age of 80.  Finally, the risk of bilateralisation at 5 years is estimated at 50% for exudative AMD.
