Cataract, mainly of the senile age, is a very common pathology, and cataract surgery is the most frequently performed surgery of all (approximately 700,000 procedures per year in France).

The increase in the frequency of this disease, which is usually age-related, is therefore linked to the ageing of the population.


It is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide after uncorrected ametropia, with a large proportion of the world's population lacking access to surgery.
