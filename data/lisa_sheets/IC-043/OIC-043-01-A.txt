The origin of [[Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy) SD-112|genital bleeding]] (bleeding from the vagina) is determined by speculum examination: vaginal, cervical or endo-uterine (metrorrhagia or menorrhagia).

== '''Definitions'''==
- ''Normal menstruation'': duration between 3 and 6 days and blood loss < 80 mL.

- Menorrhagia: periods that are too heavy in volume or duration.

- ''Metrorrhagia'': genital bleeding between periods.

- ''Menometrorrhagia'': menorrhagia + metrorrhagia.

==''Bleeding is quantified by'''==
- questioning: number of fillings, clots, clothing stained by bleeding, symptoms of anaemia.

- Higham score for menorrhagia ;
