- Pelvic ultrasound is performed abdominally and endovaginally as the 1st line of defence, to look for myomas, adenomyosis, uterine polyps, ovarian cysts, arteriovenous malformations, and to assess the thickness and regularity of the endometrium (particularly in post-menopausal women).

- Pelvic MRI is useful in the 2nd<sup>nd</sup> intention''', to map a polymyomatous uterus, to characterise an ovarian cyst that is undetermined or suspicious on ultrasound, in cases of histologically proven endometrial or cervical cancer (locoregional extension), to assess the uterine cavity when this is inaccessible by hysteroscopy.
