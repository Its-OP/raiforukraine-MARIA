==Endometrial biopsy ==
An endometrial biopsy should be carried out in any patient over the age of 45 or if there is a risk factor for endometrial cancer.

The sample is taken with a CornierÂ® pipelle or by directed hysteroscopy.

The aim of the biopsy is to diagnose endometrial cancer or atypical glandular hyperplasia.

'''A biopsy cannot rule out endometrial cancer with certainty, even if it is normal''' In the case of post-menopausal metrorrhagia, an operative hysteroscopy should be performed.

==Cervico-uterine smear ==
The result of a cervico-uterine smear (cytology) is distorted by the presence of blood.

==Cervical biopsy ==
Biopsy of the uterine cervix is carried out systematically in the event of a suspicious appearance of the cervix on speculum examination, or guided by colposcopy in the context of an abnormal cervico-uterine smear.
