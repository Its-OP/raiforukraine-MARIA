Renal failure is present in almost 20% of patients diagnosed with myeloma.

Diagnostic criterion ("R" in the CRAB criteria)

Therapeutic urgency: life-threatening situation and major impact on therapeutic management


Main cause = myeloma-cell nephropathy

linked to tubular precipitation of light chains with uromodulin (Tamm Horsfall protein)

induces acute tubular necrosis

more frequent in light chain myeloma


Other common causes of renal failure in myeloma :

- Hypercalcaemia (via dehydration)

- Iatrogenic causes (NSAIDs +++, iodinated contrast media, etc.)

- Functional or obstructive causes: urinary globe (on morphine), dehydration, etc.


More rarely :

Renal failure linked to immunoglobulin deposition disease (AL amyloidosis, Randall)


Importance of analysing proteinuria :

overload proteinuria linked to the presence of light chains versus significant albuminuria, raising the possibility of associated glomerular nephropathy (e.g. AL amyloidosis)
