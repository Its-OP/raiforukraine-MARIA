Peak of monoclonal appearance

- Narrow band peak on serum protein electrophoresis

- Corresponding to the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin

- Migration more often in the gamma globulin zone, less frequently in the beta zone

- Immunofixation confirms the presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin and identifies the isotype: heavy chain (G, A, M, D, E) and light chain (kappa or lambda).


Criteria for defining monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)

- Presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin secretion in blood < 30 g/L

'''And'''

- Bone marrow plasmacytosis < 10

'''And'''

- Absence of "CRAB" symptoms (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, bone lesions)


Incidence of monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance

Very common: 3% after age 50, 5 to 10% after age 70


Evolutionary risk of monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance :

1% risk of progression per year to: multiple myeloma (MGUS IgG or IgA), Waldenstrom's disease (MGUS IgM), other low-grade lymphoma, AL amyloidosis)
