Main ways in which multiple myeloma is discovered


- Sometimes discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic patient (indolent myeloma)

- Anaemic syndrome

- Bone pain (axial skeleton++, inflammatory rhythm) and/or pathological fractures (vertebral compression, long bone fracture)

- Acute renal failure

- Hypercalcaemia

- Sometimes revealing complications :

(a) Infection (especially encapsulated germs: pneumococcus, meningococcus, haemophilus)

(b) Spinal cord compression / cauda equina syndrome

(c) Superficial and/or deep plasmacytoma (plasmacytic tumour involving bone structures or visceral involvement)

            (d) immunoglobulin deposition diseases (e.g. AL amyloidosis)


Indolent or asymptomatic multiple myeloma

- Presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin secretion in the blood > 30 g/L

'''And/or'''

- Bone marrow plasmacytosis > 10

'''And'''

- Absence of CRAB symptoms


In a patient with asymptomatic myeloma, the presence of one of the following 3 criteria now leads to the disease being considered as "symptomatic" with the need for treatment: (a) bone marrow plasmacytosis > 60%, (b) light chain ratio > 100, (c) presence of more than one focal lesion on MRI or PET scan.
