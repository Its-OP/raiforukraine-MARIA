- Medical emergency (especially if ''3.7 mmol/L [150 mg/L]'')

- Frequent complication of myeloma (revealing in 15 to 30% of cases)

- Criterion "C" for CRAB symptoms: > 2.75 mmol/L or >0.25 mmol/L above normal

- Secondary to bone lysis by tumour plasma cells

- Symptoms :

Asthenia, intense thirst, polyuro-polydipsic syndrome, abdominal pain, constipation, confusion. May sometimes be asymptomatic.

- Biology :

Hypercalcaemia (ionised calcium, calcaemia corrected with albumin++)

search for associated renal failure

- ECG +++:

search for conduction disorders: BAV, short ST segment, short QT,

look for rhythm disorders (risk of ventricular fibrillation),

Ã¨ Life-threatening


- Support :

Hospitalisation, hyperhydration with physiological serum, IV biphosphonates (caution if associated renal failure), emergency aetiological treatment (corticotherapy). Monitoring (including weight and diuresis+++). If major hypercalcaemia with acute renal failure and/or abnormal ECG: intensive care unit with scope, consider extra renal purification).
