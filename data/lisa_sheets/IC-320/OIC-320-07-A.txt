'''Demonstration of a serum or urinary monoclonal gammapathy'''

- Serum protein electrophoresis (SPE)

Narrow band peak corresponding to the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin

Migrating most often into the gamma globulin zone, less frequently into the beta zone)

If light chain myeloma (20% of cases): absence of monoclonal peak, hypogammaglobulinaemia


- Immunofixation (IF)

Confirms the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin

Enables its heavy chain and light chain to be typed (isotype)

Myeloma: IgG++, IgA+ (D, E, M exceptional)

                 Light chain κ in 2/3 of cases, λ in one third of cases.


- Determination of serum free light chains

Essential for light chain myeloma (diagnostic and follow-up value) and for the assessment of indolent myeloma (theoretical criterion for treatment if ratio >100).

Imbalance in the κ/λ ratio. Quantification of light chain produced in excess


- Bence-Jones proteinuria.

Systematic urinary sediment analysis for the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy

Bence Jones proteinuria: abnormal presence of monotypic light chains in the urine

In myeloma, in the event of glomerular-type proteinuria (albuminuria greater than 1 g/24 h): suspect associated glomerular nephropathy (e.g. AL amyloidosis or other Ig deposition disease (Randall's disease, etc.).
