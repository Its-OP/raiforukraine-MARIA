=1.     Identify a [[Headache SD-118|headache]]=
- '''Adult and child of talking age''': the patient complains of pain perceived in the cranial cavity, with or without associated facial pain.

- Infants and small children: atypical clinical picture: fits of agitation, head rolled in all directions in the cradle with shrill cries, hostility, algesic mobilisation of the head, or on the contrary a prostrate, analgesic attitude.

=2.     Reasoning when faced with a headache=
- '''Primary headaches''' are the most common (migraine, tension headache, facial vasculitis, '''item 99'') and are linked to activation of the cephalic nociceptive systems, without any underlying lesion.

- Secondary headaches have a variety of causes, some of which are very serious. Headache is the main and sometimes only symptom of a local lesion or a general pathology.

- The primary objective of any headache is to distinguish between a primary headache, a benign secondary headache (refractive error) and a headache secondary to a serious condition requiring urgent investigation and treatment (meningeal haemorrhage).

=3.      Interrogation=
- '''Temporal profile''': crucial part of the diagnostic approach with 4 key questions:

- Have you ever had this type of headache (unusual or habitual)?

- How long have you had this headache (recent or long-standing)?

- How long did it take for the headache to reach its peak? (sudden or gradual nature)

- How has the pain evolved since it began (paroxysmal or continuous)?

- '''Other features:'''

- If long-standing: number of headache days / month for the last 3 months (episodic or daily)

- Duration of each episode/crisis: minutes, hours, days

- Location, time of day, type, intensity (VAS from 0 to 10)

- Triggering and aggravating factors

- Positional character (headache relieved or aggravated by decubitus?)

- Behaviour: calm, prostrate, goes into the dark, agitated

- '''Context of occurrence:'''

- Family and personal history, vascular risk factors

- Context: new drug, toxic, carbon monoxide exposure; trauma; pregnancy or post-partum; systemic diseases (cancer, HIV); recent procedure with dural invasion or risk of invasion?

- Psychiatric situation, repercussions (sleep, work, social life, schooling)

- '''Associated signs:'''

- Digestive: [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]

- Sensory: photophobia, phonophobia

- Facial dysautonomia: lacrimation, nasal congestion, [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], miosis, [[Red and/or painful eye SD-152|eye redness]], [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|eye edema]]

- Other pains: cervical, lumbar, limb girdles

- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, chills]]

- Motor and/or sensory deficit of the limbs|Focal neurological deficit]], [[Convulsions SD-120|epileptic seizures]], [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]], visual impairment, eclipses

- '''Treatment taken for headaches:''' types of treatment (crisis or preventive), length of time taken, dose, effectiveness, side effects, number of days of painkillers taken per month

=4.      Physical examination=
- To look for abnormalities that could guide further investigations.

- Normal in primary headaches (except dysautonomic signs of a facial vascular attack)

- General: blood pressure, temperature (beware of taking antipyretics, which can mask a fever), heart auscultation and skin examination (purpura).

- '''Neurological:''' consciousness, meningeal syndrome (stiff neck), focal deficit, particularly cerebellar syndrome (ataxia may go unnoticed in a patient lying down and vomiting).

- '''Neuro-ophthalmological''': visual field (homonymous lateral hemianopia), oculomotor paralysis (III or VI?), pupillary asymmetry (myosis/mydriasis), [[Palpebral anomalies SD-139|ptosis]], (± papilledema on fundus).

- Local: inspection/palpation of skull, temporal arteries (if > 50 years old), eyeballs, ears, scalp (shingles), temporomandibular joints, neck.

- ''Postural character'': assess the intensity of the headache in the standing position and then in the lying position.

- Infant: fontanel (bulging?), cranial perimeter (increased?).

=5.      Determination of acute or chronic nature=
([[Chronic pain SD-035|chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]]; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]]; [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]])

- '''Any acute headache (in the sense of recent and unusual)''' is '''secondary''' until proven otherwise and requires urgent investigations. '''In practice:'''

- Any sudden headache is a [[Arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces|subarachnoid haemorrhage]] (SAH) until proven otherwise.

- Any progressive headache is a syndrome of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) until proven otherwise.

- Any febrile headache with no other obvious cause is meningitis until proven otherwise.

- Certain red flags (Tables 1 and 2) can help guide the diagnosis.

- Any recent change in an old, habitual headache raises the suspicion of a secondary headache.


- A ''chronic'' (in the sense of long-standing and habitual) headache is most often ''primary''. The interview must be perfectly detailed, as the diagnosis is based solely on the description of the headache. In practice, a distinction is made between :

- Chronic episodic headaches (<15 headache days per month): episodic migraine and episodic tension headache

- Chronic daily headaches (CCQ, 15 days or more per month) subdivided into :

§ Long-term QCC (seizures > 4 hours) :

§ Short-term QCC (attacks < 4 hours)


Box 1. Red flags on examination and causes to suspect''

'''Age > 50 years ± deterioration of general condition ± claudication of the jaw:''' temporal arteritis

Worsening in the recumbent position: intracranial hypertension (ICHT)

Aggravation in standing position: intracranial hypotension

'''Recent dural rupture''' (LP, epidural, spinal nerve infiltration): intracranial hypotension

'''Defective heating:''' carbon monoxide poisoning

'''Cervicalgia:''' cervical artery dissection

'''Sudden onset:''' subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and other vascular causes

'''Progressive onset''': HTIC

Cardiovascular risk factors: stroke

'''Risk factors for venous thrombosis'' (oral contraception): cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)

Uncontrolled HIV infection: cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis

'''Neoplasia''': metastasis, carcinomatous meningitis

Postpartum: reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RVCS), eclampsia, CVT, intracranial hypotension (if epidural)

'''Taking vasoactive substances''' (drugs; serotonergics; α-sympathomimetics): SVCR

''Stress-induced or orgasmic'': SAH, SVCR

Induced by a Valsalva manoeuvre (coughing, defecation, sneezing): HTIC, SVCR

Cranial trauma: cerebral haemorrhage, subdural haematoma, traumatic SAH

Spinal trauma: cervical arterial dissection, intracranial hypotension

'''Vomiting''' : HTIC


Box 2. Red flags at examination and causes to suspect''

'''Hypertension:'''' SAH, stroke, CRS, hypertensive encephalopathy >> simple hypertensive crisis

'''Fever''': infectious causes (meningitis or general infection)

'''Meningeal stiffness''': HSA, meningitis

'''Focal neurological deficit ± epilepsy''': SAH, stroke, CVT, meningoencephalitis, tumour, complicated CVRS

'''Paediatric specificities:''''

'''Diagnosis by questioning, 2 questions:''' have you ever had this type of headache? How long have you had this type of headache?

- Ability to describe pain varies according to the age and development of the child = do not underestimate it - but often questioning, especially of the parents = semiology difficult to analyse.

- Identify the temporal pattern of headaches (recent or chronic) and their characteristics (location, intensity, duration, typology, frequency, associated symptoms)

- The child's condition between episodes of headache (growth, schooling, behaviour, family context, treatment, etc.).
