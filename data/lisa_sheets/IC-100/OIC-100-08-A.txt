- '''In practice:'''

o Any sudden headache should be investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.

o Any progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.

o Any febrile headache should be investigated as meningitis.

o Investigations are carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a centre with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner).

===='''1. Imaging for acute headache''' ====
([[Request for an imaging examination SD-231|request for an imaging examination]]; [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]; [[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination]])

- '''Cerebral CT scan as a matter of urgency:''' any sudden headache should be investigated by a cerebral CT scan without injection to look for a SAH, whenever possible with a cerebral angioscan immediately.

- '''In the presence of a visible SAH:''' the search for an aneurysm indicates a '''cerebral angioscanner''' if this has not already been done.

- '''In the absence of a visible SAH:''' LP is imperative.

- If no SAH is found on CT scan or LP, the search for another cause must be discussed (specialist opinion), particularly if the headache persists, and is based on arterial (SVCR), venous (TVC) and SAH (dissection) angioscanner, followed by cerebral MRI (TVC, pituitary necrosis).

o '''ASD angioscan''' must be performed for any suspected dissection ([[neck pain SD-144|cervicalgia]], Claude-Bernard-Horner, sudden headache without visible ASD).

- Imaging will be repeated a few days later (MRI+MRA or angioscan) in cases of suspected CRS with normal initial parenchymal and arterial imaging.

- After an angioscan and LP showing no aneurysmal SAH, cerebral arteriography via the femoral route is not useful.

===='''2.  Imaging for acute progressive headache'''====
- Cerebral imaging is necessary in all cases, with a variable delay

o ''Headache present or aggravated for < 7 days'': emergency imaging.

o ''Stable headache for > 7 days'': delays to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

- A full brain MRI is ideally performed immediately (T1, FLAIR, injected T1 and vascular sequences) to look for an intracranial expansive process (mass, contrast) and signs of CVT. A T2* sequence may be requested to identify bleeding or a hyposignal CVT. A fat-sat sequence (fat saturation) and MRA of the ASD are required to detect a cervical arterial dissection.

- If access to MRI is limited, a brain scan without and then with injection of contrast medium and an angioscan of the ASD will be performed. If there is no diagnosis after the scan and the headache persists, an MRI scan should be performed to look for lesions that are not easily visible on the scan (CVT, PRES, pituitary necrosis and intracranial hypotension).

- If imaging does not provide a definitive diagnosis and the headache persists, an LP should be discussed to look for meningitis or a CSF pressure disorder.
<br />

===='''3.  Imaging for chronic headache (long-standing and habitual)'''====
Carry out a cerebral MRI scan (avoid non-emergency scans as they can cause radiation) only if there is a suspicion of a secondary headache and/or a neurological disease that can cause auras (other than migraine).

- Migraine attacks starting after the age of 50

- Atypical migraine aura because of abrupt onset, duration > 60 minutes, symptoms always on the same side or absence of visual disturbance

- Chronic migraine for less than a year

- Chronic tension headache for less than a year

- Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF) at least once (rule out AVF secondary to damage to the hypothalamus, pituitary gland or posterior fossa)

- Abnormal clinical examination.


'''Paediatric particularities:''' ([[Request for a patient's explanation of the procedure, risks and expected benefits of an SD-232 imaging examination|request for a patient's explanation of the procedure, risks and expected benefits of an imaging examination]])

- The indication for brain imaging must be justified because: i) Brain MRI requires sedation or general anaesthesia until the child is old enough to remain calm (7-8 years), ii) Radiation exposure in children must be kept to a minimum.

- The indications for emergency brain imaging are: abnormal neurological examination; changes in headache; signs of HTIC; visual or oculomotor disorders; persistent or increasing frequency of vomiting; signs suggestive of hypothalamic-pituitary damage; delay or change in height.
