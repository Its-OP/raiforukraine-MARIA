- '''Chronic headache''': has been present for at least 3 months, and generally lasts for months or years.

o It is most often a primary headache.

o Assess the number of headache days per month over the last three months.

- '''Episodic chronic headache (<15 headache days / month)''''

o Migraine (known as episodic)

o Episodic tension headache

- '''Chronic daily headache (CCQ, 15 days or more / month) subdivided into'''

o ''Long-term QCC'' (seizures > 4 hours)

§ Chronic migraine if the headache has the characteristics of a migraine for at least 8 days a month

§ Chronic tension headache, if no migraine characteristic

§ Both may or may not be associated with drug abuse, which is a complication and/or aggravating factor in the underlying primary headache.

o ''Short-term QCC'' (attacks < 4 hours): facial vascular angina (FVA) and other trigeminal-autonomic headaches, mainly to be distinguished from painful cranial neuropathy (trigeminal neuralgia).

- Etiological diagnosis is based on questioning: in the presence of a chronic headache (long-standing and habitual), determine the duration of untreated attacks, the characteristics of the headache and associated signs (table). This is most often a primary headache. A distinction is made between

o '''Migraine (<u>item 99</u>)'''

§ Migraine without aura

§ Migraine with aura: progressive, successive and transient neurological disorders (< 1 hour) preceding or accompanying the headache at its onset, most often visual signs, sometimes sensory, rarely language disorders.

o '''Tension headache (<u>item 99</u>)''''

o '''Algie vasculaire de la face'''''(<u>item 99)</u>''' to be distinguished from trigeminal neuralgia

- '''Chronic post-traumatic headache:''' Long-term QCC that persists >3 months after a head injury, follows acute post-traumatic headache (< 3 months), and may be accompanied by a post-traumatic syndrome (vertigo, sleep disorders, difficulty concentrating, mood disorder). Resembles a chronic migraine or chronic tension headache.


- Chronic headache of cervical origin'': certain rheumatological conditions can cause headaches (severe osteoarthritis and/or disco-radicular conflict, sequelae of fracture/dislocation of a cervical vertebra, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.). Headaches are generally posterior with paravertebral muscle contractures.
