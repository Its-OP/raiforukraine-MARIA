- '''In practice:'''

o Any sudden acute [[Headache SD-118|headache]] is investigated as an aneurysmal SAH.

o Any acute progressive headache should be investigated as HTIC.

o Any acute headache [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|febrile]] is investigated as meningitis.

o investigations carried out in the emergency department, sometimes after the patient has been transferred to a centre with the necessary imaging capabilities (angioscanner)


- '''The patient is hospitalised if'''

o A diagnosis of severe secondary headache is made, and the assessment and aetiological treatment are continued.

o If the diagnosis has not been established and the severe headache persists, to continue investigating the aetiology and adapting the treatment, following specialist advice.


- Investigations are normal in 30 to 70% of patients seen in emergency departments for a recent unusual headache. If the patient is relieved, they can go home. This is often the first severe migraine attack.


- Indications for a lumbar puncture in the event of an acute headache'': this allows the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be analysed and the intracranial pressure to be measured. LP must be performed ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]) :

o '''Suspicion of SAH''': If the imaging is normal, an LP must be performed, even if the headache has disappeared. A xanthochromia of the supernatant ([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]]) in spectrophotometry is present in 100% of aneurysmal SAHs when the CSF is taken between 12 hours and 14 days after the onset of the headache.

o '''When infectious meningitis is suspected''': '''PL from the outset WITHOUT prior imaging or blood tests.''' There are few indications for brain imaging prior to LP. A blood test is carried out at the same time (blood culture and systematic blood glucose to interpret the glycorrhaphy).

o '''When there is a suspicion of HTIC''' and '''AFTER''' non-diagnostic brain imaging, an LP must be performed to confirm the diagnosis by measuring pressure in the left lateral decubitus position (HTIC if >25 cm of water), to look for chronic meningitis and to relieve the headache by subtracting CSF. A fundus examination will also be carried out.

o After imaging in all other acute headaches without a definite aetiological diagnosis after imaging ([[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination]]).

|'''Lumbar puncture is the key emergency test for any suspected case of infectious meningitis (severe headache + fever)''''
|- It must be carried out within one hour of the patient's admission to the emergency department, without any prior brain imaging or biological work-up.

- Isolated [[Coma and disorder of consciousness SD-028|disorder of consciousness]] is NOT a contraindication to LP.

- Indications for brain imaging prior to LP are rare

- If an LP cannot be performed as quickly as possible, dexamethasone and antibiotics should be started immediately after a pair of blood cultures have been taken.

|- Extensive cutaneous infection of the puncture site

- Haemodynamic or respiratory instability

- Known haemostasis disorders (coagulopathy including haemophilia, platelets < 50,000/mm3)

- Effective anticoagulant treatment (heparin, VKA or direct oral anticoagulants)

- Spontaneous bleeding suggestive of DIC
|-
|If meningitis is suspected, the indications for imaging before LP are limited.

- Signs suggestive of an expansive process: signs of localisation and/or recent focal epileptic seizures

- '''Signs of cerebral involvement''': [[Coma and disorders of consciousness SD-028|troubles de la vigilanc]]<nowiki/>e AND pupillary abnormalities, dysautonomia, posterior tonic seizures, areactivity, decerebration or decortication reaction
