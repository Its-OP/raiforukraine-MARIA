- '''Also refer to the emergency department any patient who presents''' ([[Headache SD-118|headache]]; [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]])''' :''''

o a "brutal" headache (maximum in less than an hour), or even a thunderclap headache (maximum intensity in less than a minute) => SAH until proven otherwise;

o a headache that is ''recent or of recent aggravation'' (< 7 days) and ''unusual'' => HTIC until proven otherwise;

o headache associated with ''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|fever]]''' (in the absence of an obvious general cause such as a viral syndrome during an epidemic) => infectious meningitis;

o headache associated with "neurological signs" (anisocoria, cranial nerves, central neurological deficit);

o a headache suggestive of CO intoxication;

o headache in the context of immunodepression.


- The absence of any associated symptoms and a normal clinical examination do not rule out a secondary headache and should not delay further investigations if the headache is recent, unusual and persistent. [Reasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test SD-178|(reasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test)]]


- Migraine sufferers often present with a severe attack. If the questioning is reliable and the patient recognises "his" usual migraine attack, investigations are not necessary and treatment will be given to relieve the attack.

- Red flags in children: drop in school results; persistent unilateral localisation; epileptic seizures ([[Convulsions SD-120|convulsions]]); new-onset clumsiness; behavioural problems; change in staturo-ponderal curve; parental concern; age < 3 years (rare primary headaches); rapid increase in head circumference; murmur on auscultation of the fontanelle; recent strabismus or drop in visual acuity.<br />
