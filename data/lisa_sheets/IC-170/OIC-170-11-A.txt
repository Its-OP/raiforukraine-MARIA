The [[Travel advice SD-302|personal antivectorial protection (PPAV)]] consists of protecting yourself from the bites of the female anopheles vector, which bites mainly at night. PPAV is systematically recommended when visiting endemic areas. It should be applied systematically at dusk and throughout the night.

The most effective means of protection are :

*Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (recommended for use at night).
*Wear covering clothing, if possible impregnated with insecticide.
*Use repellent on exposed areas.
