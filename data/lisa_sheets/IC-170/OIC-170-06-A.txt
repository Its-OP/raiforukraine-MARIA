====[[Interpretation of a malaria attack SD-234|Certainty diagnosis]]====
The diagnosis of malaria is an ''EMERGENCY'' as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, even in the absence of a febrile peak. The ''result'' must be given ''within 4 hours of the sample being taken and within 2 hours of its receipt''.

The diagnosis of certainty is based on the detection of asexual intra-erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium.

=====Techniques diagnostiques=====

*Blood smear: used to identify the ''species'' and determine the ''parasitaemia'' (number of parasitised red blood cells/100).
*Thick drop (GE), concentration technique: more sensitive than the blood smear. If parasitaemia is not detectable by smear, positive diagnosis is possible.
*Molecular biology (plasmodial DNA detection): highly sensitive (at least as sensitive as EW).
*Antigen detection: rapid diagnostic tests (< 30 minutes from receipt of sample, easy to use (non-specialist laboratory), no access to molecular biology).
**Detection of at least one P. falciparum antigen.
**Variable sensitivity (lower than that of the thick drop and molecular biology), depending on the species (modest for non-"falciparum") and parasitaemia.

====Additional tests (to look for biological severity criteria)====

*NFS
*Liver function tests
*Creatinine, urea
*Blood glucose
*Blood gas
*Lactatemia
