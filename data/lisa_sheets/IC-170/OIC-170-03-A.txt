'''<big>Suspicion of malaria is a diagnostic EMERGENCY</big>''''

Suspicion of the disease is based on clinical and epidemiological evidence (compatible clinical features and evidence of a stay in an endemic area) and/or orienting biological signs.

====Symptom onset time====

=====Primo-invasion (all species)=====

*Incubation of 1 to 3 weeks on average.
*Onset of P. falciparum malaria: mostly within 3 months of the start of the stay in an endemic zone.

=====Reviviscence (''P. vivax'' or ''P. ovale'')=====

*Up to 3 to 5 years after a stay in an endemic zone

=====Late outbreak (''P. malariae'')=====

*Up to 10 years after a stay in an endemic zone

====Clinical signs of uncomplicated malaria attack====

*Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever, shivering, sweating in fits and starts with free intervals
*± Digestive disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea)
*± Headache
*± Splenomegaly

====Clinical features of severe malaria (see ''Heading: How to identify severe malaria'')====

====Biological signs of orientation====

=====NFS=====

*Thrombocytopenia (very frequent)
*Anaemia
*Absence of hyperleukocytosis or lymphopenia

=====Biochemical analysis=====

*Biological inflammatory syndrome (elevated CRP)
*haemolytic syndrome: LDH (increased), free bilirubin (increased), haptoglobin (decreased, the most sensitive test for diagnosing haemolysis)
*Hepatic cytolysis, < 10N (especially ALAT)
