Haemoptysis corresponds to subglottic bleeding. The emission of blood is therefore associated with a "coughing effort", which should be investigated on questioning. Blood emitted from the mouth is bright red and aerated.


The 2 differential diagnoses are :

- Haematemesis" = vomiting of blood: we look for efforts to vomit; digestive history

- Bleeding of ENT origin": epistaxis or bleeding of pharyngeal or laryngeal origin


If the cause of the bleeding cannot be identified on questioning, additional tests (bronchial or ENT fibroscopy; chest CT scan) are indicated to identify the cause and guide investigations with a view to etiology.
