The aims of the initial assessment are:

- d'''' assess the severity:''' clinical, initial biological work-up (including haemostasis), blood gases

- identify the site of bleeding to guide symptomatic treatment: chest X-ray; thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan

Identify the cause of the bleeding, to guide etiological treatment: chest X-ray and thoracic CT scan.

Thus, with the data from the interview, the physical examination, and the first systematic complementary examinations (biology, blood gas; chest X-ray), ''thoracic CT with injection of contrast medium at the systemic arterial time has a key place'' in management, allowing:

- locate the lesion responsible for the bleeding, or failing that, the site of the bleeding

- to "characterise the lesion responsible" and thus guide further investigations and even etiological treatment.

- to "map bronchial arterial vascularisation", and thus guide possible arterioembolisation.
