The main causes of haemoptysis are :


1- Bronchopulmonary cancer, evoked by :

- a high-risk background (smoking),

- altered general condition (AEG),

- a paraneoplastic syndrome,

- signs of local or loco-regional invasion (e.g. superior vena cava syndrome, etc.), metastases (peripheral adenopathies, skin metastases, etc.)

- a suggestive radiological appearance: mass, atelectasis, mediastinal syndrome, etc.


2- Tuberculosis, evoked by :

- high-risk terrain (history of illness, contagious diseases, etc.)

- AEG, night sweats, fever

- a suggestive radiological appearance: cavern, infiltrates of the apices


3- ''Bronchial dilatation (including cystic fibrosis)'' :

- diagnosis often already known

- long-standing daily cough and sputum with repeated infectious exacerbations

- the radiological appearance on a CT scan helps to make the diagnosis


4- Necrotizing infectious pneumonia (including fungal infections), evoked by :

- high-risk terrain: immunocompromised; pre-existing respiratory pathology

- signs of infection

- suggestive radiological aspect: abscess; aspergilloma


5- ''Vascular causes'' evoked according to the terrain and presentation:

- pulmonary embolism ;

- acute cardiogenic oedema ;

- pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (Rendu Osler disease)


6- Intra-alveolar haemorrhage:

- multiple causes (infectious; drugs, immune causes (vasculitis, etc.)...)

- suggestive radiological appearance: ground glass

- confirmed by alveolar lavage


In a certain number of cases (up to 25%), no cause is identified: haemoptysis is "idiopathic".
