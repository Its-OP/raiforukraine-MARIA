Severe haemoptysis, or haemoptysis that persists under medical treatment, should be managed in an "intensive care sector", in a centre offering advanced management: arterioembolisation, or even thoracic surgery.

The severity of haemoptysis therefore determines the treatment sector and the therapeutic strategy.

Whatever the severity of the haemoptysis, a diagnosis of the aetiology should always be made in parallel with symptomatic treatment, as a matter of urgency, and therefore systematically requires access to a thoracic angioscan.


'''As a reminder:'''

''The severity of haemoptysis is based not only on the <u>abundance</u> of bleeding, but also on the <u>underlying terrain</u> (e.g. chronic respiratory failure), and the <u>cause of bleeding</u> (e.g. excavated tumour at high risk of recurrence as massive haemoptysis).''

Treatment strategy according to severity :

*''''' medical treatment as a first line of defence: this is systematically implemented in parallel with etiological investigations:
**symptomatic treatment (oxygen) + monitoring
**vasoconstrictors (IV terlipressin or inhaled or IV tranexamic acid)
**urgent aetiological assessment: aetiological treatment is urgent if a cause at risk of recurrence in a severe form is identified (e.g. excavated lesion).

à if persistent: discuss arterioembolisation or cold surgery depending on the aetiological assessment

*''''' medical treatment + arterioembolisation''''' from the outset in cases of severe haemoptysis
**symptomatic treatment (oxygen) + monitoring + vasoconstrictors
**arterioembolisation systematically considered

à if recurrence after arterioembolisation: discuss surgical treatment depending on aetiological assessment
