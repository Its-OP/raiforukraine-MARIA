Chest X-rays are not very sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of haemoptysis. It may show :

- infiltration

- an "alveolar condensation" syndrome, or even atelectasis (in the case of bronchial obstruction by a clot or by the lesion responsible for the bleeding)

- possibly the "lesion" responsible for the haemoptysis (tumour, cavern, etc.)

The chest X-ray may be normal.



Thoracic computed tomography (CT)

is more sensitive and more specific. It can show :

- areas of "ground glass" (in this case the highest images are those corresponding to the location of the origin of the bleeding)

- condensation or atelectasis

- possibly the "lesion" responsible for the haemoptysis (tumour, cavern, etc.) (see previous question "how to ask for an initial assessment")

It is rarely normal.
