'''Main etiologies:''''

*Traumatic causes

           - Post-traumatic SAH (most frequent cause of SAH)

*Non-traumatic causes

           - Arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces|intracranial arterial aneurysm rupture]] (85% of cases): any non-traumatic SAH is a ruptured intracranial arterial aneurysm until proven otherwise.

           - Perimesencephalic SAH (10%)

           - rupture of vascular malformation (5%): intracranial arteriovenous malformation (AVM), intracranial dural fistula, mycotic aneurysm, etc.

'''Main risk factors for intracranial aneurysm:''''

           - female sex

           - high blood pressure (HTA)

           - smoking

           - chronic alcohol intoxication

           - personal history of intracranial aneurysm

           - genetic: a family history of cerebral aneurysm, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or collagen diseases (Marfan or Ehler-Danlos)

'''Factors favouring intracranial aneurysm rupture:''''

           - physical effort

           - hypertensive crisis

           - size of aneurysm
