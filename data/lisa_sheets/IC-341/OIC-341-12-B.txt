'''Overall prognosis of spontaneous SAH:''''

Aneurysmal SAH is a serious form of stroke. 20% of patients will die in the pre-hospital setting.

For patients treated in hospital :

- 60% will survive without major after-effects

- 20% will have a severe disability

- 20% will die

'''Main complications of spontaneous SAH:''''

*rebleeding of aneurysm before securing
*acute obstructive hydrocephalus
*vasospasm generating delayed cerebral ischaemia (equivalent to ischaemic stroke)
*intracranial hypertension (ICHT): secondary to cerebral oedema, acute hydrocephalus or intracranial haematoma, which can lead to death due to injury
*hyponatremia (SIADH)
*epileptic seizure (or even status epilepticus)
*communicating hydrocephalus (due to arachnoid felting, at a distance from the bleeding)

'''Cerebral vasospasm:'''

*onset between D4 and D14 after bleeding
*to be suspected if there is a recurrence of headache, hyperthermia and/or changes in the neurological examination
*daily trans-cranial doppler screening
*positive diagnosis by cerebral perfusion scan and/or cerebral angiography
