* Typical presentation: "a thunderclap in a clear sky": acute headache that is sudden, intense and immediately maximal +/- preceded by a fissure syndrome a few days earlier: any sudden intense headache is a meningeal haemorrhage until proven otherwise ('''[[Headache SD-118|headache]]'''').

* Meningeal syndrome, usually apyretic: may be absent initially.

* Signs of intracranial hypertension +/- disorders of consciousness up to coma ('''[[Coma and disorders of consciousness SD-028|coma et troubles de la conscience]]''').

* Inaugural convulsive seizure ('''[[Convulsions SD-120|convulsions]]''').

* Focal signs ('''[[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]'''''): sensory and/or motor deficit in the case of cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage; homolateral III paralysis in the case of compression by a large aneurysm of the internal carotid artery.

* Vegetative signs: tachycardia, arterial hypertension, Cushing's reaction, heart rhythm disorders, bradycardia or even cardiac arrest.
