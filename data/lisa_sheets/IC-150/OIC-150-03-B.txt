*Infection via the eustachian tube from the nasopharynx
*Adaptation disease'': immune learning after loss of maternal immunity
*Prolonged nasopharyngeal infections and hypertrophy of the adenoids => microbial pullulation and stasis of secretions in the nasopharynx.
*Factors favouring AOM in young children:
** inflammation of the nasopharynx, pollution, passive smoking, communal living; absence of breast-feeding; family history of AOM; poor living and hygiene conditions; season: autumn/winter; earliness of the first episode of AOM.
** Eustachian tube shorter, more horizontal, more permeable than adult - maturity around 6-7 years of age
** Risk of eustachian tube anomalies: cleft palate, trisomy 21, craniofacial malformation, etc.
** chronic otitis, seromucous otitis
