*Mastoiditis
**Pus oozes through the cortex of the mastoid bone (->decolouration of the pinna, inflammatory swelling in the retroauricular area).
**Otoscopy: AOM collected, posterior wall of external auditory canal collapses

*Facial paralysis
** Partial or complete
** Favoured by the absence of a bony shell in the facial pathway

*Meningitis
** Blood-borne, bone-borne or labyrinthine contamination
** Risk of labyrinthine fibrosis if pneumococcus

*Tympanic perforation (after perforated AOM) which may or may not close spontaneously

*Seromucous otitis.
** 10-20% of AOMs
** may persist 4-6 weeks after AOM

*Rare complications: labyrinthitis, thrombophlebitis of the lateral sinus, cerebral abscess, osteitis of the temporal bone, etc.
