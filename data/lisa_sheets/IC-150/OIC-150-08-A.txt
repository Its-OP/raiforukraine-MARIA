*'''Otitis externa:''''

o related to swimming or duct trauma ;

o can be bacterial or mycotic

o intense stabbing pain when the tragus is pressed or the pinna is moved, without fever; pain when chewing

o otoscope insertion painful, external auditory meatus oedematous, inflamed, whitish secretions; eardrum normal if visible

o germs: S ''aureus, P aeruginosa;'' 10% Aspergillus mycosis (filaments and black spots)

o complications: chondritis or perichondritis<br />.

*Seromucous otitis

o Chronic inflammation of the middle ear with closed eardrum; more or less thick retrotympanic effusion

o Very common, average age of onset 5 years

o Bilateral in 85% of cases

o <u>Favouring factors</u>:

ยง adenoid hypertrophy

ยง tumour of the nasopharynx (undifferentiated, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, etc.), infratemporal fossa or petrous apex; most often

unilateral in this case; fibroscopic exploration and CT/MRI scan; possibly biopsy

ยง velar division

ยง trisomy 21, immune deficiency, ciliary disease

o warning signs: hearing loss leading to language delay in infants/young children; difficulties at school in older children; sensation of a full ear.

o otoscopy: dull, amber, yellowish eardrum; retracted or bulging; or fluid level

o assess impact: flat tympanogram; pure tone audiometry - conductive hearing loss of 30-40 dB, with normal bone curve; speech assessment if there is any doubt about impact

o evolution: usually spontaneous recovery; sometimes flare-ups of AOM; sometimes tympano-ossicular sequelae (tympanic atelectasis, ossicular lysis, with residual conductive deafness); possible evolution to cholesteatoma
