*Contamination from the nasopharynx.
*Most common infection in children, especially between the ages of 6 and 24 months.
*90% of congestive AOM is viral in origin
*10% of AOMs are bacterial: pneumococcus (40%), Haemophilus influenzae (30-40%), S. aureus and epidermidis, group A streptococcus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis and anaerobes.
*H. influenzae resistance: 17% betalactamase secretion; pneumococci: 4% penicillin resistance, 42% intermediate resistance (PSDP: pneumococcus of diminished sensitivity to penicillin).
*Association with purulent conjunctivitis: pointing towards Haemophilus influenzae; fever > 38.5Â°C and severe pain: pneumococcus.

*PSDP risk factors: age <18 months, living in a community, recent AOM, recent administration of antibiotics (Penicillin A) in the last 3 months.
