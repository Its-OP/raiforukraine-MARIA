Common nevi are present in the majority of individuals.

Their natural history is as follows:

* Appearance around 4-5 years of age
* Gradual increase up to age 30
* Regression after age 60


The risk of a common nevus turning into a melanoma is very low (probability of less than 1 in 100,000).

The risk of transformation of a small congenital nevus is comparable to that of common nevi.

In the case of giant congenital nevi, the risk of transformation depends on size (the larger the nevus, the greater the risk), the presence of satellite lesions and median topography.

Repeated microtrauma does not induce the transformation of nevi into melanoma.
