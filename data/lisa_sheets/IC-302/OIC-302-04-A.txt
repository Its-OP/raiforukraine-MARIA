'''Understanding the principles of comprehensive management of carcinomas'''

For BCC, treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 4 to 10 mm (according to clinical and histological prognostic criteria).

The poor prognostic factors are location on the periorificial surface, size >2cm, sclerodermiform and recurrent forms.


For EC, treatment consists of surgical excision with safety margins of 5 to 10 mm (depending on prognostic markers).


Detailed description of the different stages of this care:

*preliminary biopsy if diagnosis uncertain or before complex surgical treatment
*consultation to announce the diagnosis
*RCP presentation (if carcinoma with poor prognosis or locally advanced)
*surgery and anatomopathological examination of the specimen:
**immediate surgical resection if diagnosis highly probable;
**simple suture removal, usually on an outpatient basis;
**if surgical excision incomplete or "borderline": revision essential.

'''Understanding the principles of comprehensive melanoma management'''

Following histological confirmation of the diagnosis of melanoma, revision surgery should be carried out to obtain a complete and wide excision of the lesion with safety margins in healthy skin. The choice of margins is dictated by the Breslow index. The following margins are recommended:

- for intraepidermal melanomas: 0.5 cm margins;

- if the Breslow index is less than or equal to 1 mm: margins of 1 cm ;

- if the Breslow index is between 1.01 and 2 mm: margins of 1 to 2 cm;

- if the Breslow index is greater than 2 mm: 2 cm margins;

For non-invasive Dubreuilh's melanoma, a margin of 1 cm is recommended.
