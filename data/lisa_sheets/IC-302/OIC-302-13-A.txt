Primary prevention consists of reducing the only known environmental factor responsible for melanoma: UV exposure.

This means encouraging photoprotection by limiting exposure during hours of strong sunlight and giving priority to clothing protection.


Secondary prevention aims to improve prognosis through early detection of melanoma. This involves training doctors, who must know how to examine their patient's integument in its entirety, spot suspicious lesions and refer to an expert correspondent in case of doubt.

It is essential to combine this with information and education on early melanoma screening for carers (nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, etc.), the general population and those most at risk of melanoma.
