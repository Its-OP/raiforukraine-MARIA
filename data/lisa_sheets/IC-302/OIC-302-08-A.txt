There are 2 main categories of nevi:

* Common melanocytic/pigmentary/acquired nevi, commonly known as "moles".) These are the most common melanocytic lesions. These benign tumours are made up of melanocytes grouped together in clusters (theca) in the epidermis and/or dermis.
* Congenital nevi present from birth. These are much rarer (1% of births). <br />

The clinical appearance of a common nevus can vary greatly (size, shape, pigmentation), but in a given individual, all the nevi usually have a comparable appearance.


Congenital nevi vary greatly in size.  Progressively, their surface may become irregular with hypertrichosis. Large congenital nevi (defined as having a projected diameter of > 20 cm in adulthood) are rare. They may even be giant and extend over a large part of the body, with a tendency towards metameric distribution, most often dorsal.


The blue nevus is a deep dermal nevus with a high melanin load.

Achromic nevi are unpigmented, usually tuberous and predominantly on the face or trunk.



Factors responsible for the development of nevi :

* Intrinsic factors: constitutional, genetic susceptibility
** Correlation between number of nevi and ethnic origin (more nevi in Caucasian > Asian > black population)
** Link between number of nevi and phototype (most common: phototype II)
** Family predisposition: density of nevi in children correlated with that of parents
* Extrinsic factors
** Environmental, behavioural: correlation between number of nevi and sun exposure
** Immunological status: Immunodepression Ã¨ Increase in the number of nevi
