Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections of the skin and mucous membranes are very common; in the skin they cause benign epithelial lesions, warts, and in the mucous membranes, condylomas.


Warts affect 7 to 10% of the general population, with a peak in frequency between the ages of 10 and 14.


Common clinical aspects of warts :

* Plantar warts: There are 2 anatomo-clinical varieties:
** myrmecia (HPV1), the most common: deep wart, painful on pressure, single or multiple; circumscribed by a thick keratotic ring partially covering the central region whose keratotic and papillomatous surface is dotted with black dots (thrombosed capillaries).
** Mosaic warts (HPV2), less common (1/4 of plantar warts): superficial, painless warts in keratotic plaques.
* Common vulgar warts (HPV2) :

Exophytic lesions, surface bristling with greyish keratotic projections, Â± crevices; variable size and number, sometimes confluent.

Localised mainly on the dorsal surface of the hands and fingers; more rarely palmares or other cutaneous localisations.

* Common flat warts (HPV3).

Small, barely raised papules, yellow or buff in colour, with a smooth or finely mamelinated surface.  They occur mainly on the face, back of the hands and limbs;

Usually resolves in less than 2 years, but can be chronic in immunocompromised patients.


Treatment of warts :

* There is no specific treatment for HPV infections.
* Patients should be informed that these lesions are benign, that there is a high risk of recurrence and that warts usually regress spontaneously; warts should not therefore be treated aggressively+++.

- Destruction (on request, on a case-by-case basis, depending on experience) using chemical keratolytics (salicylic acid-based preparations with protection of peripheral healthy skin) or physical cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen.
