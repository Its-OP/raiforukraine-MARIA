The prognosis for BCC is excellent as it is a tumour that only exceptionally metastasises.


EC is a more aggressive tumour, with a risk of distant dissemination (by lymphatic and haematogenous routes).

The poor prognostic factors of EC are :

* The size of the lesion (>2cm)
* Location on the temple, ear or lip
* A low level of histological differentiation
* Histological tumour thickness >3mm
* Perinuclear invasion
* Immunosuppression
