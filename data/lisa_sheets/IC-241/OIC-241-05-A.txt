The 3 main complications of goitre are :

* Hyperthyroidism: a drop in TSH, possibly accompanied by clinical signs of thyrotoxicosis;
* Compression of neighbouring organs: oesophagus (manifested by difficulty swallowing), trachea (which may manifest as difficulty breathing), cervical venous network (jugular turgidity, collateral circulation);
* Cancer: cancers are present in 4 to 5% of plurinodular goitres. Nodules suspected of being supra-centimetric on ultrasound should be cytopunctured.
