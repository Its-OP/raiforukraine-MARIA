Fine needle aspiration of a thyroid nodule is used to assess whether it is malignant or benign.

This examination is recommended for a thyroid nodule with normal (or elevated) TSH that presents at least one of the following criteria:

o suspicious supra-centimetre nodule on ultrasound (highly hypoechoic nodule and/or presence of microcalcifications and/or irregular contours and/or non-oval shape),

o And/ or nodule associated with suspicious cervical adenopathy(ies).

o And/or suspicious nodule fixed on FDG-PET.

Interpretation of thyroid cytology is based on the Bethesda classification, which makes it possible to estimate the risk of malignancy and to suggest a course of action according to six cytological categories
