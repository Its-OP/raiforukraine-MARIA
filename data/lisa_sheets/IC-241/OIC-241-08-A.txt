When faced with a thyroid nodule, the diagnostic approach will consist of :

# Defining whether the nodule is functional or not: 10% of nodules are hyperfunctional ("hot" on thyroid scintigraphy) with a risk of hyperthyroidism.
# Defining whether a nodule is benign or malignant: approximately 5% of thyroid nodules are cancers.
