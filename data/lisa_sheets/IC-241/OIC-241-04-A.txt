The 3 main aetiological diagnoses of goitre are :

* Graves' disease'': diffuse goitre associated with '''''[[Hyperthyroidism]]''''', and possible extra-thyroid signs (orbitopathy), typically in young women.
* Hashimoto's disease'': goitre associated with '''''[[Hypothyroidism]]''''' and positive antithyroid antibodies (anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) and/or anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) antibodies).
* De Quervain's subacute thyroiditis'': painful, very firm, often irregular goitre of abrupt onset with biological signs of inflammation (increase in C-reactive protein) and initially transient hyperthyroidism. This diagnosis is much rarer than the previous 2.
