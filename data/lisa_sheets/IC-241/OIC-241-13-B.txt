[[File:Fig PEC goitres nodules thyroïdiens.jpg|vignette|433x433px|Prise en charge des goitres et nodules thyroïdiens en fonction des situations cliniques]]
The possibilities for managing the goitre and nodules are discussed with the patient in order to propose an appropriate course of action according to his or her case.<ref>Polycopy of the Collège des Enseignants d'Endocrinologie, Diabète et Maladies Métaboliques (4th edition, 2019)</ref>


'''1. goitre:'''

- Monitoring may be proposed for euthyroid multinodular goitres with no compressive effect and no suspicion of malignancy.

- Radical treatment is discussed if clinical signs are present (neck discomfort), if the patient is progressing towards hyperthyroidism, or if there is a suspicious nodule or endothoracic goitre.

- The administration of a therapeutic dose of 131 iodine may be proposed in cases of hyperthyroidism, in elderly patients or in patients in poor general condition.


'''2. Hyperfunctional thyroid nodules'' responsible for hyperthyroidism:

- surgery (lobectomy)

- treatment with radioactive iodine (iodine 131) - in elderly or frail patients [[Hyperthyroidism]].


'''3. Non-functioning thyroid nodules:''''

- clinical and ultrasound monitoring in the case of benign nodules

- surgical treatment is proposed in the following situations:

*benign nodule is large (> 40 mm) and causes functional discomfort, or is increasing in size
*suspicious or malignant nodule
*indeterminate nodule (according to the Bethesda cytological classification), management is discussed with the patient on a case-by-case basis depending on the context.
