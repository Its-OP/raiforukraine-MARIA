'''Epidemiology'''

- HHV6 virus (Herpesviridae family, beta-herpesvirinae subfamily, roseolovirus genus)

- human-to-human transmission via the respiratory route (saliva, droplets)

- primary infection in early childhood, then lifelong latency, with potentially severe reactivation in immunocompromised patients (Herpes virus)


Clinical characteristics (primary infection)

'''-'''' incubation 5 to 15 days

often asymptomatic

- symptomatic form (roseola): 2 phases

           - pre-eruptive (invasion): high fever with general signs lasting 1 to 6 days (average 3 days)

           - eruptive: ''maculopapular exanthema'', pink ''pale'', face and trunk, ''fleeting'', 24 hours. Fever disappears with the rash (diagnostic argument).


Treatment is symptomatic

Complications are rare (neurological)
