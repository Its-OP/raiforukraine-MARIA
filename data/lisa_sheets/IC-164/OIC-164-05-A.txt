'''Epidemiology:''''

- the rubella virus is an RNA virus, belonging to the Togaviridae family and the Rubivirus genus

- human-to-human transmission via the respiratory (or transplacental) route

- most often benign infection (50% asymptomatic) but potentially severe during pregnancy (<18SA) because of the risk of foetopathy


'''Prevention:'''

- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination (see vaccination): compulsory for under-2s (two doses: 12 months then 16-18 months), catch-up if not immune or incomplete vaccination, particularly for women of childbearing age outside pregnancy (see vaccination).

- '''mandatory declaration'''

- no eviction from the community

- avoid contact with non-immune pregnant women


Clinical features

'''-'''' incubation 15-20 days

- contagiousness: 7 days before 14 days after rash

- 2 phases

           - pre-eruptive (invasion): fever and aspecific general signs

           - eruptive: maculopapular exanthema with patches of healthy skin, paler than the measles rash, following the same kinetics (head to toe), fleeting, disappearing in 3 days. It is accompanied by moderate fever and inconstant lymphadenopathy, particularly in the retroauricular and posterior cervical regions.

Complications are rare and include thrombocytopenia, joint damage (rare in children) and, more rarely, neurological damage.

Treatment is symptomatic


'''Risk during pregnancy/Fetopathy/Congenital rubella''''

Transplacental passage of the virus during the "first months of pregnancy (before 18 weeks' gestation)" is responsible for a risk of death in utero or congenital malformations that is all the higher the earlier the pregnancy (70% to 100% risk if primary infection before 11 weeks' gestation, up to 80% between 12 and 18 weeks' gestation).

Viremia during embryogenesis can cause damage to the central nervous system and/or the inner ear and/or the eye and/or the cardiovascular system.

Congenital rubella can therefore result in growth retardation, sensory damage (deafness, eye damage), neurological damage (developmental delay, microcephaly) or even cardiac malformations (examination of the newborn at term SD-039).
