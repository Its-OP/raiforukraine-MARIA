Epidemiology/Physiopathology

- vasculitis of the medium-sized vessels, the precise pathophysiology of which is still unknown: combination of immune and environmental factors (including infection) in a genetically predisposed background.

- For "young children" (< 5 years)

- More frequent in certain populations (Asia), severe forms of "Kawasaki Shock" more frequent in Afro-Caribbeans

- Recently (April 2020): description of a "Kawasaki-like" syndrome called Pediatric Multi-Systemic Inflammation Syndrome (PIMS) following infection with SARS-COv2, which differs from Kawasaki by a greater frequency of myocardial damage in particular.


Clinical features

The diagnosis is based on a number of factors


'''Complete classical form:'''

'''-'''' combines '''a fever lasting 5 days or more ([[Prolonged fever]], [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044]]) and 4 of the following criteria (major criteria)''',

           - ''maculopapular exanthema or diffuse erythema'' of the trunk and limbs with early fine desquamation at D5

           -involvement of the extremities with erythema of the palms and soles and/or oedema of the hands and feet and/or subacute fine desquamation (later, around D10)

           - bilateral non-suppurative bulbar conjunctivitis

           - oropharyngeal involvement: glossitis and/or cheilitis and/or pharyngitis

           - cervical ''adenopathies'' > 1.5cm bilateral but with the possibility of unilateral (or asymmetric) localisation which can sometimes lead to the diagnosis of a phlegmon, so think of it when faced with an atypical evolution of a cervical or even parapharyngeal ''adenophlegmon'' without bacterial documentation.

! The major criteria are not all contemporary, so it is important to look for them during the history-taking interview.

! A high level of irritability is almost constant in infants and young children.

Other organ disorders may be associated (systemic vasculitis): cardiac (myocarditis, pericarditis), hepatobiliary (hepatitis, hydrocholecyst), neurological (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis), pulmonary, ocular (uveitis) or digestive.


'''Incomplete form'''

There are incomplete forms (fewer than 4 major criteria), which can lead to misdiagnosis, particularly in younger children, and thus expose them to a greater risk of cardiac complications.

In the presence of unexplained fever lasting more than 5 days, with a patient in poor general condition, it is therefore important to be able to investigate this diagnosis (in addition to the infectious work-up) by means of a biological work-up and cardiac ultrasound.

A normal cardiac ultrasound scan does not rule out the diagnosis, but in the case of coronary dilatation, the diagnosis may be accepted even if there are fewer than 4 other major criteria other than fever.


'''Biological abnormalities'''

The following anomalies are often observed:

- inflammatory syndrome: high CRP and SV, hyperleukocytosis, thrombocytosis (appearing later (D10) than the other parameters), hypoalbuminemia

- liver abnormality: moderate cytolysis (frequent), more rarely elevated bilirubin

- very frequent aseptic leucocyturia

- Aseptic meningitis (when LP is performed)


'''Complications'''

- acute: multisystemic form "Kawasaki shock" with myocarditis, multivisceral damage, macrophagic activation syndrome


- sub-acute: ''dilatation of the coronary arteries'' which may lead to aneurysm. The risk of dilatation is increased after 10 days without treatment, so the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is urgent.

Diagnosis is made using a transthoracic ''cardiac ultrasound'' by a cardiologist with experience of this disease.


'''Care/Orientation'''

Suspicion of Kawasaki disease warrants a hospital assessment

Once the diagnosis has been made, treatment is always "hospital-based" and involves an infusion of intravenous polyvalent immunoglobulin and aspirin in anti-inflammatory and then anti-aggregating doses for a total period of 6 to 8 weeks.

Cardiological monitoring with ultrasound must be put in place
