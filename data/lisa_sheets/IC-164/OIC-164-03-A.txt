[Rashes in children SD-037

The guide "Eruptive diseases, purpura and dermatitis in children<ref>[http://www.urgencehsj.ca/wp-content/uploads/EruptionsPurpuras.pdf Eruptive diseases, purpura and dermatitis in children], http://www.urgencehsj.ca/wp-content/uploads/EruptionsPurpuras.pdf</ref>" by Dr Girodias, a paediatrician at Sainte Justine Hospital in Montreal, is an interesting resource to help you remember the aetiologies of febrile eruptions (identified in red on the 2nd slide) with their epidemiological and clinical characteristics.


'''1/ LOOK FOR AN EMERGENCY'' ([[Febrile exanthemata in children: assessment of severity 2C-164-IU-A01]])

           Haemodynamic failure: purpura fulminans, necrotizing fasciitis, toxic shock syndrome

           Mucosal ulcerations +/- epidermal detachments: Stevens Johnson syndrome, Lyell, erythema multiforme major, epidermolysis

           Erythema, oedema of the face, adenopathy, general deterioration, multivisceral involvement (+ hypereosinophilia): DRESS

           Fever ≥ 5 days + cervical adenopathy + mucosal involvement (conjunctivitis, glossitis) + pharyngitis + oedema extremities: Kawasaki (more or less complete picture)

           Warm, painful infiltrated localised erythema: bacterial dermo-hypodermatitis, necrotising fasciitis


'''2/ Characterise the rash''' (cf Febrile exanthemata in children: type of rash)

Type of elementary lesion, but also chronology of appearance in relation to fever, location and evolution of lesions

            Macular exanthema without an interval of healthy skin (scarlatinifoma): scarlet fever, staphylococcal toxic shock, staphylococcal epidermolysis

           Maculopapular exanthema (morbilliform): measles, rubella, Parvovirus B19, roseola (HHV6), enterovirus/paraechovirus, Gianotti Crosti (infantile papular acrodermatitis), laterothoracic exanthema, NIDs

           Vesiculo-pustular exanthema: chickenpox, herpes (primary infection with stomatitis, otherwise non-febrile), coxsackie (Hand Foot Mouth Syndrome)

           Aspecific exanthema: viral, systemic disease


'''3/ Search for associated anamnestic elements'''

           History: immunosuppression, co-morbidities

           Contage (community), vaccinations

           Medication taken (precise date in relation to onset of signs)


'''4/ Search for associated clinical features'''

           Respiratory signs: measles, aspecific virosis

           Angina: scarlet fever, NID

          



          

5/ Diagnostic confirmation

Some diagnoses are clinically based and do not require further investigation in the absence of a risk situation (e.g. chickenpox, epidemic megalerythema, sudden exanthema), others, such as Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, are based on a combination of clinical and biological evidence, while others (NID, measles) are based on microbiology (PCR saliva and/or blood (depending on the virus) or serology with IgM detection).
