An exanthema is an acute, transient skin rash.

The classification of an exanthema is based on the characterisation of the elementary lesion: macule, papule, vesicle, pustule. A distinction is made between vesiculo-pustular exanthemas (chickenpox, for example) and erythematous exanthemas (redness due to cutaneous vasodilation). (see sheet 114)

There are two clinical types of erythematous exanthema:

- macular exanthemas with no interval of healthy skin (also known as scarlatiniform exanthemas) as in scarlet fever

- maculopapular exanthems with patches of healthy skin (also known as morbilliform exanthems), as in measles.
