'''Epidemiology:''''

- the measles virus is an RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family and the Morbillivirus genus

- human-to-human transmission by air (aerosol) ''highly contagious'' (R<sub>0</sub>= 15 to 20, which means that one infected person can be responsible for 15 to 20 secondary cases)

- ''major cause of infant mortality in the world'' (death rare in high-income countries)

- '''regular outbreaks of epidemics in France'' (cf public health)


'''Prevention:'''

- Vaccine prevention through MMR vaccination: compulsory for under-2s (12 and 16-18 months), then catch-up vaccination if not immune or incomplete in subjects born after 1980 (2 doses) (see vaccination).

- around a case (see below)

- community eviction: 5 days after the start of the rash

- '''mandatory declaration'''


Clinical features

- incubation 10-12 days

- Contagiousness: 5 days before to 5 days after the rash (important ++ for case investigation)

- in 2 phases

o invasion (preceding eruption by 2 to 4 days): fever, oculorespiratory ''catarrh'' (''TOUX++''), ''Koplik'' (inconstant)

o eruptive (5-6 days): ''maculopapular'' rash with ''interval of healthy skin'', spreading from ''top to bottom'' (starts behind ear then face then rest of body)

'''Complications'''

Linked to the virus

           - viral ''pneumonia

           - '''early acute encephalitis'''

           - late-onset encephalitis (up to 10 years after measles) = Van Bogaert's subacute sclerosing panencephalitis


Linked to bacterial superinfection (!!! persistence or recurrence of fever)

           - acute otitis media

           - bacterial pneumonia


'''!!! : Increased risk of complications before 1 year'''


'''Signs of seriousness'''

linked to infection

- respiratory (respiratory distress due to lung damage)

- neurological (consciousness disorders, convulsions, linked to encephalitis)

related to the impact (risk of dehydration in infants)


'''Treatment'''

Symptomatic

Antibiotics if bacterial superinfection


'''CAT around a case'''

           Adults: check status: disease or vaccine, vaccination within 3 days if not immune or incomplete vaccination according to recommendations (2 doses if born after 1980 or if healthcare or early childhood staff regardless of date of birth) (see vaccination).

           Pregnant woman or immunosuppressed: contraindication to vaccination, IV polyvalent immunoglobulin (200 mg/kg) if non-immune, emergency serology if in doubt.

           Child

                      - < 6 months :

                                  if mother is immune: nothing (baby protected by maternal antibodies, so no vaccine or IVIG)

                                  if mother not immune: IVIG within 6 days of contact (then 9 months before starting vaccination)

                      - from 6 to 11 months :

                                  if seen within 3 days: vaccination (but this does not count in the calendar, so repeat doses according to the calendar at 12 and 16-18 months)

                                  if seen after 3 days and before 6 days: IVIG (followed by a 9-month delay before starting vaccination)

                      - 12 months and over: update of vaccination schedule according to recommendations ([[Vaccinations]])
