Fat intake should be reduced to allow for an increase in carbohydrate intake. Total fat intake should not be less than 20% of total energy intake (TEI).


'''Protein intake''' is essential for maintaining muscle mass

They are covered by the increase in total energy intake and depend on the type and level of physical activity:

|Moderate PA (3 times 30 to 60 min/week)
|Nutritional reference for the population 0.83 g/kg/day
|-
|Endurance sports
|1.2-1.4 g/kg/day (12-14% AET),

covered by â†‘ of total energy intake
|-
|Maintenance of muscle mass
|1.3-1.5 g/kg/day
|-
|Increase in muscle mass
|Up to 2.5 g/kg/day (max. 6 months)

Protein supplements: maximum 1/3 of intake

not to exceed 1 g/kg/day
