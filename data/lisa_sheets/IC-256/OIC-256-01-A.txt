A medical certificate stating that you have no contraindications to practising sport is required:

- To obtain or renew a federal sports licence

- To take part in a sports competition if the patient is not a member of a sports federation


This medical certificate must be less than one year old on the day of application for the federal licence or registration for the competition.


Any medical doctor can draw up this certificate, which states that there are no contraindications to practising the sport, in competition where applicable, and mentions the contraindicated discipline(s) where appropriate.


If a sports patient renews their licence with the same federation from one year to the next, the medical certificate is only required every three years. During the two intervening years, the athlete can obtain a licence by certifying to his or her federation that he or she has answered NO to each of the sections of the "QS-SPORT" health questionnaire available [https://www.formulaires.service-public.fr/gf/cerfa_15699.do '''ici'''].


Certain sports involving special constraints (mountaineering, underwater diving, speleology, combat sports with knockouts, sports using firearms, sports using motor vehicles, sports using aircraft, rugby with 15, 13 or 7 players) require specific medical examinations (cardiological, ENT, dental, neurological, ophthalmological, cervical spine, etc.).


Since 2021, underage athletes no longer need to produce a medical certificate if the athlete and the persons with parental authority certify to the sports federation that they have answered NO to each section of the health questionnaire available [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf?id=yHZEBHkn_kaTM1bXfxTCPGyRsOnBUcIeGNWwTr_70OE= '''ici'''].
