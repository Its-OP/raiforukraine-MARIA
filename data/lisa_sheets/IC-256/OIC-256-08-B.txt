Carbohydrates are the main substrate for high-intensity physical activity.

Lipids are the substrate for moderate and prolonged physical activity.


For the majority of sportspeople, the recommended nutritional intake is that of the general population.


For more than 3 hours of sporting activity per week, nutritional intake should be adapted by increasing energy intake to cover total energy expenditure (TEE).
