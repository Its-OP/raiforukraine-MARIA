Physical and sports education (PSE) is compulsory. In the absence of a specific certificate of inaptitude, all children and adolescents are considered fit for PSE.

Partial or total, temporary or permanent contraindications (inaptitude) to practising sport in the school environment are linked to either

- chronic illnesses in decompensation, permanent disabilities preventing certain activities or situations of severe malnutrition (anorexia nervosa)

- acute illnesses that contraindicate effort or the use of a limb (fracture while it heals)

A medical certificate is required for full or partial exemption. They are valid for no longer than the current school year. Total or permanent disqualifications are exceptional.<ref>Medical supervision of disqualifications from physical education and sport in educational establishments[https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/download/pdf/circ?id=43765]</ref>
