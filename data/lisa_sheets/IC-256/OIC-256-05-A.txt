Sudden death during exercise is in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular origin.

The causes of contraindications to sporting activities are essentially cardiovascular:

* Cardiac pathologies causing rhythm disorders: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic dysplasia of the right ventricle, birth defects of the coronary arteries, Brugada syndrome, long QT, short QT, etc.

* Progressive or unbalanced cardiovascular pathologies: unstable coronary artery disease, unstable heart failure, unbalanced hypertension, myocarditis, etc.


In addition to cardiovascular causes, there are certain unbalanced or severe pathologies:

* Loss of consciousness not investigated

* Evolving or ongoing respiratory diseases

* Morbid lack of weight and height

* Severe morphological disorders

* Serious neurological pathologies


There are also contraindications specific to certain sports (non-exhaustive list):

* Contact sports: loss of a paired organ (eye, kidney, gonad, etc.) to prevent loss of the second organ during practice.

* Collision or contact sports: haemophilia, anticoagulant treatment

* Boxing: myopia (increased risk of retinal detachment)

* Underwater diving: asthma, history of pneumothorax, ENT pathologies
