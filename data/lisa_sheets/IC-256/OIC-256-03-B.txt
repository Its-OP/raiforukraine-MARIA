The consultation for the issue of a medical certificate stating that there are no contraindications to practising sport must include :

- An interview to clarify :

*Personal and family history, in particular cardiovascular risk factors ([[Major, independent, modifiable risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia) and non-modifiable risk factors (age, male sex, heredity) 2C-222-DE-A02|Cf item 222]]).
*Medicinal treatments and any use of food supplements, ensuring that these are not prohibited by anti-doping regulations ([[Doping and doping behaviour (see item 256)|Cf item 80]])
*Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular pathology during exercise ([[Search for risk factors and symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular pathology during questioning 2C-256-PC-A02|Cf objective 11]])
*Sporting conditions (sporting past, number of hours per week of practice, level of competition)

- Anthropometric measurements: height, body mass, BMI

- A general physical examination and paraclinical examinations including in particular:

*A cardiovascular examination:
**Physical examination: auscultation, palpation of distal pulses, search for a vascular murmur.
**measurement of blood pressure in both arms
**Resting ECG.

The recommendations of the French Society of Cardiology for young subjects are to carry out an ECG at the first licence from the age of 12, then every 3 years between the ages of 12 and 20, then every 5 years between the ages of 20 and 35.

After the age of 35, the risk of coronary heart disease increases and an ECG should be performed every 1 to 2 years.

*A pulmonary auscultation

*An examination of the musculoskeletal system, based on any functional complaints the patient may have and the segments that are particularly stressed by their sporting activities (spine, lower limbs, upper limbs).

*Visual acuity screening


Finally, it's important to remember that for many young patients with no chronic illnesses, this is sometimes their only annual medical appointment. So it's important to take advantage of the opportunity to carry out preventive procedures, such as updating vaccinations and raising awareness of healthy lifestyle habits (diet, sleep, dental check-ups, gynaecological check-ups, etc.).
