As in adults, sport in children presents macrotraumatic risks (fractures, wounds, etc.) which are not specific to sport.


But intensive sport can also cause microtrauma, or "overuse" pathologies, linked to the repetition of sporting activities. This is the case for adults (tendinopathies, fatigue fractures, etc.) and children.

The main pathologies in children appear during growth peaks, at a time when the conjugation cartilages are particularly active. This pain around the growth plate is known as osteochondrosis, and is due to disturbances in ossification and is linked to the mechanical factors generated by sporting movements: tendon traction on the apophyseal cores, impact on the growth plate, shearing of the epiphyseal growth plates. The pubertal growth spurt, during which body mass and biomechanical leverage increase, is particularly at risk.


The two most frequent locations are :

- The posterior apophysis of the calcaneus (heel): Sever's disease.

Appears most frequently around the age of 9-10.

- The apophyseal nucleus of the anterior tibial tuberosity (knee): Osgood-Schlatter disease.

A common pathology in team sports (football, etc.), tennis, gymnastics, etc., most frequently appearing around the age of 13 in boys and 11 in girls.


These pathologies are diagnosed clinically, with the examination revealing mechanical pain localised in the growth plate. X-rays may be used to complete the assessment.

Treatment consists of a period of sports rest. Only the most severe cases require immobilisation and offloading.

Homolateral or contralateral recurrences are frequent.
