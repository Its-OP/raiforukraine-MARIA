'''Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with or resembling that associated with actual or potential tissue damage"'' (official definition from the International Association for the Study of Pain).

The ability to experience pain is an innate faculty, inherent to life, from the moment of even very premature birth: behavioural signs are the equivalent of verbal communication throughout early childhood, and at any age in the case of cognitive impairment.

The younger the child, the more the cause and consequences escape them, the more their cognitive defence mechanisms against pain are immature or defective, the more the pain invades them and generates intense distress. Fear and pain are always associated in children. The presence of parents is an essential factor in providing relief and a feeling of security.

As in adults, there are four components of pain:

- sensory-discriminative: poorly communicated by children due to lack of vocabulary;

- cognitive: not very accessible to children who do not understand what is going on;

- affective-emotional: evident in children who do not mask their feelings (fear, anger, sadness);

- behaviour: the child's preferred means of expression

Memory and psychological context have a major influence on the way pain is felt and expressed.

There are three types of pain mechanism:

* '''''pain due to excess nociception: tissue damage (''trauma, burns, inflammation, etc.)
* ''''' neuropathic pain''''' by neurological lesion (central or peripheral) affecting the perception system (somatosensory): compression, inflammation, phantom limb, etc.
* '''''unexplained pain''''' or functional pain, or psychosomatic pain: no cause is identified, but the pain is felt in the body (e.g. recurrent abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, chronic tension headache, etc.): this is neither simulation nor manipulation, but the expression of difficulties in life (somatisation).
