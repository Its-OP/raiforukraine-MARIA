The components of pain require responses that take into account sensory, physical, cognitive and emotional aspects.

Pain caused by an illness, trauma or post-operation requires medical treatment, always combined with non-medical treatment (at least relational support and distraction).

Medically unexplained chronic pain (abdominal, musculoskeletal, etc.) is mainly treated using non-medicinal, mind-body methods.

Physical methods: adapted physical activity, physiotherapy, massage, electrostimulation (TENS), the application of cold, heat and vibration are often indicated, especially in traumatology, post-operation, rheumatology, and for prolonged or chronic pain.

Mind-body methods'': music, distraction of attention by various means, virtual reality, relaxation and hypnoanalgesia are frequently used to reduce pain and anxiety in children, with effectiveness documented by numerous studies, particularly for pain induced by care. Mind-body methods and psychotherapies are recommended for chronic pain.

The quality of paediatric analgesia is linked to the multimodal aspect of the interventions offered to a child in pain. Caring for and relieving pain as much as possible are an integral part of the treatment of the illness, in order to avoid harmful distress for the child, in an ethical approach centred on the child's welfare.
