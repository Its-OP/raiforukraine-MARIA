Pain assessment allows pain to be confirmed and its intensity to be measured. The aim is to understand as closely as possible what the child is experiencing: this involves a warm, empathetic relationship, followed by a scientifically validated measurement tool that enables appropriate prescriptions to be made and treatment to be monitored.

Assess when the painful area is calm and mobilised, then regularly, always using the same scale.

- From 0 to 4 years, and in the event of communication difficulties, use a behavioural observation scale (hetero-evaluation), chosen according to age and situation. The most widely used scale, which can be used in most contexts, is EVENDOL. Other scales are more specific to newborns, the post-operative period, disability situations, pain in healthcare, etc.

- Between the ages of 4 and 6, try self-assessment using the face scale, and confirm with hetero-assessment if necessary.

- From the age of 6, children can generally assess themselves (self-assessment), using the FPS face scale, then a vertical VAS as they get older, followed by the 0-10 numerical scale from the age of 8-10.

Describe the upper terminal soberly as "very, very bad pain".)

Chronic pain requires an overall bio-psycho-social assessment. The context of life and the impact on daily life (activities, school, social life) must be assessedÃÅ, as well as the anxiety-depressive aspects.
