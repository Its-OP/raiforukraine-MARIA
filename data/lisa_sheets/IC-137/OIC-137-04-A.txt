The quality of the empathic relationship, the welcome, the information given to the child and his family, the comfortable setting and the presence of the parents are essential.

- The aim of the treatment is to achieve rapid and lasting pain relief.

- Always combine validated non-pharmacological methods (with proven effectiveness): distraction, settling in, parents' presence, relaxation, hypnosis, information, dialogue.

- Prescribe analgesics systematically, for the foreseeable duration of the pain, and not "if pain, or if need be".

- Adapt to the intensity of the pain: for intense pain, level 2 or 3 morphine immediately (except for migraine attacks, certain neuropathic pain and psychogenic pain of the somatisation type).

- Combine analgesics as soon as necessary: paracetamol and NSAIDs and morphine.

- Oral or IV routes are preferable; suppositories are no longer recommended (random absorption, except for IV drugs administered as IR), and SC and IM injections should be avoided.

- Include a prescription for recourse in the event of insufficient relief, e.g. :

Paracetamol/6 h systematically; if EVENDOL > 5/15, add ...

- Reassess after administration of an analgesic, taking into account the time taken for the analgesic to become effective, depending on the route of administration: intravenous: 5 min if bolus, 15 min if IVL; oral: 30 to 60 min ;

- Specific treatments are indicated for neuropathic pain.

- Beware of situations of unexplained chronic pain: avoid morphine, and plan for comprehensive treatment (often with the advice of a psychologist or child psychiatrist);

- Never use a placebo (except in clinical trials); efficacy cannot be used to distinguish between "organic" and "functional" pain.

* Specific recommendations can be found in the HAS 2016 recommendations and on the Pédiadol website.
