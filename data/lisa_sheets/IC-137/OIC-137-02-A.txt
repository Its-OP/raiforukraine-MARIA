* Acute pain is easy to recognise (crying, screaming, agitation), but is often confused with fear. Establishing a non-anxiety-provoking relationship by speaking calmly and offering a toy to a child in his parents' arms helps to distinguish between the two; protective gestures, analgesic positions, tensing, facial grimacing when not crying and refusal to play or communicate allow the diagnosis to be made.

* The child stops crying and becomes "too" calm, silent, immobile, seemingly asleep, no longer playing, no longer communicating, distant, inexpressive. Before mentioning sadness, tiredness or shyness, think about pain; bodily signs (abnormal postures, stiffness, tension) and the context help with the diagnosis, which is facilitated by assessment scales.

* ''Chronic pain'' lasts for more than 3 months, or persists beyond the expected duration in relation to an initial event; psychosocial factors play a major role in its genesis or maintenance. Common in adolescents, and often medically unexplained, it has an impact on everyday life.
