The pain associated with care is experienced by small children as an incomprehensible aggression, resulting in distress and protests that quickly become major, even for care that is commonplace for adults (vaccination, blood test). Most treatments cause pain and fear, and a phobia of care can quickly develop.

The prevention of pain and fear must be systematic, from the 1st treatment, in collaboration with the parents, always using non-pharmacological methods, and often pharmacological means.

'''Before the treatment'''

Establishing a relationship of trust in a calm, fun environment, reassuring people

Inform and prepare the child for the treatment: without lying or trivialising, explain the treatment, how it will be carried out, the means used to make it comfortable and the role of each person (see the explanatory sheets from the Sparadrap association, for example).

Avoid negative phrases such as "don't be afraid, don't worry" or false promises such as "it won't hurt".

Use positive phrases such as "don't worry" or "everything will work out for the best".

Allow the child to participate if he or she so wishes

Plan for the presence and role of parents (maintain visual, verbal and tactile contact with their child, help to distract them)

Anticipating painkillers and their onset of action

'''During the treatment'''

Make the parent, child and carer comfortable, get the child to breathe calmly

Entertainment: soap bubbles, toys with sound or light, stories read, dialogue, songs, music, video, video games, virtual reality, etc.

Or accompanied by hypno-analgesia from 5 to 6 years of age, by a trained carer

Know when to stop if the treatment is not going well, and always avoid heavy restraint.

'''After the treatment'''

Praise and reward courage (even if the child has cried).

Assessing pain

'''Main drugs used'''

- MEOPA, an equimolar mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide (50/50), an anxiolytic and analgesic gas

- Anaesthetic cream or patch (EMLA®), to be applied 1 to 2 hours before the skin is broken open.

- Sweetened solution: a few drops on the tip of the tongue for newborns up to 6 months, or breast-feeding.

- Depending on the intensity of the pain expected during treatment, morphine analgesics may be used.

- In the event of ineffectiveness or significant anxiety, sedation with medication is recommended in the care setting, with particular attention paid to the risk of respiratory depression.

The important thing is to avoid a negative memory that will have an impact on subsequent treatments.
