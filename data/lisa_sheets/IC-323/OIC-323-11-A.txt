'''Levels of evidence according to clinical trial schemes (Haute Autorité de santé classification)'''

The French National Authority for Health (HAS) proposes a gradation of recommendations based on the level of scientific evidence in the literature, itself assessed according to the schema of clinical studies:
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Grade des recommandations''''
|'''Level of scientific evidence provided by the literature'''
|-
|'''A Scientific evidence established'''
|'''Level 1'''
*high-powered randomised controlled trials
*meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials
*decision analysis based on well-conducted studies
|-
|'''B Scientific presumption''''
|Level 2
*randomised controlled trials of low power
*well-conducted non-randomised comparative studies
*cohort studies
|-
| rowspan="2" |'''C Low level of scientific evidence'''
|'''Level 3'''
*case-control studies.
|-
|'''Level 4'''
*comparative studies with significant bias
*retrospective studies
*case series
*descriptive epidemiological studies (cross-sectional, longitudinal)
|}


'''Analysis of levels of evidence'''

- Randomisation allows the initial comparability of the different groups. It is necessary to establish a causal relationship.

- Maintaining comparability between groups during prospective follow-up of patients included in a randomised trial: standardisation of measurements, double-blinding, intention-to-treat analysis.

- Taking account of the disease: pathophysiological mechanisms, natural course.

- Pharmaco-therapeutic analysis :

*Mechanism of action of drugs, fate of the drug in the body (pharmacokinetics).
*Clinical efficacy, adverse effects, benefit-risk ratio.
*Place in therapeutic strategy.

- Good clinical practice and patient safety.

- Funders, links of interest.
