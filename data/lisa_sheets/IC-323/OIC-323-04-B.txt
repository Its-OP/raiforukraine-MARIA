Pharmaco-epidemiology

- Post-marketing epidemiological evaluation generally carried out on large samples ("phase IV" in drug evaluation).

- Effectiveness, risk and use of medicines under real conditions of use.

'''Rationale: Limitations of clinical trials'''

- Small sample size (unable to detect rare events)

- Characteristics not well represented in the patients included (e.g. elderly)

- Generalisation (population included sometimes different from the population actually receiving the treatment in a real prescription situation)

- The question posed is highly specific.

- No assessment of long-term efficacy and risks.

Indications for pharmaco-epidemiology studies

- Assessing the effectiveness of medicines

*Re-evaluation of efficacy measured in clinical trials under real conditions of use.
*Identification of the determinants of differing efficacy: responders / non-responders.
*Assessment of long-term efficacy (exhaustion of effect).
*Comparison of several therapeutic strategies not compared in clinical trials.

- Assessment of undesirable effects

*Reassessment of the existence of a risk.
*Detection of adverse effects: unknown effects, long-term effects.
*Determinants of adverse reactions: susceptible subjects (e.g. co-morbidities), treatment methods (e.g. misuse, drug interactions).

- Evaluation of drug use

*Identifies the methods and determinants of prescribing and use.
*Documents the correct use of medicines.

'''Methodology of pharmaco-epidemiology studies:'''

- Essentially observational approach

- Study design: descriptive cross-sectional studies, cohort surveys, case-control studies

- The exposure studied is always the drug

- Interpretation: Beware of indication bias: a special case of confounding bias when the drug studied is prescribed for a particular indication which is associated with the occurrence of the event of interest (endpoint).
