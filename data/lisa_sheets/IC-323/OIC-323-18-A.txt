'''Clinical relevance:''' Is the outcome of the study clinically relevant? Will the results be of benefit to the target population if they are taken into account or applied in clinical practice?

'''Consequences''':

*in clinical practice: results justifying a change in practice
*in public health: for example, a change in healthcare provision

Clinical relevance analysis

- Objective: relevance of the question asked

- Methods :

*The sample of subjects included in the study must be representative of the target population, so that the results can be extrapolated (notion of external validity).
*Judgement criteria relevant to the clinical objective: clinical criteria (survival, morbi-mortality) should be preferred to surrogate criteria (paraclinical parameters).
*Choice of comparator in an experimental study (a placebo-controlled trial when there is a reference treatment will compromise clinical relevance).
*Relevant duration of follow-up

- Results :

*The effect measured is sufficiently large (effect size) and estimated with sufficient precision to be of interest in current clinical practice.
*A statistically significant difference with the comparator does not necessarily imply clinical relevance.
*Severity and frequency of adverse effects of the intervention in an experimental study (a highly effective treatment with frequent and/or severe adverse effects may be considered clinically irrelevant).
