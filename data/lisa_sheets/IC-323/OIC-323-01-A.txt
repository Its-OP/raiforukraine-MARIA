'''Evidence-based medicine''' '''= MÃ©decine factuelle (EBM, Evidence Based Medicine).''''

<u>Definition</u>:" '"Demonstrative evidence-based medicine is the rigorous, explicit and judicious use of the most relevant current evidence when making decisions about each patient's care"' (Sackett ''et al''. BMJ, 1996)

<EBM approach</u>: faced with a clinical problem concerning a given patient

#Formulate the medical problem into a clear and precise question
#Search the literature for the most relevant articles in relation to the question posed.
#Evaluate the reliability, applicability and clinical relevance of the conclusions drawn from the articles selected.
#Use the results to answer the initial question posed.

<u>Finality</u>: Making clinical decisions that must integrate 3 components.

*The practitioner's clinical experience
*the best current clinical research data
*Patient preferences

'''Therapeutic evaluation'''

- Involves a drug or non-drug therapy (gene therapies, medical devices, surgery, radiotherapy, psychotherapy, etc.).

- Determines whether its use improves the state of health of patients, whether it leads to adverse events, its cost, the benefit/risk ratio, the cost-effectiveness ratio, etc.

- Takes into account the level of evidence and clinical relevance of the study.

- Methods: all study designs (clinical trials, meta-analysis, cohort, case-control, case series, etc.) may be used, but the level of evidence will not be equivalent depending on the design chosen.
