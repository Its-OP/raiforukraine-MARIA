'''Level of evidence'''

- = Ability of a study to answer the question posed.

- 3 elements:

*Appropriateness of the protocol to the question asked
*Existence of bias
*Power of the study

- Does not depend on the outcome of the study

*The same level of evidence for a negative study as for a positive study if these studies are well conducted.
