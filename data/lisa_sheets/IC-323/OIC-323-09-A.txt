'''Expertise'''

- Expert: Individual called upon by an agency, government body or pharmaceutical company to provide advice and opinions.

- Public expertise (HAS, ANSM, Directorate-General for Health, European Medicines Agency, etc.) or from a company (pharmaceutical laboratory, etc.).

- Principle: It is impossible to be both judge and party when assessing treatment.

'''Link of interest'''

- Of all kinds: material, financial, moral, etc.

- Directly or through an intermediary.

- Past (often the last 5 years), present or even future.

'''Declaration of all links of interest'''

- Expert reports: since 2013, there has been a legal obligation in France to publish the links between healthcare product companies and healthcare professionals.

- Other situations: scientific publications (at the end of the article), scientific presentations (conferences, meetings) and, ideally, media appearances.

'''Conflict of interest'''

- The independence of the professional is called into question.

- Assumes the existence of a link of interest, in a situation where the benefit received by the doctor has an impact on his independence.

- Not systematic in the case of a link of interest (a link of interest has an objective definition but its extent and scope may or may not give rise to a conflict of interest, the definition of which is more subjective and contextual).

- Example: taking part in the public evaluation of a treatment that you have helped to develop.

- Prevention by examining declared links of interest, then recusal from the assessment if a link or even a conflict of interest is detected in relation to the expertise.

'''Assessment of the potential impact on medical information (critical reading of articles)''''

Criteria to look for :

*Consistency of the research protocol with the results presented.
*Compliance with good clinical practice.
*Independence between investigators/researchers/authors and:
**the industry concerned (pharmaceutical, agri-food, etc.)
**the editorial board of the scientific journal
*Independence between the scientific journal and the industry concerned
*Statistical analysis of results independent of the sponsor.
*Declaration of any links of interest between authors.

'''Aspects under discussion'''

- Duration of links of interest.

- Extent of links of interest :

*Is the expert disqualified for all medicines from a given laboratory?
*Expert disqualified for all drugs proposed for the same therapeutic indication?

- Level of expertise of a doctor who has never taken part in a clinical trial?

- Difficulties for certain diseases (e.g. orphan diseases) in identifying experts with no links of interest<br />.
