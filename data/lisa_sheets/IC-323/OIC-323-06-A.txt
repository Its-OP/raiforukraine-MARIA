Placebo and clinical research

- Comparative clinical trial, particularly phase 3.

*Comparator of the experimental treatment studied: reference treatment or placebo allowing the study to be carried out in a blinded fashion.
*Objective: the difference in health status between the groups is attributable to the specific effect of the treatment under study.
*Need for randomisation to ensure initial comparability between groups, and a double-blind design to maintain comparability throughout the study.

- Conditions for using placebo

*Clinical trial with no reference drug in the indication (a rare situation in practice).
*Clinical trial comparing two active treatments to make them indistinguishable (double placebo).
*Comparative trial evaluating the addition of a new treatment to the reference treatment ("add-on": reference treatment + new treatment vs reference treatment + placebo).

Placebo and clinical practice

- Placebo effect potentially present in all medical procedures.

- Placebo "medicine": No indication these days.

- Certain paramedical practices, such as homeopathy, are based on the placebo effect: they aim to improve certain functional signs in the absence of an active principle, thanks to the context in which the product is prescribed and administered.
