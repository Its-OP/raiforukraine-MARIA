'''Blind definition''' (''"blind"''''')''''

Procedure designed to mask the treatment received by the patient in a randomised controlled trial.

'''Simply blind'''

Only the patient does not know what treatment they are receiving

'''Double blind'''

Neither the patient, nor the doctor or team looking after the patient and collecting the assessment criteria know what treatment the patient has received.

Double placebo

When a randomised trial compares 2 drugs A and B of different appearance or route of administration (e.g. capsule vs. tablet, IV vs. oral), to comply with double-blind, a double placebo must be used (placebo of drug A for patients in group B, and placebo of drug B for patients in group A). The placebo looks identical to the drug but contains no active ingredient.<gallery>

</gallery>'''Open trial''' ''("open-label")'''

*A trial in which there is no blinding.
*Some comparisons cannot be blinded, for example, in a trial comparing surgery with radiotherapy (see [[Knowing the acceptable situations of single blinding 2C-323-DE-B03]]).

'''Essai ouvert avec évaluation en aveugle''' ''("PROBE -'' Prospective, Randomized, Open-label, Blinded Endpoint''")'''

Open-label trial with blinded collection of endpoint(s) for the treatment received by the patient:

*by a blinded third party (e.g. neurological assessment by a carer who neither included nor managed the patient)
*by an adjudication committee which blindly reviews patients' files to determine whether or not they have the event(s) that constitute(s) the assessment criterion (e.g. cardiovascular events)
*by a centralised blind reading of an examination (e.g. radiological images)

'''Interest of the blind'''

*Limits monitoring or performance bias: the team's management of patients and the patient's attitude (including compliance) may be different if they are aware of the treatment received.
*Limits evaluation or measurement bias (subjectivity of the patient and of the evaluator with knowledge of the treatment received by the patient).
