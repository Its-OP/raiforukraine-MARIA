'''Sources of information on the drug:'''

- Scientific literature

- Public database of medicines: summary of product characteristics (SPC), package leaflets.

- Recommendations: official (HAS, ANSM), learned societies (national, international).

- Specialist works: books, dictionaries.

- Press: medical, generalist.

- Pharmaceutical industry, start-ups.

- Advertising.

'''Major economic issues in the production of scientific information for the pharmaceutical industry'''

- Objective: development of new drugs, extension of indications for existing drugs.

- Europe: marketing authorisation obtained.

- France: HAS opinion (medical service rendered, improvement in medical service rendered), reimbursement level.

'''The pharmaceutical industry's strategy for developing new drugs'''

- Medical: Funding of research work (epidemiological, fundamental, clinical), production of articles (review), funding of networks of doctors and learned societies.

- Marketing: Communication with doctors (e.g. medical visits), organisation of meetings (local, regional, national), invitations to conferences.

'''The problem of scientific information from the pharmaceutical industry'''

*Major economic stakes: considerable financial and logistical support for the conduct of numerous clinical trials, the evaluation stage necessary for marketing or extending the indications of their products.
**therefore, by definition, a link of interest
**and often a conflict of interest that casts doubt on the objectivity of the scientific information produced (results and their interpretation).

*Assessment of the impact of the link/conflict of interest on scientific information: see [[Discussing links of interest and the potential impact on medical information 2C-323-PE-A02]].
