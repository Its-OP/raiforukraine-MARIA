'''Benefit/risk ratio'''

- Ratio between efficacy and potential adverse effects.

- Any administration of medication carries the risk of undesirable effects.

- An effective drug can have serious side effects.

- At clinician level :

*Information to be given, elements for discussion with the patient and their family.
*Decision to treat, decision not to treat.
*Monitoring procedures (clinical, biological, imaging).
*Assessment to decide whether to continue or stop treatment.

- At the level of the public health decision-maker :

*Effects on public health.
*Assessment of the acceptable level of risk.
*Contribution to the disease of interest (SMR).
*Comparison with existing drugs and therapeutic tools (ASMR).
*Monitoring under real healthcare conditions.


The benefit/risk ratio evolves and is assessed at every stage in the development and marketing of a medicine:

'''Pharmaco-therapeutic evaluation'''

- Drug development

- Drug registration

*European: MA, Risk Management Plan (RMP).
*National: Mutual recognition, Medical Service Rendered (SMR), Improvement in Medical Service Rendered (ASMR).

- Post-AMM

*Pharmacovigilance: Undesirable effects.
*Addiction vigilance: abuse and dependence.
*Pharmaco-epidemiology: methods of using medicines in real-life conditions (see Definition, justification, indications and interpretation of pharmaco-epidemiology studies 2C-323-DE-B01).

'''Effectiveness / efficiency''''

- Efficacy: Positive effect of treatment in clinical trials or laboratory studies.

- Efficiency: service provided by the treatment in real-life prescribing and use situations, once it is available to the public <br />.
