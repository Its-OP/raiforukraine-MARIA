'''External validity'''

*Elements of a clinical study enabling the reader to judge the applicability and generalisability (transposability) of the results to his/her patients.
*For a clinical trial: elements guaranteeing that the efficacy of the treatment evaluated, as estimated in the trial, can be extrapolated to real-life conditions of use.

'''External validity analysis''''

*Clinical relevance of results
*Characteristics of the individuals included: close to the population suffering from the disease (definition, severity, co-morbidities, etc).
**selection criteria that are too restrictive reduce the generalisability of the results
**a "pragmatic" trial defines broad selection criteria that are not very selective, as used in everyday practice.
**in contrast, an "explanatory" trial defines more stringent non-inclusion criteria (absence of co-morbidities, co-medications, age restriction, etc).
*Management methods in the study are close to those used in real-life conditions.
*Characteristics of the doctors/investigating centres included: experience, level of expertise, etc.
*Method of recruitment :
**Types of centres included (practices, general hospitals, university hospitals).
**Multicentre study vs. monocentre study
*Adherence to treatment: feasibility of administration and monitoring methods in daily practice.
