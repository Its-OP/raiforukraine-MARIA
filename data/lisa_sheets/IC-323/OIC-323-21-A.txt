|'''Part'''
|'''Content'''
|'''Questions to ask'''
|-
|'''Scientific rationale'''
|<nowiki>- Presenting the problem</nowiki>

- Synthesis of knowledge from previous research on the subject (literature) or research in progress (test register)

- Treatment/intervention data to be assessed

- Hypothesis(es) to be tested
|Is the question posed relevant, innovative and original?

'''Is this trial necessary in the light of current knowledge?'''
|-
|'''Objective'''
|<nowiki>- Main objective:</nowiki>

         . PICO formulation (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome)

         . Hypothesis (effectiveness, equivalence, non-inferiority)

- Possible secondary objective(s)
|'''Fully formulated objective(s)?''''
|-
|'''Type of study''''
|Comparative trial? Number of groups? Parallel groups, cross-over, etc.? Blind?

Treatment/intervention allocated to each group? Method of allocation (randomisation?)
|'''Adapted to the question asked?'''
|-
|'''Definition of eligible subjects'''
|Period, place and method of recruitment

Eligibility criteria (inclusion, non-inclusion, exclusion)
|'''External validity?''' (Corresponds to the characteristics of the target population?)
|-
|Randomisation
|<Ratio (1:1, other)? Block (balance during inclusions) ? Stratification, Minimisation (balance of certain factors in the two groups) ?

- Minimum time between inclusion-randomisation and randomisation-allocation

- Secret assignment?
|'''Internal validity ?''' (Limits selection bias and confusion bias)
|-
|'''Evaluated treatments''''
|<nowiki>- Precise description (dosage, route, duration, intervention, placebo, etc.)</nowiki>

- Blinding conditions and methods (double, single, triple, non-existent=open study)

- Evaluation of compliance, tolerance, comparable follow-up in the different groups, limiting the number of patients lost to follow-up...
|'''External validity?''' (Use encountered / possible in current practice?)

'''Internal validity ?''' (Classification bias)
|-
|'''Primary endpoint'''
|Precise definition and description of measurement method (how, by whom, blinded, etc.)

Independent award committee?
|External validity (easily assessed criteria)

'''Clinical relevance?'''

(Measurement inaccuracy, Classification bias)
|-
|'''Secondary endpoints''''
|<nowiki>- To support the primary endpoint or explore various aspects of the disease and thus evaluate the secondary objectives</nowiki>.

- Limited in number
|'''External validity?''' (easily assessable criteria)

'''Clinical relevance?'''

'''Internal validity?''' (Measurement imprecision, Classification bias, Repeated tests)
|-
|'''Number of subjects required''''
|Calculation explained with :

- definition of alpha and beta risk

- assumption about the value (mean and variance for a quantitative criterion, proportion for a binary criterion) of the outcome criterion in the control group

- definition of the minimum difference to be highlighted

- bilateral or unilateral test?

- efficacy, non-inferiority, equivalence?

- intermediate analyses?
|'''External validity?''' (Clinical relevance?)

'''Internal validity?''' (power)
|-
|Statistical analysis
|Descriptive analyses (Table 1)

Flow chart (protocol deviators), analysis population (intention to treat, per protocol).

Handling missing data.

Risk Î± (generally 5%), one-tailed or two-tailed tests.

Planning sub-group analyses

Consideration of prognostic factors
|Appropriate?

'''Internal validity''' ? (Assessment of the extent of selection and classification bias? Consideration of possible confounding factors).
|-
|'''Ethical and regulatory'''''
|Informed participants, signature of consent

Protection of health data
|'''CPP opinion? CNIL authorisation or compliance?''''
<br />

|'''Bibliography'''
|References to justify the relevance of the research question and the methods used
|'''Fair and complete?''''
