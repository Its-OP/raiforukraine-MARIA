'''Definition of secret assignment (''"allocation concealment"'')''''

*The act of not revealing to the doctor (or the patient) what treatment the patient will receive when deciding on inclusion in a therapeutic trial.
*By extension: all the measures implemented to ensure compliance with secret assignment in a randomised controlled trial.
*Synonyms: ignorance clause, non-disclosure of allocation, or masking of allocation.

'''Objective'''

*To avoid the potential selection bias that would be implied by knowledge of the treatment assigned by randomisation in order to include or exclude patients in the trial.
*Example: Randomised trial comparing laparoscopy vs laparotomy, and absence of a surgeon able to perform laparoscopy at night => non-inclusion of patients requiring surgery at night if prior knowledge that laparoscopy will be allocated by randomisation.

'''Adequate methods''': methods implying that the treatment assigned by randomisation can only be revealed after the patient has been included in the study.

*Best method = centralised randomisation via a computer or telephone server: the treatment assigned by randomisation is only revealed once the eligibility criteria have been met and the patient has actually been included in the study.
*Sealed, opaque and sequentially numbered envelopes, which are practical in emergency situations (but there is always a risk that the investigator will open an envelope for one patient and allocate the randomisation group to another patient if the randomisation arm is not suitable).
*If drugs: drugs prepared by the pharmacy in identical containers (also allows double-blinding).

'''Remarks:'''

*Any method of assigning treatments that is not random does not respect secret assignment.
**Examples: administering each of the treatments alternately to a patient according to their year of birth (example: even year = treatment A, odd = treatment B) or to every 2nd patient (A, then B, then A, then B ...), etc.
