'''Comparison of two (or more) groups of individuals in a sample'''

*Purpose: to determine the existence and magnitude of a difference between groups (cf. effect size).
*Risk: falsely asserting that the difference observed between the groups in the sample exists in the study's target population (cf. significance).

'''Effect size'''

It is generally expressed as a difference or ratio, may be absolute or relative, and depends on the nature of the assessment criterion being evaluated (qualitative, quantitative, censored data).

The table below sets out the main measures of effect size, but is not exhaustive

*See [[Crude or adjusted measures of association, difference of means, Absolute risk reduction (ARR), Relative risk reduction (RRR), Number needed to treat (NNT) and Crude incidence rate ratio 2C-020-DE-A08]].
*cf. [[Odds ratio, relative risk: estimation 2C-020-DE-A09]]<br />

(e.g. the relationship between weight and height)

|Linear correlation coefficient (r)
|Takes on a value between -1 and 1.
The closer to 1 (in absolute value) the relationship between the variables is linear (y = a x + b with a ≠ 0).

|Coefficient of determination (r²)
|Takes values between 0 and 1.
Corresponds to the square of the correlation coefficient. Evaluates the proportion of the variability of one variable explained by the other.

|Average difference between the two groups, related to the standard deviation (Cohen's coefficient).

(e.g. comparison of cancer risk according to exposure to tobacco)
|Odds Ratio
|Approximation of the relative risk, the more precise the rarer the event studied. This is the ratio of the odds of being sick or not sick according to the existence or absence of exposure.
Always positive, < 1 if there is a protective factor, > 1 if there is a risk factor.

|-
|Relative risk
|Ratio of the probability of being ill (or of the event studied) if exposed to the probability of being ill if not exposed.
Always positive, < 1 if there is a protective factor, > 1 if there is a risk factor

|'''Study of the link between a judgment criterion of the censored variable type and a qualitative or quantitative variable'''
(e.g. comparison of survival according to two different treatments for pancreatic cancer)
|Hazard Ratio
|Ratio of the instantaneous risks of occurrence of the event of interest between exposed and non-exposed individuals. Interpreted as a relative risk.
Always positive, < 1 if there is a protective factor, > 1 if there is a risk factor.

'''Significance'''

*Represents the probability that a difference as large as or larger than that observed will occur under the null hypothesis of no difference (see item 20).
*Depends on the amplitude of the difference (called the effect size) and the variance of the measurement, and therefore the size of the sample (thus, a very small effect size, which is not clinically relevant, may be statistically significant if it is observed on a very large sample).
