Before a new medicine can be granted marketing authorisation (MA), it must undergo a series of pre-clinical tests and phase I, II and III clinical trials.

'''<u>Preclinical phase: in vitro and animal model studies</u>''''

*To obtain the information deemed necessary prior to initial administration in humans.
*Carried out on animals or using in vitro tests.
*Objectives :
**Determination of acute single-dose toxicity, chronic or repeated-dose toxicity, effect on reproductive functions, mutagenic effect on cells, and carcinogenic effect.
**Obtain initial pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data to determine the compound's mechanism of action and the most appropriate route of administration.

'''<u>Clinical phase: studies in humans</u>''''

'''Phase I clinical trials: first administration to humans'''

Objectives:

*Determining the maximum tolerated dose
*determine the best mode of administration
*Determining the safety profile and adverse reactions
*Obtain pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.
*Which subjects?
**Healthy volunteers: most often, if the expected toxicity is limited.
**Sick patients: in the event of probable toxicity (oncology, AIDS, etc.).

Terms and conditions :

*Administration of the drug in increasing doses (dose escalation) or of a single dose repeated in a small number of subjects (generally 10 to 30 subjects).

'''Phase II clinical trials: Pharmacological efficacy'''

Objectives:

*First estimate of efficacy in humans: to obtain initial data on the efficacy of a new treatment.
*To clarify short-term safety in patients (= confirmation of safety assessed in phase I).
*Sometimes :
**Determine the optimal effective dose, dosage regimen and galenic formulation to be used in phase III.
**Study dose-effect and concentration-effect relationships.
**Obtain pharmacokinetic data from patients

Terms and conditions :

*Administration of the drug to patients in selected homogeneous groups.
*Administration of several different doses, sometimes using several different formulations.
*With or without a control group (most often without a control group).
*The endpoint is often an intermediate endpoint that can be obtained quickly rather than a clinical endpoint (e.g. bone densitometry vs. femoral neck fracture).

'''Phase III clinical trials: Therapeutic efficacy'''

Objective:

*Determine clinical efficacy compared with reference treatment or placebo.
*To assess short- and medium-term safety.
*Obtain the indication and marketing authorisation (MA) for the drug (sometimes MA is granted directly after a phase II trial, e.g. rare diseases, certain oncology situations).

Terms and conditions :

*A randomised, comparative study, ideally double-blind, carried out on a sufficient number of subjects to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy in the target population for the potential indication of the medicinal product.
*The duration of follow-up is usually long enough to assess a clinically relevant therapeutic effect.

'''Phase IV trials: Post-marketing studies (see [[Definition, rationale, indications and interpretation of pharmaco-epidemiology studies 2C-323-DE-B01]])''''

Pharmacovigilance objectives :

*Monitor the safety of the drug under real conditions of use.
*Detecting adverse reactions that are too rare or occur over too long a period to have been detected during the previous evaluation phase.
*describe drug interactions
*To specify the methods of administration under real conditions of use (population not studied in the trials).

Terms and conditions :

*Refers to all studies carried out on a drug after it has been granted marketing authorisation and marketed.
*Observational approach involving a very large number of patients treated as part of their care.
