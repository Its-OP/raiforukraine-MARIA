There are many secondary immune deficiencies:

infectious diseases:

*human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (+++);
*measles ;
*other viral infections (EBV, etc.);

'''malignant pathologies''' :

*myeloma;
*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia;
*solid tumours (rare, e.g. thymoma with hypogammaglobulinemia: Good's syndrome);

'''autoimmune diseases''': mainly systemic lupus erythematosus;

'''iatrogenic origin''': the context here is more obvious:

*corticosteroid therapy;
*immunosuppressive<s>s</s>, particularly post-transplant;
*Biotherapies (anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-1);
*any cytotoxic chemotherapy;

'''other causes''' :

*hypogammaglobulinaemia due to immunoglobulin leakage (nephrotic syndrome, exudative diarrhoea, burns) or immunoglobulin production failure (certain anti-comitic treatments);
*diabetes, which in particular favours pyogenic bacterial infections;

Surgical or functional asplenia, associated with an increased risk of encapsulated germ infections (''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'') and severe malaria; there are also congenital asplenias which are part of hereditary immune deficiencies.

'''Cushing's syndrome;'''

'''Deep malnutrition;'''

'''End-stage renal and hepatic failure...'''
