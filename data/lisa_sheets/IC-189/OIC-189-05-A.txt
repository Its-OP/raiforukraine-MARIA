Depending on the type of immunosuppressant (IS), the risks of infection are different.

It is important to remember

* IS can disrupt various immune responses (e.g. corticosteroids).
* SIs are often combined with one another, which increases the risks.
* The disease or situation for which IS are prescribed may be the cause of immunodepression.


1/ Immunosuppressants inducing a humoral immunity deficit

* Infections: encapsulated bacteria: Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae.
* Responsible drugs: Rituximab ++, prolonged corticosteroid therapy.


'''2/ Immunosuppressants inducing a cellular immunity deficit'''

* Infections: intracellular germs (PNEUMOCYSTOSIS+++, but also viruses (shingles, CMV...), mycobacteria, fungi (Candida...), parasites (toxoplasmosis).
* Responsible drugs": prolonged corticosteroid therapy, certain chemotherapies used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphomas (fludarabine, bendamustine), immunosuppressants used in solid organ transplants and the treatment of auto-immune diseases: azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, anti-calcineurins (ciclosporin, tacrolimus), etc.


3/ Immunosuppressants inducing neutropenia

* Infections: pyogenic bacteria and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus).
* Responsible drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy (NB: frequently associated with alteration of the mucosal barrier (mucositis)).


4/ Anti-cytokine drugs

* Infections: tuberculosis but also infections with pyogens and other intracellular germs.
* Anti-cytokine drugs
