*repeated ENT and pulmonary bacterial infections (almost 100% of cases)
*autoimmunity: mainly organ-related: autoimmune cytopenias (anaemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia), Biermer's disease, thyroiditis, sometimes systemic (connective tissue disease) (25% of cases)
*lymphoproliferative syndrome: generalised adenopathies and/or splenomegaly (40% of cases)
*chronic diarrhoea: infection by parasites (Giardia) or bacteria (Campylobacter, Salmonella), lymphoid nodular hyperplasia (20 to 50% of cases)
*granulomatosis: the diagnosis of CVID should be made in the presence of granulomatosis if there is hypogammaglobulinaemia. (10-20% of cases)
