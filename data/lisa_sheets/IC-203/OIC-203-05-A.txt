The clinical elements will allow an initial etiological orientation:

* Dyspnoea with wheezing
** Asthma: young subject, atopy, variability of symptoms, usually nocturnal
** COPD: smoking, everything, bronchial rales
** Heart failure: history and CV risk factors, orthopnoea.
* Dyspnoea with tele-inspiratory crackles:
** o Diffuse infiltrative pneumonitis: dry cough, search for systemic disease.
** Heart failure: history and CV FDR, orthopnoea.
* Normal auscultation:
** Ventilatory pump disease (neuromuscular, skeletal, obesity)
** Pulmonary vascular disease (PAH)
** Anaemia
* Asymmetric auscultation: pleural pathology
