Identify/recognise the different imaging examinations (type/window/sequences/incidences/injection)

'''Acute dyspnoea:'''

*Chest radiography is systematic. It is used to determine etiology.
*Other investigations will be discussed on the basis of initial indications.
**CT angiography, ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy and venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs if pulmonary embolism is suspected (see venous thromboembolism item).
**Cardiac ultrasound if acute left ventricular failure is suspected (especially in the case of a first episode).


Chronic dyspnoea

*Chest X-ray is systematic. It is used to determine etiology (distension, interstitial syndrome, cardiomegaly).
*Cardiac ultrasound if heart disease is suspected.
*As a second line of defence, a chest CT scan should be ordered if diffuse infiltrative pathology is suspected.
