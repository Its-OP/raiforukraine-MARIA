- Foreign body: suspected especially in the oldest children and the elderly.

- Laryngitis or epiglottitis: rare diagnosis, especially in children

- Bronchopulmonary cancer: dyspnoea is rarely the main complaint except in cases of proximal involvement (tracheal or bronchial) or complications such as pleurisy.

- Metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis): dyspnoea without hypoxaemia and without any clinical or radiological abnormality in the lungs.
