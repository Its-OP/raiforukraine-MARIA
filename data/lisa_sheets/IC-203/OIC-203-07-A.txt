'''Acute dyspnoea:'''

- A frontal chest X-ray can be used to investigate the majority of causes of acute dyspnoea (pneumothorax, pleurisy, pneumonia, OAP). A normal chest X-ray, or one with no significant abnormalities, should raise the possibility of pulmonary embolism, COPD, asthma or anaemia.

- ECG: search for evidence of cardiac pathology and pulmonary embolism.

- Biology: CBC, BNP or NT-proBNP, blood gas (mainly to check for signs of seriousness: profound hypoxaemia, respiratory acidosis).

'''Chronic dyspnoea:''''

- CBC, to rule out anaemia,

- BNP or NT-proBNP in cases of suspected heart disease

- ECG to check for heart disease

- Chest X-ray for aetiological orientation (distension, interstitial syndrome, cardiomegaly).
