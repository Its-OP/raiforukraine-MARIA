A foreign body should never be considered absent on a normal X-ray, which studies have shown to be the case in up to 30% of cases. The foreign body is more often located on the right.

Radiopaque foreign bodies are the least frequently encountered (10% of cases).

Radiological signs are therefore usually indirect signs:

             Asymmetry of lung transparency

Lobar or segmental pulmonary atelectasis: a retractile, systematised opacity which draws the mediastinum towards the atelectasis side (in favour of complete obstruction). If present for a long time, this is the anomaly most often visualised.

              Lobar or segmental pulmonary emphysema: systematised hyperclarity which pushes back the mediastinum on the contralateral side

Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum may be seen as a result of coughing.
