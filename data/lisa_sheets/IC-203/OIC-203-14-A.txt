Step 1: rule out upper airway obstruction

- these obstructions represent an extreme emergency

- their management differs radically from that of other causes of acute respiratory distress

- it is above all a clinical diagnosis

'''2nd stage: orienting the aetiological diagnosis'''

* depending on thoracic imaging
** pleural pathology: pneumothorax, pleurisy
** parenchymal opacities: infectious pneumonitis, pulmonary oedema, diffuse infiltrative pneumonitis
** normal or subnormal chest X-ray: acute severe asthma, pulmonary embolism
* depending on gasometric disturbances: increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> and/or bicarbonates, which may point to decompensation of a chronic respiratory pathology (COPD, ventilatory pump pathology).
