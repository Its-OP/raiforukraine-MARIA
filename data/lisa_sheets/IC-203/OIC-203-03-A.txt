For details of the different pathologies and their clinical signs, please refer to the corresponding courses.

* Upper airway obstruction
** Inspiratory dyspnoea, dysphonia
** Cornet (inspiratory noise)
* Pneumothorax :
** Sudden dyspnoea with pleural chest pain.
** Asymmetric reduction in vesicular murmur and tympany opposite.
* Pleuresis
** Progressive exertional dyspnoea, sometimes with associated pleural pain
** Asymmetric reduction in vesicular murmur and dullness opposite, reduced transmission of vocal vibrations.
* Infectious pneumonia
** Dyspnoea +/- progressive, + /- cough and sputum, febrile context, pleural pain
** Localized crackles
* Pulmonary oedema
** Cardiovascular history and risk factors, exertional dyspnoea, sometimes rapid onset, orthopnoea, frothy or pink sputum.
** Symmetrical crackles at the base of the lungs (sometimes sibilant), abnormal cardiac auscultation, signs of right heart failure.
* Pulmonary embolism
** Sudden dyspnoea with pleural chest pain, haemoptoic sputum may be present.
** Few orienting clinical signs. Look for signs of deep vein thrombosis.
* Severe acute asthma
** Dyspnoea +/- paroxysmal with recent increase, wheezing, cough, mucous sputum.
