Definition: perception of uncomfortable or painful breathing experienced during various situations (rest or exercise) which do not usually cause any discomfort.

*Inspiratory dyspnoea suggests pathology of the upper airways (supracarinal).
*Expiratory dyspnoea points to bronchial pathology (COPD, asthma).
*Dyspnoea at both times points to a number of other diagnoses (alveolar, vascular, neuromuscular pathologies, etc.).
