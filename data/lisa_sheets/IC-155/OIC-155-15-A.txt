'''Non-necrotising bacterial dermohypodermatitis, in adults'''

- most often located in the lower limbs (70-90% of cases)

- other locations: upper limb in 5-10% of cases (breast neoplasia in women), face (5% of cases)

The location in children is different, with a less clear-cut predominance of lower limb locations (skin entry point: superinfection of chickenpox lesions).


''Necrotizing bacterial dermohypodermatitis,'' the most frequent sites are those mentioned above.
