|'''Dermatophytes''''
|'''Yeasts'''
|-
|'''Infectious agents'''
|Filamentous and keratinophilic microscopic fungi
|Unicellular microscopic fungi, ovoid or spherical in shape, usually commensals of the skin and mucous membranes.
|-
|
|Always pathogenic
|Pathogenic under favourable circumstances
|-
|'''Genus'''
|Epidermophyton

Microsporum

Trichophyton
|Candida albicans +++''

Malassezia spp.
|-
|'''Clinical presentation'''
|
|
|-
|Oral
|No dermatophytes in the mucous membranes.
|Perlèche'' (intertrigo of the labial commissure, uni- or bilateral, where the bottom of the fold is erythematous, fissured or even macerated)

'''Glossitis''' (depilated red tongue)

'''Stomatitis''' (xerostomia; dysgeusia; shiny, red, glazed and painful mucosa)

'''Thrush''' (diffuse erythema of the oral mucosa, small adherent whitish deposits)
|-
|Skin
|Rounded or polycyclic (coalescing) plaques, highly suggestive vesicular and/or scaly erythematous border; centrifugal course with central healing.
|Exceptional (in neonates or immunocompromised patients)
|-
|Scalp
|Microsporic ringworm

Large, scaly alopecic plaques, single or few in number, rounded, centrifugal in extension.

Hair regularly broken a few millimetres from the skin

Trichophytic moths

Multiple small scattered alopecic plaques, scaly or squamous-crusted, sometimes pustular, engulfing hair that is broken when it emerges.
|Candidiasis folliculitis or Malassezia folliculitis of the scalp (inflammation and painful suppuration of the pilosebaceous follicle).
|-
|Genital
|'''No dermatophyte damage'''
|Candidiasis vulvovaginitis:

erythematous and oedematous lesions,

then a whitish coating and abundant yellowish-white leucorrhoea, which stagnates in the folds of the vulvovaginal mucosa,

intense pruritus ± dyspareunia ;

extension to the inguinal and intergluteal folds

Balanite and balano-posthite

unspecific erythematous lesions, rarely pustular, of the glans, balanopreputial fold and/or prepuce
<br />
|-
|Nail
|Toes +++

Inconsistent leukonychia, then subungual hyperkeratosis, then onycholysis due to distal detachment of the nail plate.
<br />Perior nail
|Peri-onyxis (hands+++):

painful swelling of the matrix area and supraungual fold ± pus ;

secondary invasion of the nail plate (''onyxis''), taking on a greenish-brown colour in the proximal and lateral regions
|-
|Intertrigo of the great folds
|Bistre-coloured placard, centrifugal evolution, central healing and active erythematosquamous ± vesicular border with fine epidermal detachment.

Fold base neither erythematous nor cracked

Inguinal fold in men +++ (often associated with foot involvement)
|Intertrigo with an erythematous base covered by a creamy, malodorous coating, frequent fissures at the base of the fold, pustular border or desquamative collar.
<Infant breech fungus
|-
|Small fold intertrigo
|Inter-toe

Dry or oozing desquamation, ± fissuring, sometimes vesiculo-bullae on the inside of the toes, space

4th and 5th toes most often
|Hands +++ (contact with water, frequent use of household gloves), feet
