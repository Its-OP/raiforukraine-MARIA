'''Non-necrotising bacterial dermohypodermatitis'''

'''Outpatient treatment, except''''

- presence of local or general signs of seriousness,

- existence of an associated disease at risk of decompensation: immunosuppression, diabetes, heart failure, renal failure, obesity.

- extreme ages (newborn or very old)

- failure to respond satisfactorily to treatment within 72 hours of initiation

- and also for the child: difficulties in understanding or communicating with family and friends, suggesting difficulties in monitoring at home


'''In adults,'''

- oral antibiotic therapy for 7 days against Streptococcus pyogene

amoxicillin: 50 mg/kg/day in 3 doses with a maximum of 6 g/day; if allergic to penicillin: pristinamycin (1 g x 3/day) or clindamycin (600 mg x 3/day, and up to 600 mg x 4/day if weight > 100 kg).

In children,

- oral antibiotic therapy for 7 days against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes

amoxicillin-clavulanic acid: 80 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin taken 3 times a day (but not more than 3g/day); if allergic to ÃŸ-lactams: clindamycin: 40 mg/kg/day in 3 doses per day (children > 6 years); or ''sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim'': 30 mg/kg/day (expressed as sulfamethoxazole) in 3 doses per day (drinkable suspension form for children < 6 years).


'''Associated measures'''

No local antibiotic therapy

Do not prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Rest with elevation of the affected limb

Prophylactic anticoagulation to be discussed according to the patient's thrombo-embolic risk factors

Wearing an effective venous support as soon as pain improves

Treatment of the gateway (intertrigo)

Update of tetanus vaccination if necessary

'''Necrotizing bacterial dermohypodermatitis'''

This is a life-threatening emergency requiring rapid medical and surgical management in an intensive care unit, with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and early surgical debridement.
