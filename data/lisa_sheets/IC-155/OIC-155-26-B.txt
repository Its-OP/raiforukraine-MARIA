'''Favouring factors'''

- Factor: contact with a person infected with "Staphylococcus aureus" LPV+ during a mainly intra-familial contact

- Nasal carriage can encourage recurrence

- Comorbidities such as diabetes or HIV infection

'''Examinations to be carried out'''

- Isolated boil: no bacteriological sample taken.

- Boils at risk of complications or furunculosis: take a bacteriological sample and look for favourable factors (HIV, diabetes, hypogammaglobulinaemia).
