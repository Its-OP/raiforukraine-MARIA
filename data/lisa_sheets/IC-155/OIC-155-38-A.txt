'''Non-necrotising bacterial dermohypodermatitis of the face''' (infection with ''Streptococcus'' ''pyogenes''): unilateral inflammatory placard, very well limited, sometimes with a peripheral bulge.


'''Facial cellulitis of dental origin''' :

1) ''Serous'' stage: ''edematous erythematous inflammatory placard'' (non-fluctuating), gingival inflammation, and presence of a tooth with deep caries.

2) ''Collected'' stage: after 3-4 days of evolution: worsening of local inflammatory signs, permanent and pulsatile pain, insomniac and the presence of fluctuation on palpation. Presence of trismus (in the case of posterior dental involvement).

3) Gangrenous stage: marked general signs (fever to 40Â°C, septic shock), rapid spread of cutaneous signs, possible crepitus on palpation.

'''Staphylococcie maligne de la face'''

Very rare.

Manipulated boil, centro-facial topography, inflammatory placard with poorly defined edges, and significant general signs. Signs of thrombophlebitis of the [[Anatomy:Cavernous sinus|cavernous sinus]] should be sought (headache, facial venous cord, exophthalmos, ophthalmoplegia, papilledema, unilateral decrease in visual acuity).
