'''Non-necrotizing bacterial dermohypodermatitis''' (NNHD): an acute non-necrotizing infection of bacterial origin, involving skin tissue, mainly due to group A Î²-hemolytic streptococcus (''Streptococcus pyogenes'').


Bacterial necrotising dermohypodermatitis (BHND) and necrotising fasciitis (NF): necrotising infections of the dermis and hypodermis that can reach the muscle, with production of endo- and exotoxins, threatening the vital prognosis. This is a medical and surgical emergency.
