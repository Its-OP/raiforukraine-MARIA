In the case of a "complicated furuncle" or one at risk of complication (i.e. furuncles in the mid-facial region, multiple furuncles, debilitated patients), systemic antibiotic therapy against Staphyloccus aureus is recommended, after a bacteriological sample has been taken, and without waiting for the results.

The recommended duration of treatment is 5 days.
