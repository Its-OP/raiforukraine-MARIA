Certain elements of the anatomopathological analysis make it possible to specify the patient's prognosis. These include

- degree of invasion,

- degree of differentiation,

- TNM stage,

- histopronostic grade for certain tumours (Gleason score for prostate cancer, etc.),

- molecular prognostic factors for certain tumours (BRAF mutation associated with a poor prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancer, Ki-67 in neuro-endocrine tumours, for example).
