Once the diagnosis of malignancy has been established, or in cases where there is a very strong suspicion of cancer (e.g. multi-metastatic disease), paraclinical examinations are prescribed with two objectives:

- assess the extent of the disease in order to differentiate between a curable situation (aiming to cure the cancer) and an incurable situation, also known as palliative;

- to assess the patient's condition, the severity of any co-morbidities and any complications of the cancer, in order to determine possible treatments during a so-called pre-therapeutic assessment.
