The biological changes that may lead to the suspicion of cancer or reinforce the suspicion of cancer in the case of associated clinical signs are :

- Biological signs associated with a cachectic and inflammatory syndrome: fall in albumin and prealbumin, rise in CRP and fibrinogen;

- Biological signs associated with a mass syndrome: disturbed organ function (icteric cholestasis, onset of diabetes), elevated LDH, hypercalcaemia (due to bone metastasis), biological spontaneous tumour lysis syndrome;

- Biological signs associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome: hypercalcaemia (due to secretion of PTH-rp), hyponatraemia (inappropriate secretion of ADH), abnormal hormone levels or results suggestive of autoimmunity.
