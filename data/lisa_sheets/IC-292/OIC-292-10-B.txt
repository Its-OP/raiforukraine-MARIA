The tumour nomenclature is based on the following categories: carcinoma (epithelium) / melanoma / sarcoma (connective tissue) / glioma, astrocytoma, etc. (neurological tissue) / myeloma, lymphoma and leukaemia (haematopoietic tissue) / germ cell and embryonal tumour (seminoma, blastoma, embryonic tissue).

For certain tumours, histopronostic grades have been validated (Gleason score for prostate cancer, Elston-Ellis classification (modified SBR) for breast cancer, for example), making it possible to specify the patient's prognosis and adapt therapeutic strategies.

The staging of tumours groups each site into relatively homogeneous groups in terms of prognosis and treatment. Staging is generally based on classification. Broadly speaking, these are :

- Stage 0: in situ cancer ;

- Stage 1: single, small tumour, no lymph node involvement or metastases;

- Stage 2: localised to the organ of origin, almost never involving lymph nodes;

- Stage 3: locoregional extension to neighbouring organs and/or lymph node involvement ;

- Stage 4: distant metastatic disease.
