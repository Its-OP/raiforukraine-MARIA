The diagnosis of cancer is made by histological or cytological examination of a sample of tumour tissue (see item 293), whether it is the primary tumour or a metastatic lesion. The choice of invasive diagnostic examination (cytological puncture, biopsy, surgical specimen) depends on the benefit/risk balance of the various possible examinations, which depends on the accessibility of the various tumour sites and the cost-effectiveness of the type of sample taken.

The anatomo-cytopathological examination of the tumour sample provides answers to three major questions:

1/ confirmation of the diagnosis ("anatomopathological proof"): benign/malignant tumour; tissue of origin of the cancer;

2/ assessment of prognosis ;

3/ theranostic evaluation, in search of a molecular anomaly in the tumour (targeted therapy) or evaluation of the response to treatment by immunotherapy, making it possible to personalise treatments: expression of hormone receptors and anti-hormonal treatment in breast cancer, EGFR mutation and treatment with EGFR inhibitors (tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors) in lung cancer for example, expression of PD-L1 and treatment with immunotherapy (anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1) in lung cancer for example.
