In addition to stage or TNM classification, other prognostic factors may be taken into account in the therapeutic decision and may affect the proposed treatment. These include :

- patient-specific clinical prognostic factors: performance status, undernutrition, comorbidities;

- clinical prognostic factors specific to the clinical impact of the cancer: presence of bone metastases with or without neurological complications, metastases at risk of bleeding or organ dysfunction linked to tumour invasion.
