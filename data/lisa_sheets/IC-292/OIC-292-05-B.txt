Paraneoplastic syndromes are systemic manifestations, remote from the cancer, which are not due to the presence of metastases but are linked to the tumour's production of a pseudohormonal substance or to autoimmune phenomena related to an anti-tumour immune response.

Venous thromboembolic disease is the most common paraneoplastic syndrome. It is particularly common in pancreatic and gastric cancers.

Paraneoplastic syndromes linked to autoimmunity are rare, but can be the first signs of any type of cancer and sometimes even precede detection. Paraneoplastic syndromes linked to a secretory syndrome (abnormal production of a substance by the tumour) are frequently associated with small-cell bronchial cancers and other neuroendocrine tumours (insulinoma, gastrinoma, carcinoid tumours of the small intestine, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, etc.).

Paraneoplastic syndromes generally subside with cancer treatment.
