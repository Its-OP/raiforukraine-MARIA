The clinical, biological and imaging signs associated with cancer disease can be grouped into 3 major syndromic entities:

- cachectic and inflammatory syndrome: all the signs associated with an alteration in general condition and an inflammatory state linked to cancer;

- tumour syndrome: all the clinical, radiological or biological signs associated with the presence of a primary tumour mass or metastases and its locoregional consequences (compression, invasion);

- paraneoplastic syndrome: set of signs associated with a functional secretory tumour or an autoimmune disease caused by cancer.
