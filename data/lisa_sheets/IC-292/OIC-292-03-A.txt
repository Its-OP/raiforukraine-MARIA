Cancer can be diagnosed :

- as part of organised screening, in an unselected population in a specific age group;

- by chance during a complementary examination carried out for a reason other than cancer screening or diagnosis;

- as part of a procedure initiated on the basis of a clinical or radiological suspicion.
