The oculomotor nerves originate in the brain stem, travel in the subarachnoid cisterns, then in the [[Anatomy:Cavernous sinus|cavernous sinus]], and end in the orbit on the oculomotor muscles. The medial longitudinal bundle (''former medial longitudinal band'') connects the nuclei of the IV and VI.

The motor neurons of the oculomotor nerves arise from nuclei located (Figure 1)
* in the midbrain, at the level of the superior colliculus (oculomotor nucleus, origin of the somatomotor fibres of III) and inferior colliculus (nucleus of the trochlear nerve),
* from the floor of the 4th ventricle to the bridge (abducens nerve nucleus).

Nerves III, IV and VI emerge at the surface of the brain stem (apparent origin) and travel in the subarachnoid cisterns (Figure 2):
*The oculomotor nerve (III) arises from the inter-peduncular fossa and travels between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, then close to the posterior communicating artery to reach the roof of the cavernous sinus.
*The trochlear nerve (IV) arises from the dorsal aspect of the brain stem, follows the superior cerebellar artery and the tentorial incisure to reach the posterior part of the roof of the cavernous sinus.
*The abducens nerve (VI) arises in the pontomedullary sulcus and travels towards the dorsal surface of the clivus, where it pierces the dura mater. It then travels through a dural split to reach the posterior part of the cavernous sinus.

The oculomotor (III) and trochlear (IV) nerves run in the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus (Figure 3A), accompanied by the ophthalmic nerve (V1). The lower limit of the cavernous sinus (red dotted line) passes through the upper border of the maxillary nerve (V2).

The abducens nerve (VI) runs in the cavernous sinus, in contact with the lateral border of the internal carotid artery.
They all enter the orbit via the superior orbital fissure (Figure 3B).

|}

The 4 rectus muscles attach to the sclera anterior to the equator, forming a cone and converging posteriorly on a densification of the optic nerve sheath (ring of tendons). The oblique muscles are inserted behind the equatorial plane and run obliquely (Figure 4).

The isolated action of these muscles is shown in B, as is their innervation by the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV) and abducens (VI) nerves.

==Faisceau longitudinal medial (FLM) ''former posterior longitudinal band'' ==
<br />

The FLM, located paramedian to the floor of the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle (Figure 1) connects the nucleus VI to the contralateral nucleus III: abduction of one eye automatically induces adduction of the contralateral eye. A unilateral lesion of the FLM induces horizontal diplopia due to a lack of these conjugated movements (internuclear ophthalmoplegia).
