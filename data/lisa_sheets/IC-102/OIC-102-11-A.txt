In the case of recent diplopia, a neurological examination and cerebral imaging should be performed as a priority.

Ill's paralysis associated with pupillary signs and pain requires an urgent search for an intracranial aneurysm.

Intracranial aneurysms, in particular [[Arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces|posterior communicating aneurysms and supraclinoid carotid aneurysms]], are responsible for III paralysis often associated with headaches.

In particular, an intracranial aneurysm should be suspected:

- in the event of partial oculomotor damage but with pupillary signs of intrinsic III damage;

- in young people;

- in the absence of vascular risk factors ;

- in the presence of headaches.

In these cases, urgent neuroradiological exploration using angioscan or MRI is essential; if the results are negative or doubtful, a cerebral arteriography should be considered if there is a strong clinical suspicion.
