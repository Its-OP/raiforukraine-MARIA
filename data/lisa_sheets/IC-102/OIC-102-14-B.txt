In the case of recent diplopia, a neurological examination and cerebral imaging are the first line of investigation.

'''The main associated signs to look for''' are:

- during questioning:

- the patient's background: age, ocular and general history, diabetes, arterial hypertension, metabolic or endocrine disease (particularly thyroid disease), history of neoplasia;

- circumstances of onset: trauma, physical exertion, reading or fatigue;

- mode of onset: sudden or gradual ;

- associated symptoms: pain, dizziness, headaches, nausea ;

- the characteristics of the diplopia: horizontal, vertical, oblique, as well as the gaze position in which the diplopia is maximal and its variations during the day

- inspection:

* a vicious or compensatory attitude of the head,
* a palpebral anomaly (ptosis, palpebral retraction)
* anisocoria
* an abnormality of the direct or consensual photomotor reflex
* skin abnormality (rash in the V territory)
* exophthalmos

- associated neurological signs


'''Main etiologies:''''

'''Vascular:'''

- Intracranial aneurysm (+++, posterior communicating aneurysm), particularly in young patients with Ill's paralysis associated with pupillary signs and pain. Urgent neuroradiological investigation.

- Ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular accidents

- Carotidocavernous fistula

'''Tumours:''' the cause of a quarter of oculomotor paralyses. Systematically request neuroradiological investigations.

- intracranial hypertension: bilateral VI paralysis with no localising value

- skull base tumours

'''Traumatic''': fracture of the floor of the orbit

'''Multiple sclerosis:''' revealed by oculomotor paralysis in 10% of cases.

- VI paralysis

- anterior internuclear palsy

'''Myasthenia:''' non-painful diplopia, fluctuating, worsening with fatigue, sometimes associated with variable ptosis.

Orbital involvement: Graves' disease, tumours of the orbit. Particularly if associated exophthalmos.   

'''If pain:''' rule out an intracranial aneurysm, carotid dissection or carotid-cavernous fistula. Diabetes is the most common cause of painful diplopia. Horton's disease presents in elderly patients with fronto-orbital headaches ± POM, ± NOIA.
