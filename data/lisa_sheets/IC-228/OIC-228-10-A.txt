The use of a [https://sides.uness.fr/lisa/Connaitre_les_principes_de_prise_en_charge_th%C3%A9rapeutiques_de_l%E2%80%99insuffisance_veineuse_chronique_2C-227-PC-B01 compression device] is essential in cases of venous insufficiency with or without varicose veins. In cases of post-thrombotic disease, specialist advice should be sought. Compression provides a mechanical means of combating oedema and orthostatic venous hyperpressure. It is the main treatment for venous ulcers.

==Venous ulcers ==
Compression is based on the use of bandages at the start of treatment, with the use of stockings or socks possible at a later stage. A high level of pressure is required (30-40 mm Hg, French class 3). It is preferable to use a multi-layer, multi-type compression (elastic bands and non-elastic bands) that is reapplied every two days. It is essential to ensure that the SPI is > 0.60.

Adherence ('''''[[Therapeutic Adherence Assessment SD-354|Therapeutic Adherence Assessment]]''''') to compression is around 50%, which explains the difficulties in healing and the recurrence of ulcers.

==Ulcers with an arterial component ==
The absolute contraindications are critical ischaemia and advanced diabetic microangiopathy.

The use of compression requires confirmation that there is no critical ischaemia and is also contraindicated if the ankle SPI is < 0.60.

Non-elastic compressions to combat oedema are not contraindicated.
