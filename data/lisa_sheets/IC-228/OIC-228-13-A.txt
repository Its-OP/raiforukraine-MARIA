Local treatment of a leg ulcer is combined with management of the vascular or non-vascular condition that caused it.

Every wound has its own dynamics, passing through 3 different stages in the healing process:

* detersion ("cleaning" of fibrin and necrosis by leukocytes and macrophages),
* budding,
* epidermisation.

In all cases, the date of the tetanus vaccination should be checked ('''''[[Vaccinations for adults and children SD-322|vaccinations for adults and children]]'''''). Nearly 2/3 of tetanus cases begin with a leg ulcer.
