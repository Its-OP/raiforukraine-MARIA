The ulcer is secondary to ischaemic tissue hypoxia following severe OSA (at the stage of chronic critical ischaemia).

== '''The arterial origin is evoked in the presence of an ulcer:''' ==

*Suspended,
*painful,
*small in size,
*crusty (with risk of exposing joints and tendons),
*with sharp edges,
*often recent,
*typically located in the foot,
*atonic background.

== '''In the case of an arterial ulcer, we look for:''' ==

*Atheroma: epidemiology and pathophysiology. The polyatheromatous patient|cardiovascular risk factors]] ;
*arterial disease of the aorta, visceral arteries and lower limbs; aneurysms|a history of exertional ischaemia]] (intermittent claudication);
*decubitus pain;
*a reduction in skin heat;
*longer pulp recolouration time;
*a lack of exposure of the digital pulps and heel shells;
*declivity erythrocyanosis;
*abolition of peripheral pulses.

== '''When faced with an arterial ulcer, we ask:''' ==

*Doppler ultrasound of the aorta and arteries of the lower limbs: this examination confirms arterial disease and locates significant arterial lesions;
*A haemodynamic measurement is essential if symptoms are to be attributed to AOMI:
**ankle pressure < 50 mmHg ;
**toe pressure < 30 mmHg;
**TcPO2 < 30 mmHg.

'''''Other values have been proposed by other classifications. '''''

The values suggested here are used to determine whether the AOMI is associated with a resting symptom. Ankle pressure is often falsely normal or elevated (diabetes, renal failure, old age, etc.), in which case toe pressure should be measured.

'''''On complete, if arterial imaging indicates revascularisation:'''''

*angioscan,
*MRI angiography (particularly for leg artery lesions).
