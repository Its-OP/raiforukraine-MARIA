==Venous ulcer ==
Venous ulcers are caused by hyper-pressure of the skin due to venous stasis. This is generally secondary to a varicose disease [[Chronic venous insufficiency. Varicose veins|(incontinence of the superficial venous network]] or [[Post-thrombotic syndrome 2C-227-DE-A02|a post-thrombotic disease]] (devalvulation or occlusion of the deep venous network).

This venous hyperpressure leads to tissue damage at the microcirculatory level with

*Alteration of the endothelial barrier, with the passage of plasma, macromolecules and figurative elements from the blood into the interstitial sector,
*leukocyte diapedesis leading to inflammatory phenomena,
*formation of pericapillary fibrin mantles.

This leads to local tissue hypoxia, which is the cause of chronic skin loss.

==Arterial ulcer ==
The arterial ulcer is secondary to ischaemic tissue hypoxia following [[Arteriopathy of the aorta, visceral arteries and lower limbs; aneurysms|severe ischaemia]] (at the stage of chronic critical ischaemia).

== ''Mixed ulcer (ulcer with arterial component)'' ==
This is an ulcer combining several aetiological components. For example, a venous ulcer which does not heal because of associated arterial disease.
