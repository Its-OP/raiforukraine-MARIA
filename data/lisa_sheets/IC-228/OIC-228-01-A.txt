Leg ulcers

- chronic loss of dermal substance that has been evolving for more than one month ([[Cutaneous ulcer SD-092|cutaneous ulcer]]; [[Wound SD-170|wound]]).

- prevalence increases with age: 1% after 60, 5% after 80.

- most often of vascular origin: venous, microcirculatory or arterial.

- Ulcer treatment is first and foremost aetiological and not just local.
