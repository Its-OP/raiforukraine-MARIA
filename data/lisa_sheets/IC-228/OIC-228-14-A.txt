== '''Local treatment''' ==
The sole aim of local treatment is to encourage the detersion of necrotic tissue and subsequent healing. Local treatment does not dispense with etiological treatment.

== Exudate management ==
Exudate must be managed using dressings that are sufficiently absorbent. Inadequate exudate management leads to peri-ulcer maceration dermatitis, a factor in ulcer extension.

== '''Detersion''' ==
Cleaning is done with water or physiological saline, avoiding antiseptics and local antibiotics. Detersion is mechanical, using a curette, brush, etc. It is necessary but must not cause pain. It will be carried out with an appropriate analgesic treatment and/or after local anaesthesia ('''''[[Prevention of pain associated with treatment SD-258|prevention of pain associated with treatment]]'''''). The extent of lesions or pain may justify detersion in the operating theatre.
