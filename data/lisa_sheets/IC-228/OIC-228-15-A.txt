Various complications can arise in the event of an ulcer.

== '''Skin allergies''' ==
Skin allergies to the topicals used are very common ( '''''[[Erythema SD-085|erythema]] [[Acute big red leg SD-087|acute big red leg]]'''''). The usual treatment is based on the use of dermocorticoids ('''''[[Prescribe general or local corticosteroids SD-251|prescribe general or local corticosteroids]]''''') and avoidance of the allergen, most often a product present in the dressing (balsam of Peru, iodine).

== '''Infection''' ==
The presence of bacteria on an ulcer is a normal phenomenon of bacterial colonisation. Bacteriological samples are therefore not taken systematically.

A combination of certain criteria may suggest local superinfection (emergence of a pathogenic strain), which may lead to specific local treatment such as a silver dressing, the duration of which is regulated at a maximum of 4 weeks.

There is no indication for the use of antibiotic ointments. Infections such as erysipelas, cellulitis and lymphangitis should be treated with systemic antibiotics ('''''[[Acute big red leg SD-087|acute big red leg]]''''').

== '''Malignant transformation''' ==
Any abnormal budding of a chronic ulcer that does not heal should raise the suspicion of carcinomatous transformation. A skin biopsy of the suspected area should be performed if there is the slightest doubt.

== '''Tetanus''' ==
Tetanus vaccination must be checked. Nearly two-thirds of cases of tetanus are caused by leg ulcers.
