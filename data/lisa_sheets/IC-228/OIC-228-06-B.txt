[[File:Necrotic angiodermatitis.jpg|vignette|549.133x549.133px|Necrotic angiodermatitis]]
The diagnosis of necrotic angiodermatitis is made in the presence of an ulcer:

*of the anterolateral aspect of the leg;
*with areas of superficial necrosis ;
*with irregular margins
*with a cyanotic and livedoid ulcerated rim;
*very painful, sleepless ('''[[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]]''').

We are looking for :

*arterial hypertension in adults and children, ([[Arterial hypertension SD-042|SDD-042]])
*Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications|diabetes]],
*the presence of pulses (there is no arteriopathy in angiodermatitis).
