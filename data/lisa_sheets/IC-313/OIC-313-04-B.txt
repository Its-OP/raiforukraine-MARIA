*Personal or family history (1st degree)
*[[2C-050|Cryptorchidism 50]] even if operated by testicular lowering (allows easier monitoring of the testicle)
*Testicular atrophy (<12 ml) (torsion, infection, trauma, syndromic diseases: Klinefelter, Down)
*[[2C-050|Testicular dysgenesis syndrome 50]]: infertility, atrophy (<12 ml), cryptorchidism, hypospadias
*Syndromic diseases: Down, Klinefelter
*Regular use of [[2C-078|cannabis 78]].
*Under study: exposure to pesticides, endocrine disruptors, organic solvents, etc.
*Isolated testicular microlithiasis is not a risk factor but requires biannual ultrasound monitoring when associated with risk factors for testicular cancer.
