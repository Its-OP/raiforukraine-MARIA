- <u>Interrogation</u>

o search for risk factors: cryptorchidism, atrophy (<12 ml), Klinefelter, cannabis, hypo or infertility, family or personal history, cannabis use, exposure to pesticides, endocrine disruptors, organic solvents, etc.

o evolution

o pain

- <u>Clinical examination</u>

o a hard, irregular, painless mass in the scrotum at the site of the testicle

o Contralateral testicle

o gynaecomastia

o Abdominal adenopathy or Troisier

- <u>Testicular ultrasound</u> (heterogeneous hypoechoic vascularised tumour, and contralateral testis)

- <u>Serum biological panel</u>

o tumour markers: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), total human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

o if gynaecomastia: estradiol, testosterone

- <u>Extension balance sheet</u>

Injected thoraco-abdomino-pelvic (TAP) scan. This may be performed prior to orchiectomy if there is a strong clinical, biological or ultrasound suspicion of testicular cancer.

if clinical signs: brain MRI, bone scan

- <u>Fertility preservation</u>

Information and systematic proposal on gamete cryopreservation in CECOS before orchiectomy

- <u>Histological positive diagnosis</u>.

enlarged total orchiectomy via the inguinal route with 1st cord ligation

- Percutaneous biopsy is formally contraindicated.

In cases of diagnostic doubt, removal of the tumour by inguinal surgery with extemporaneous examination may be discussed.
