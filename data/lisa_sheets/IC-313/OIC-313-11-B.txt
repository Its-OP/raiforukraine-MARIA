*Higher risk of infertility than in the general population. Only 50% of patients with testicular cancer have a normal concentration of spermatozoa. This hypofertility may be aggravated by treatment (chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, radiotherapy).
*Systematic information on gamete cryopreservation in CECOS.
*At least 1 cryopreservation ideally before orchiectomy (best quality before orchiectomy) and imperatively before chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or radiotherapy.
*Forensic value
*If the sperm count is impaired, an oncoTESE for MAP may be performed at the same time as the orchiectomy.
*Unilateral orchiectomy has no effect on erections if the contralateral testicle is healthy, as serum testosterone levels remain normal.
