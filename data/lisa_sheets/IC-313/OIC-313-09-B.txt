<br />

*A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan is used to look for lymph node (retroperitoneum) or lung metastases.
*Markers are measured before and after orchiectomy for prognostic evaluation and follow-up (taking into account their respective half-lives).
**Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): present in vitelline tumours and embryonal carcinoma. Half-life: 5-7 days
**Total human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG): present in all choriocarcinomas and in 10-20% of seminomas (at low levels). Half-life: 24-36 hours.
**Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): non-specific (cell proliferation, tumour mass, metastatic forms, etc.).
*In case of clinical signs: brain MRI, bone scan.
