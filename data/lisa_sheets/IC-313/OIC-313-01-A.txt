==A/ Main histological classes of testicular tumours (according to WHO classification 2016)==

*Seminomatous and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (germ cells in the epithelium of the seminiferous tubules). Mosaic or mixed tumours (several of the above contingents). 98% of testicular tumours
*Germ cell tumours not derived from germ cell neoplasia "in situ".
**prepubertal teratoma
**Squamous cell cyst (benign)
*Sex cord tumours
**Leydig cell tumours (10% malignant)
**Sertoli cell tumours
*Tumours with a stromal and germinal contingent
**Gonadoblastoma
*haematolymphoid tumours
**B-cell lymphoma, acute leukaemia
*Tumours of the rete testis
*Other: haemangiomas, metastases, etc.

==B/ Two types of germ cell tumour (GCT)==

*Non-seminomatous (NSMT) 40% (embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, yolk sac tumour, post-pubertal teratoma)
*Seminomatous (TGS) 60% (AFU 2022-2024 Cancer Committee recommendations)

==C/ Note: a TGS is always "pure"; a mixed tumour with a seminomatous contingent is classified as a TGNS==.
