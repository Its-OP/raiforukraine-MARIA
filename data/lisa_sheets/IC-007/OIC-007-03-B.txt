Article L 1111-1 of the French Public Health Code states that "the rights granted to users are accompanied by responsibilities designed to guarantee the sustainability of the healthcare system and the principles on which it is based".

The only real obligation for patients is to pay the fees charged by the doctors they have consulted.

There is also an "obligation" to collaborate (obligation to provide information "on the part" of the patient, to comply with treatment, etc.). In fact, article L. 1111-4 of the French Public Health Code states that "any person makes, together with the health professional and taking into account the information and recommendations he provides, decisions concerning his health". Indeed, collaboration is necessary in a relationship of mutual trust.

In addition, the rules governing hospitalisation are also set out in the institutions' internal regulations, such as respect for the rest of other patients, respect for the operation of the department, etc. In practice, patients' duties are simply those of citizens.
