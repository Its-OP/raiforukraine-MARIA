Advance directives were introduced by the Léonetti law (2005) and strengthened by the Claeys-Léonetti law (2016).

*'''The definition:''''

This is a written statement enabling any person of legal age, if they so wish, to specify their wishes regarding the end of their life. These advance directives can help doctors make decisions about the care to be given if the person is no longer able to express his or her wishes. They can be used to make known the patient's wishes regarding the following situations: limiting or stopping current treatment, being transferred to intensive care, being put on artificial respiration, undergoing surgery, being relieved of suffering even if this leads to death, etc.

*'''Collection conditions:''''

You must be of legal age. An adult under guardianship may draw up advance directives with the authorisation of the judge or the family council, if there is one. They must take the form of a written document (handwritten or typed), dated and signed, on plain paper (models exist within certain establishments and the content of the drafting models is defined in article R1111-18 of the Public Health Code). If the person is unable to write, they may call on 2 witnesses, including their trusted support person.

It is important that they are easily accessible. The person concerned must inform their doctor and next of kin of their existence and where they are kept. They may be kept in the shared medical file, if this exists, or in the file of the person's GP. They may also be entrusted to a trusted support person, a close relative or an institution providing care (hospital or institution for the elderly, for example). Finally, they may be kept at the person's home, with an indication of where they are kept.

*'''Conditions of validity:''''

They are valid for an unlimited period, unless the author decides otherwise. They may be amended or cancelled at any time. To modify them, the person may write new ones. The person must ask for the old ones to be deleted. If there are several valid advance directives, the most recent will be taken into account.

*'''Situations in which advance directives should be consulted:''''

Doctors must seek out the existence of advance directives as soon as possible when a patient is no longer able to express his or her wishes. The law of 2 February 2016 makes advance directives mandatory (rather than advisory). Article L. 1111-11 of the French Public Health Code states that "advance directives are binding on the doctor for any decision regarding investigation, intervention or treatment".


<u>However, there are two exceptions in which the practitioner may dispense with it:</u>

- A life-threatening emergency for the time needed to fully assess the situation;

- When the advance directives appear to be inappropriate or inconsistent with the medical situation.
