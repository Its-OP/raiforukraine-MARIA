The 4 suppurative or locoregional complications are :

- Peritonsillar phlegmon: localised suppuration between the tonsil and its lodge. It combines the classic signs of "trismus on examination" with swelling of the soft palate and oedema of the uvula.

- Retropharyngeal abscess: forms behind the pharynx. It is associated with fever, painful dysphagia and dyspnoea. In children, the classic clinical presentation is febrile torticollis.

- adenophlegmon (parapharyngeal abscess): this is the purulent collection of one of the peripheral cervical adenopathies of angina. It is associated with neck pain followed by a "febrile torticollis" and a deterioration in general condition.

- Cervical cellulitis: this is where the bacterial infection spreads to the cervical fat. Clinically, an "extensive inflammatory cervical placard" is observed, sometimes with subcutaneous crepitus.
