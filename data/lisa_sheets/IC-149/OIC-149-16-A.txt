They are always of ''viral'' origin, caused either by ''herpes simplex virus'' or by ''enteroviruses (echovirus and coxsackie)''.

In children under the age of 7, they are usually caused by the Coxsackie A virus, and have a sudden onset, but heal rapidly in 2 to 4 days. Involvement of the extremities can lead to hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome.

In adults, vesicular angina is often associated with marked and very painful gingivostomatitis, usually due to a primary herpes infection (HSV1). Very rarely, a unilateral vesicular sore throat associated with severe pain is suggestive of glosso-pharyngeal herpes zoster.
