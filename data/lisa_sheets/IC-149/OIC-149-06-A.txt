Before the age of 3, the probability of bacterial angina is very low, angina is rare and almost always viral, and no test is indicated.

In the case of erythematous sore throat from the age of 3, it is advisable to perform a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). In clinical evaluation studies, these tests have a specificity of around 95%, while their sensitivity varies from 80 to 98% depending on the culture technique used.

In adults, the Mac Isaac clinical score can be taken into account when deciding not to carry out the RDT test if the score is strictly less than 2. A score of 2 or more means that an RDT is routinely carried out.

The Mac Isaac score takes into account the following 4 criteria:

'''- fever > 38Â°C,''''

'''- presence of exudate,''''

painful cervical adenopathy

'''- absence of cough'''.

Each criterion is worth one point, giving a score ranging from 0 to 4. Mac Isaac suggests ''removing -1 point if > 45 years'', giving a score of -1 to + 4.

A clinical Mac Isaac score < 2 has a negative predictive value of over 95% to rule out strep throat. Patients with a Mac Isaac score of 1 have a maximum probability of GAS infection of 5%. A score of less than (or equal to) 1 in adults means that the test should not be carried out and antibiotics should not be prescribed.

The RDT is performed in the presence of clinical signs of erythematous or erythematopulmonary angina. It consists of ''a 4-step test'': 1) Sampling; 2) Bringing the product into contact with the reagents; 3) Immersion of the test; 4) Reading of the test. '''A positive RDT justifies antibiotic therapy.'''
