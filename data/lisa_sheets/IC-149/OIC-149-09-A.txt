Treatment is based on drug therapy, comfort care and follow-up planning. Hygiene rules are applied, in particular hand washing.

Analgesic treatment is based on paracetamol; NSAIDs and corticoids are not recommended in this indication.

According to the French National Authority for Health (HAS), for angina, regardless of the type of job, "the reference period for time off work is 3 days". The length of time off work can be adapted according to the severity of the symptoms, the patient's age and physical condition, and whether the patient works in a healthcare environment or in contact with vulnerable populations.

The natural history is healing most of the time.
