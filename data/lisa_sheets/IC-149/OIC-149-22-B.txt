Lemierre syndrome is caused by septic jugular thrombophlebitis complicated by pulmonary emboli. The picture may include a "febrile state" and an "altered general condition". Respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, pleuritic pain and haemoptysis are frequently reported. Osteoarticular pain, abdominal pain and jaundice are also not uncommon. Other symptoms are sometimes present, depending on the location of the septic emboli.
