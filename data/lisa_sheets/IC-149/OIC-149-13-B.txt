A haemogram and blood smear examination may show the presence of a mononucleosis syndrome. Other tests may help with the diagnosis: presence of moderate hepatic cytolysis, positive MNI test (not very sensitive in children), positive anti-VCA IgM, etc.

In the case of infectious mononucleosis, treatment is based on the use of analgesics and antipyretics. In severe or complicated cases requiring hospitalisation, corticosteroid therapy may be recommended on specialist advice.
