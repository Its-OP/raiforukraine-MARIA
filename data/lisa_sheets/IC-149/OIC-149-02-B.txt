Angina is a common disease, diagnosed in around 9 million cases in France every year and the subject of numerous antibiotic prescriptions. France is one of Europe's biggest consumers of antibiotics.

Erythematous sore throats account for 80-90% of sore throats, and are most often viral. In the case of bacterial angina, group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) is the germ most often encountered (90% of cases). The risk of GAS angina is highest in children aged between 5 and 15. It is very low before the age of 3 and exceptional after the age of 45.
