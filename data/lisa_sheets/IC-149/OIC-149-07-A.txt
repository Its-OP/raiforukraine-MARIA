Current recommendations are to treat ''erythematous or erythematopulmonary angina'' only if it is ''proven to be GAS''.

As a first-line treatment for acute group A streptococcal angina, in the absence of allergies, it is recommended to prescribe :

- in children aged over 3: ''amoxicillin, 50mg/kg/24h'' taken twice a day for 6 days

- in adults: ''amoxicillin at a dose of 1g*2/d per 24 hours'', 6 days.

In the event of allergies, treatment with cephalosporins or macrolides may be considered.
