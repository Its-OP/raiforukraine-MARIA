The diagnosis is ''clinical''. The clinical picture combines the following symptoms in a variable manner: '''fever, odynophagia, cervical adenopathy, spontaneous constrictive pain in the oropharynx.'''

In half the cases, these signs are accompanied by a cough, rhinorrhea, conjunctivitis or hoarseness, all of which point to a viral origin.

Erythematous" sore throats involve enlarged, erythematous tonsils. Erythematous sore throats involve an enlargement of the inflammatory tonsils, covered with a "pultaceous coating" (whitish, punctiform and non-adherent).
