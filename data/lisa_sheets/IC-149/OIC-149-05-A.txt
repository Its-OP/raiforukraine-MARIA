The germs most frequently implicated are :

- Viruses: between 50% and 90% of cases.'' ''Under the age of three, angina is almost always viral.'' The viruses responsible are: rhinovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, myxovirus influenzae and M. parainfluenzae, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and, more rarely, HIV.


- '''Bacteria:''' '''Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GAS) is by far the most common germ (90% of bacterial angina).'''' Angina caused by gonococci, streptococcus B, C, F and G, the fuso-spirillary association (responsible for Vincent's angina), or anaerobes are possible, but rare.
