'''Communication is important''', some patients request antibiotics ('''patient resistance)'''. According to the World Health Organisation, antibiotic resistance ''constitutes one of the most serious threats'' to global health. Every antibiotic prescription is carefully considered, weighing up the ''short-term benefits'' for the patient against the ''harmful effects'' on commensal flora and bacterial ecology through the selection of multi-resistant bacteria.

In addition, patients are informed of signs pointing to ''a complication: fever > 3 days or recurrence of fever after 3 days, persistence of symptoms beyond 10 days, respiratory discomfort, purulent conjunctivitis, palpebral oedema, skin rash, digestive disorders''. In these very rare cases, it is advisable to call your doctor for a rapid re-evaluation.
