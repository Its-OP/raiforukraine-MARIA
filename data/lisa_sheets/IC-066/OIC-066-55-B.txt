Three trauma-focused psychotherapies are recommended.

- Trauma-focused CBT helps to manage anxiety and combat cognitive or behavioural avoidance, using classic relaxation techniques, graduated exposure to stimuli and cognitive restructuring.

- Prolonged exposure therapy (PET) is a trauma desensitisation technique. The exposure is imaginary and real, progressive, repeated and controlled until the fear is extinguished.  

- Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) aims to dissociate memories of negative emotions by evoking certain elements of the traumatic memory while focusing attention on bilateral visual stimuli.

Peer groups and associations can provide social and legal support.
