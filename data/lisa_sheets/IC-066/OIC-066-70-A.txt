A. A lasting pattern of experience and behaviour which deviates significantly from what is expected in the individual's culture. This deviation is manifest in at least two of the following areas: Cognition (i.e. perception and vision of oneself, others and events). Affectivity (i.e. the diversity, intensity, lability and appropriateness of the emotional response). Interpersonal functioning. Impulse control.

B. These lasting arrangements are rigid and invade a wide variety of personal and social situations.

C. This enduring mode leads to clinically significant suffering or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.

D. This mode is stable and prolonged, and its first signs can be detected no later than adolescence or early adulthood.

E. This picture is not better explained by the manifestations or consequences of another mental disorder.

F. This enduring mode is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g. a drug of abuse or medication) or a non-psychiatric pathology (e.g. a head injury).
