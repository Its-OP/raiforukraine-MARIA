Use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the most severe forms of EDC, with melancholic/catatonic/psychotic features, resistance or contraindication to drug treatment, life-threatening situations (suicidal risk, risk of malnutrition/dehydration). If there is a good response, maintenance ECT is offered for several months to prevent recurrence of depression.

Psychotherapeutic treatments are indicated as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate EDC. They are an important complement to antidepressant medication, particularly in cases of drug resistance.
