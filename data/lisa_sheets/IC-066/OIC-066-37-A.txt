Obsessions: Invasive, recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses and images that the subject feels are intrusive and inappropriate, and a source of anxiety. The subject tries to ignore, neutralise or repress them with other thoughts or actions.

Compulsions: Repeated behaviours or rituals (washing, tidying up, checking) or mental acts (counting, repeating) that the subject is obliged to perform in response to an obsession or in a rigid manner, to neutralise or reduce distress, excessive and without any realistic link to the obsessions.

Most patients are well aware of the pathological nature of their symptoms, which can vary over time and is a prognostic factor.

Three main themes of obsessions and compulsions.

* Contamination: Obsessions with contamination, compulsions, washing rituals, avoidance of touch.
* Error: Obsessions with order and symmetry, associated magical thinking, compulsions and verification rituals, rigidity in the sequence of actions.
* Forbidden thoughts: Obsessions with forbidden catastrophic thoughts, aggressive impulses, sexual content deemed reprehensible, religious, moral or somatic preoccupations. Compulsions and mental rituals, checking.
