The aetiology of GAD involves a number of genetic (anxious temperament, sensitivity to stress) and environmental (occupational stress, other stresses) vulnerability factors.

The aetiology of PD is linked to genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors.

The aetiology of phobic disorders is also multifactorial, involving psychological (low self-esteem and perfectionism in SAD), genetic, neurobiological and environmental factors. Environmental risk factors include traumatic life events, social learning by imitating models (e.g. a phobic parent) or the integration of warning messages (e.g. a pathological anxious parent).
