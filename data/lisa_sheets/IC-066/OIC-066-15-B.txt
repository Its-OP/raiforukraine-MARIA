Hospitalisation is used in cases of high suicidal risk, endangerment, severe DCI, melancholic, psychotic or catatonic features, resistance to medication, complex co-morbidities (anxiety disorder, addiction), or isolation/lack of socio-familial support. Hospitalisation may be on an open care basis or without consent, depending on the patient's consent. It is used to prevent the risk of suicide and any complications arising from prolonged bed rest or nutritional deficiencies.
