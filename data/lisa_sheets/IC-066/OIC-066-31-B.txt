Cognitive-behavioural therapies (CBT) should be favoured (Item 73): strategies focusing on managing emotions and worries in GAD, exposure and desensitisation techniques for physical sensations in PTS, and fearful situations in agoraphobia. Relaxation is important.

In the case of phobias, CBT combines systematic desensitisation or gradual and prolonged voluntary exposure to feared objects/situations, with cognitive restructuring of automatic beliefs and thoughts.

In SAD, group CBT is preferred, with public exposure exercises, role-playing and assertiveness training.
