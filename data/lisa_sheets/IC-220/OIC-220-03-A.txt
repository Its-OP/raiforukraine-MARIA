In the case of any lymphadenopathy, it is essential to ''specify whether it is a single lymphadenopathy or a polyadenopathy'' (involvement of several lymph nodes).

All superficial lymph nodes must be examined (jugulocarotid, submandibular, occipital, supra-clavicular, axillary, epitrochlear or inguinal lymph nodes). The characteristics of any associated adenopathies must be specified (size, consistency, shape, pain, superficial and deep adherence).

You should also look for splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and tonsillar hypertrophy.

The examination will be recorded on a dated diagram specifying the location and size of any anomalies found.
