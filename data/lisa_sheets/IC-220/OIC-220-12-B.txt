After the clinical examination, further tests should be ''guided by the context'' and ''according to the diagnostic orientation''.

No further examination is necessary in the context of a common ENT viral infection.

Examination to be discussed outside this context:

- haemogram: look for neutrophil polynucleosis, cytopenia, circulating tumour cells, mononucleosis syndrome

- CRP if inflammatory/infectious aetiology

- LDH if tumour or haemopathy suspected

- '''IDR tuberculine selon l'orientation'''

- '''Serologies''' EBV, CMV, toxoplasmosis: in the case of polyadenopathies without orientation or depending on the context

- '''Bartonella henselae serology''' in cases of suspected cat scratch disease, or single adenopathy without referral

- Loco-regional ultrasound of the site of the adenopathy

- '''Cytopuncture of lymph nodes''' to be discussed (diagnostic orientation and/or documentation)

- Chest X-ray: to look for enlargement of the mediastinum or infection

- Abdominal ultrasound: search for a tumour syndrome


Lymph node biopsy is less routine in paediatric patients and should rarely be performed as a first-line procedure.
