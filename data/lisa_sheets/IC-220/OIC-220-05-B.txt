'''A- In the presence of isolated adenopathy'''

Priority should be given to looking for damage to the drainage area. The main causes are as follows.

1) Local infection

Especially if fever and inflammatory adenopathy. Always look for an infectious route of entry (wound, bite, scratch).

The main causes to look for are

- Cat scratch disease: post-scratching (or even licking involving the mucous membranes)

- Tularemia: contact with game

- Sexually transmitted infections in inguinal adenopathy: syphilis, chancroid, Nicolas and Favre disease

- Tuberculosis (often "cold" lymphadenopathy, which may be large)

- Toxoplasmosis


2) Solid tumour

Depending on the area of drainage. (Caution: breast, lung, mediastinum and abdomino-pelvic tumour in the case of left supra-clavicular adenopathy - Troisier lymph node).

Don't forget to look for melanoma in the corresponding area of the skin, even though melanoma can metastasise to lymph nodes outside the drainage area.


'''3) Lymphoma'''

To be eliminated especially if the disease has progressed for more than 4 to 6 weeks, with B symptoms (weight loss, sweating, fever): Hodgkin's disease, Burkitt's lymphoma, anaplastic lymphomas are the most frequent entities in children. Note that lymphoma adenopathies may fluctuate in size over the course of the disease (Hodgkin's disease) and may also be inflammatory (anaplastic lymphoma).


4) Rare causes

- Castelman's disease

- Chronic Granulomatosis

- Whipple's disease

- Histiocytosis

- other


B- In case of polyadenopathy

1) Malignant haemopathy

- Lymphoma: particularly if chronic and with B symptoms

- Acute leukaemia: cytopenias and associated signs, circulating blasts on blood count


'''2) Infection''''

- HIV

- CMV

- Toxoplasmosis

- Tuberculosis

- Infectious mononucleosis

- Secondary syphilis

- Brucellosis

- Visceral leishmaniasis


3) Inflammatory pathology

- Sarcoidosis

- Lupus

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Kawasaki syndrome in children

- Still's disease


4) Other

- Drug toxicity (hydantoin)

- Histiocytosis

- Rare causes: macrophagic activation syndrome, chronic granulomatosis, overload disease, drug toxicity, severe eczema, severe prurigo, other
