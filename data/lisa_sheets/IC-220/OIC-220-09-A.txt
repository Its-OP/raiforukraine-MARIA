'''Cytopuncture of lymph nodes'''

'''Cytopuncture''''' is a procedure that is '''easy''' to perform, gives a '''rapid''' result (a few hours) and enables a '''microbiological study'' to be carried out. It is also often used to find lymphoma cells or Sternberg cells (Hodgkin's lymphoma) in cases of specific involvement.

It is a useful test for ''rapid orientation''. It may require ultrasound guidance if the lymph node cannot be palpated, or if a lymph node or part of a lymph node needs to be targeted.

However, a normal cytopsy ''does not rule out lymphoma'', and a lymph node biopsy is always necessary to confirm lymphoma and specify its histological type, even if lymphoma cells are found on cytopsy.

lymph node biopsy

Lymph node biopsy ''requires prior organisation'', and can be carried out under general anaesthetic (if deep) or local anaesthetic, increasingly by radio-guided biopsy (bearing in mind that the material brought back is smaller and may require biopsy-exeresis at a later stage if the diagnosis is uncertain).

It enables a ''histological study'' to be carried out, as well as ''immunohistochemistry'', ''molecular biology'' and a ''karyotype''. This is the only test that allows histological classification of lymphoma (>70 different entities in the WHO classification)''. The tumour tissue removed must be ''frozen''. This procedure ''must be carried out by a specialised team'' to ensure that the material is transported in the conditions required for the various examinations (some of it in a fresh state).

''A lymph node biopsy is essential for any chronic adenopathy (> 3-4 weeks) in adults to rule out tumour pathology''.

It is performed as a second-line treatment in children in the absence of a clear referral:

- If isolated adenopathy: < 1-2 cm: monitoring

                                                                              > 1-2 cm: if inflammatory: trial treatment with antibiotics or lymph node puncture

                                                                                                             if painless: puncture or even biopsy (GA)
