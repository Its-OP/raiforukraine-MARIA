Biological tests will be '''guided by the general context and orientations according to the clinical examination and the context.'''

- Haemogram: almost systematic, looking for inflammatory anaemia, mononucleosis syndrome, neutrophilic polynucleosis, abnormal circulating cells and cytopenias.

- Viral and parasitic serologies to be adapted to the clinical situation

- CRP if inflammatory or bacterial orientation

- LDH if there is a strong suspicion of lymphoma or acute leukaemia

- '''Autoimmune test''' if non-infectious inflammatory referral/context

- lymph node cytopuncture: to be discussed for rapid referral (see form) or microbiological sampling

- Lymph node biopsy for chronic adenopathy in adults
