Adenopathy is frequently found in children.

Most frequently, adenopathies are discovered in the context of a common infection, particularly an ENT infection, in the case of the anterior cervical lymph nodes: the lymph nodes are small <10mm, flexible and not attached to the underlying surface.

Generally speaking, the "infectious context" is the most frequent:

- In the case of isolated adenopathy: local infection of the drainage area, inoculation pathology, other...), or lymphangitis.

- In cases of polyadenopathy: viral infections (EBV, CMV, etc.), parasitic infections, or infections caused by atypical bacteria.

The presence of an isolated cold adenopathy with a more chronic course (>2 months) should give rise to fears of a tumour etiology (leukaemia, lymphoma, other).

An "inflammatory context" (fever, aphthosis, arthralgia, bone pain, skin or digestive signs, hepatosplenomegaly) should prompt a search for rarer causes (granulomatosis, systemic inflammatory diseases).

Adenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly may also be found in the context of "overload disease".

Finally, adenopathy can also be associated with drug toxicity.
