'''Depending on the context''', the following investigations may be discussed:

- Ultrasound of lymph nodes: if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of adenopathy

- Abdominal ultrasound: to look for deep abdominal adenopathy, hepatomegaly or splenomegaly in cases of clinical difficulty (obesity), and to look for solid tumours.

- Chest X-ray: to look for damage to the lung parenchyma and mediastinal adenopathy (infection? tuberculosis? cancer?)

- CT scan centred on the drainage area of the adenopathy'' in the case of isolated adenopathy (to look for a deep local tumour or infection). If there is a left supra-clavicular lymph node, an abdominal and pelvic examination should be carried out.

- ''Cervical and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with injection'' : in lymphoma extension work-up looking for other adenopathies - solid cancer extension work-up according to histology

- '''Positron emission tomography (PET) 18-FDG scan''' : extension assessment of a lymphoma or solid tumour according to histological type
