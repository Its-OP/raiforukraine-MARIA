The ''diagnosis of adenopathy is clinical'', with the presence of an acquired swelling greater than 1 cm in size in one of the superficial lymph node territories. The main differential diagnoses will be other causes of local swelling. Depending on location:

- Benign tumours (e.g. lipoma) or malignant tumours (e.g. sarcoma), particularly in the cervical region

- Parotid tumour

- A ''tumour of the submaxillary gland''.

- A ''thyroid tumour'' (mobile to decontamination)

- Congenital cysts (especially cervical)

- Hidrosadenitis (in the sudoriparous zone, mainly axillary)

- An ''arterial vascular aneurysm'' (pulsatile)

- Inguinal or crural hernia

''If there is any doubt on clinical examination (always palpate and auscultate the swelling), an ultrasound scan may be discussed'' to clarify the nature of the swelling. Any swelling in a lymph node is not an adenopathy.
