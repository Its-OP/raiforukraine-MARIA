'''The effects of ionising radiation depend on:'''

* The nature of the radiation
* The dose in Gy
* The dose rate (i.e. the rate at which a dose is delivered to a tissue)
* The volume irradiated
* The nature of the tissue contained in this volume

'''Essential difference between deterministic and stochastic effects'''

- '''Deterministic effects''' :

o Occurrence of medium (100 to 1000 mGy) or high (> 1000 mGy) doses

o Occurrence threshold specific to each effect/tissue (below the threshold, the effect does not occur, above, the effect affects 100% of individuals, the severity increasing with the dose and dose rate).

o Early effects, with clinical signs appearing within a few minutes to a few weeks, which may lead to late sequelae.

- '''Stochastic effects''' :

o Random occurrence, responsible for a higher incidence of cancer (no genetic effects)

o Frequency increases with dose, dose-independent severity

o Late onset (several years)

o Difficult to demonstrate at low doses (< 100 mSv). Consequently, in radiation protection of workers, the so-called Linear Relationship without Threshold (RLSS) is applied. From a medical point of view (particularly for patient radiation protection), this risk is considered insignificant below 100 mSv.
