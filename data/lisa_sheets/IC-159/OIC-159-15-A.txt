'''Summary''': '''Any patient presenting with tuberculosis disease with pulmonary involvement must be hospitalised in a single room with additional air precautions. Contacts of patients with tuberculosis should be treated by the tuberculosis control centre (CLAT).'''

[Management of a patient with bacilliferous tuberculosis SD-274|Management of a patient with bacilliferous tuberculosis]]: Complementary respiratory precautions of the "air" type:

* a single room with the door closed, ideally under negative pressure, otherwise with regular ventilation by opening the windows
* FFP2 masks must be worn by carers when entering the room,
* patients wearing surgical-type masks when moving around outside their rooms (limited to a maximum).
* Isolation maintained for the first 14 (7 to 21) days of treatment or until direct examination of respiratory samples is negative for bacilliferous patients.

[Consultation following a tuberculosis infection SD-301|Consultation following a tuberculosis infection]] :

Adult contacts of a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis are managed by the CLAT: immediate chest X-ray to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis disease; if this is normal, the patient is seen again two months later with a TST or IGRA test to detect LTI, which will justify treatment.

Screening of exposed children is very important, as early detection and treatment of latent infections can prevent progression to TB disease. The first assessment should take place ''less than 2 weeks'' after the diagnosis of the index case.

In children under 5 years of age, the 1<sup>rst</sup> assessment includes a clinical examination, TST or IGRA test, and chest X-ray. If there are no signs of infection (normal X-ray and negative immunoassay), a further check should be carried out 8 to 12 weeks after the last contact. During this period, children under the age of 2 should be offered prophylaxis (isoniazid and rifampicin). For children over 5 years of age, the procedures are identical to those for adults.
