'''Summary''' : '''BCG vaccination is no longer compulsory, but remains strongly recommended for children at high risk of tuberculosis'''

BCG is a live, attenuated vaccine which is injected intradermally. It mainly protects against miliary forms of tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis.

It is only recommended for children at high risk of tuberculosis:

* children born in a highly endemic country,
* children of parents born in a highly endemic country,
* children expected to spend more than one month in one of these countries,
* a family history of tuberculosis,
* children living in ÃŽle-de-France or French Guiana
* any other situation deemed risky by the doctor.

Vaccination should be carried out from the age of 1 month, ideally during the 2nd month, and can be co-administered with the other vaccines scheduled for this age.

Neonatal vaccination, before leaving the maternity hospital, is still recommended for children from French Guiana or Mayotte, or who have a family member with recent tuberculosis (less than 5 years old).

Children at risk who have not been vaccinated can be vaccinated up to the age of 15.
