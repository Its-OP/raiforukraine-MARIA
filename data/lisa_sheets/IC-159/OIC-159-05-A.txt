'''Summary: indirect diagnostic tools, they measure the delayed hypersensitivity immune response to mycobacteria, without distinguishing LTI from tuberculosis disease'''.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma assay (IGRA) are indicated for screening for LTBI in populations at high risk of infection and/or at high risk of progression to TB disease: a positive test after a previously negative test indicates a diagnosis of LTBI. In children, these tests also contribute to the diagnosis of TB disease, for which microbiological proof is rarely obtained.

Indications for testing for LTI :

- close contact case of contagious tuberculosis (during a case investigation)

- migrants under the age of 18

- HIV-positive patient

- before starting immunosuppressive treatment (antiTNFα, transplant)

- professionally exposed personnel

Tests can also help with diagnosis in: difficult cases of tuberculosis disease in children (paucibacillary forms), cases of suspected extra-pulmonary TB, etc.

Intradermal tuberculin test (IDR)

Reading at 72 hours, after intradermal injection of non-specific mycobacterial antigens, with measurement of induration caused by tuberculin and not redness. This induration is due to the influx of cell-mediated immunity cells in response to the injection of mycobacterial antigens. In the context of an LTI-risk situation, the induration thresholds that should lead to a diagnosis of LTI in immunocompetent individuals are ''15 mm'' in the case of previous BCG vaccination and ''10 mm'' in the absence of BCG vaccination.

Interferon-gamma detection tests (IGRA)

Measurement of gamma interferon production by the subject's lymphocytes in response to specific M. tuberculosis antigens. Two tests are available: Quantiferon®-TB Gold in-tube and T-SPOT.TB®. They are easy to perform: one blood test, one visit. They can be used at any age.
