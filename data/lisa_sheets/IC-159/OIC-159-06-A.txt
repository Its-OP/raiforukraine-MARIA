'''Summary: the body's first contact with a mycobacterium, usually asymptomatic.'''

Primary tuberculosis infection is the result of the body's first contact with a mycobacterium of the tuberculosis complex. It is usually latent, meaning that there are no clinical or radiological signs, and only immunological tests are positive.

The disease may also progress to the appearance of radiological signs and symptoms. This progression to full-blown disease is particularly common in young children and immunocompromised individuals. It can occur very rapidly, in the weeks following infection, and lead to disseminated forms (miliary or meningitis).
