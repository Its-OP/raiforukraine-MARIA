'''Summary: 5 risk factors to remember: undernutrition, precariousness, coming from an endemic area, immunodepression, extreme ages.''''

The [[Denutrition/malnutrition SD-030|denutrition]]: a low ''<u>body mass index (BMI)</u>'' is associated with an increased risk of acquiring tuberculosis

Precariousness ([[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|precarious social situation and isolation]]) and more generally unfavourable socio-economic conditions (poverty, prison environment, etc.) due to promiscuity and difficulty in accessing care.

Coming from an endemic area: patients from Africa, South-East Asia, Central Asia, South America, Central and Eastern Europe are particularly at risk of developing TB disease on arrival in the country, with the added potential risk of multi-drug resistance depending on their country of origin.

Immunosuppression :

- <u>''iatrogenic:''</u> anti-TNFÎ± biotherapies, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, ...

- <u>''infectious:''</u> HIV/AIDS (to be sought systematically),

- <u>''neoplastic:''</u> cancer <u>''solid or''</u> haemopathies

- Extreme ages: children under 5 years of age, particularly under 2 (immature immune system) and the elderly (immunosenescence).
