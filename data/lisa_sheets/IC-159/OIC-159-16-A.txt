'''Summary: Tuberculosis is a notifiable disease.'''

Tuberculosis is a notifiable disease:

*immediate notification by name to the ARS medical inspector in the event of a diagnosis of tuberculosis disease, for operational purposes (forwarded by the ARS to the corresponding CLAT for investigation)
*anonymous notification at the start of treatment, supplemented by an anonymous declaration at the end of treatment (12 months after the initial declaration)
*mandatory reporting of latent tuberculosis infections in children under 15 years of age

It enables the investigation of a case (nominative declaration) and the epidemiological monitoring of tuberculosis in France (resistance/loss of sight). It is partly thanks to this system, in conjunction with the CLAT, that the incidence of tuberculosis has fallen in France.

Please note: tuberculosis is covered at 100% by social security as an ALD.
