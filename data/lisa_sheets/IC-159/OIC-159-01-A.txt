'''Summary: Due to differing socio-economic levels and migratory flows, tuberculosis is unevenly distributed throughout the world and in France'''.

In 2019, there will be an estimated 10 million cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths (of which around 15% will be children). It is the 1<sup>rst</sup> cause of death in the world due to a single infectious agent, ahead of AIDS. There is great geographical disparity: Africa and southern Asia account for two-thirds of the world's cases of tuberculosis.

In France, a country considered to have a low incidence of tuberculosis, there are also regional disparities, with regions such as Ile de France, Mayotte and French Guiana having an incidence 2 to 7 times higher than the national average.
