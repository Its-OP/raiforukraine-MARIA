'''Summary''' : '''Airborne disease caused by mycobacteria of the ''tuberculosis'' complex, the predominant pathogenic species of which is ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'' stricto sensu or Koch's bacillus (BK).''''

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a slow-growing, strict aerobic acid-fast bacillus (AFB) (growth time: approximately 2-3 weeks) which is transmitted by aerosolisation of infectious particles emitted by a patient with tuberculosis disease.

Bacilliferous tuberculosis occurs when BAARs are found on direct microscopic examination of respiratory samples, indicating a particularly contagious form.

As mycobacteria of the tuberculosis complex are strict pathogens, their presence in a diagnostic sample is always pathological and means that the patient is ill.
