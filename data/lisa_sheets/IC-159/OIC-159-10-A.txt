'''Summary: Imaging in adults and adolescents looks for vertex involvement. Chest X-rays are less sensitive than CT scans. Tuberculosis disease in children is characterised by intra-thoracic adenopathy and compression of adjacent airways (atelectasis or trapping).'''

Chest X-ray remains the simplest examination but is less sensitive than injection-free chest CT. Imaging identifies preferential involvement of the upper lobes''<u>, or apical segments of the lower lobes,</u>'' in the form of infiltrates that are sometimes excavated, one or more isolated nodules, one or more caverns.

Chest X-rays involve negligible radiation, and scans without injections involve little radiation (low-radiation scans). In children, an injection of contrast medium is necessary for good visualisation of adenopathies.''

[Identify/recognise the different imaging examinations (type/window/sequences/incidences/injection) SD-233|Identify/recognise the different imaging examinations (type/window/sequences/incidences/injection)]]: ''in standard radiography we speak of opacity, in CT of density (hypo/hyper). We look for pulmonary lesions in the parenchymal window and adenomegaly in the mediastinal window.
