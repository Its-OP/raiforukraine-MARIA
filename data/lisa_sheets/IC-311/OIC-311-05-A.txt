==Imaging tests useful for diagnosing kidney tumours==

*Renal ultrasound
**Used to differentiate between solid masses and cysts
**Operator dependent
**Non-irradiating
**A diagnostic test but insufficient to make a therapeutic decision.
**Useful for active surveillance of a renal mass (size assessment)
**Heterogeneous cortical image (hyper and hypoechoic)

*Abdominal and pelvic CT scan without and with injection of contrast medium.
**Reference examination +++ with 3 phases (+/- 4)
***without injection
***with injection with acquisition of cortical nephrography, tubular nephrography (the late excretory phase is not systematic)
**Distinguishes typical masses (angiomyolipoma, renal cell carcinoma, cyst)
**Performs an extension assessment of the mass if malignant (peri-renal fat, veins, adjacent organs).
**Assessment of the condition of the contralateral kidney

*'''Renal MRI''''
**Useful in cases where CT is contraindicated (impaired renal function, allergy to contrast products).
**Additional information in the case of equivocal CT scans
**Particularly useful in cystic tumours and to assess the level of tumour thrombus in the veins.

*Renal contrast ultrasonography (under evaluation)
**Principle: intravenous injection of a product which generates micro-bubbles that are clearly visible on ultrasound.
**Useful for examining vascularisation (to distinguish a dense cyst from a solid mass)
**Additional information in the event of an equivocal CT scan

==Radiological criteria for a malignant tumour (on a CT scan)==

*Solid cortical tumour sometimes heterogeneous with enhancement > 15 HU compared to time without injection
*heterogeneous
*Intratumoral necrosis, intratumoral calcifications
*Retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy
*Extra-renal extension (peri-renal fat, adjacent organs)
*Thrombus in veins (renal vein or extension to vena cava)

==Indication of renal mass biopsy==

*'''General principle of indication:''''
**Biopsy may change the way the disease is managed.
*'''Objective:'''
**Formal diagnosis: malignant versus benign tumour
**Risk assessment in the case of malignant tumour: histological type, ISUP grade, etc.
*Indications related to the tumour (disease):''''
**Before treatment with active surveillance or ablative treatment (radiofrequency, cryotherapy)
**Before systemic treatment (anti-angiogenic/immunotherapy) in the case of metastatic tumour if there is no histological evidence.
**Before difficult partial nephrectomy with a high risk of total nephrectomy
**Uncertainty on imaging (doubt about benignity)
**Context of another extra-renal tumour
*Indications related to the patient's condition (medico-legal risk):''''
**Elderly patient with comorbidities
**Chronic renal failure/single kidney (indication for nephron preservation imperative, partial nephrectomy imperative)
*Biopsies not recommended in cases of:''''
**suspected urothelial carcinoma (risk of seeding)
**Cystic tumour
**Typical angiomyolipoma
**Congenital or acquired coagulation anomalies or major haemorrhage risk.

==Biological tests useful in the case of kidney tumours=

*There is no specific biological marker for kidney cancer.
*Assessment of renal function: plasma creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and 24-hour proteinuria.
*NFS
**haemoglobin (anaemia: impact in the event of haematuria or polycythaemia: paraneoplastic syndrome)
**Neutrophil count (if elevated is a poor prognostic marker in metastatic forms)
**Platelet count (if low is a poor prognostic marker in metastatic forms)
*
*In the case of a metastatic tumour, measurements should also be taken:
Blood glucose (if elevated is a poor prognostic marker in metastatic forms) **LDH (if elevated is a poor prognostic marker in metastatic forms)
**HDL (if elevated is a poor prognosis marker in metastatic forms)
**Liver work-up
**Complete blood count
**protein and albumin levels
**Alkaline phosphatase

==Extension work-up in the case of malignant tumour of the kidney===

*'''Assessment of locoregional extension:''''
**Abdominal and pelvic CT scan without and with injection of contrast medium

*'''Remote extension assessment:''''
**thoracic CT scan
**If clinically indicated (not routinely performed): bone scan, brain CT scan
