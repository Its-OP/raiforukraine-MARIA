Mental health is a "major public health issue" (see Item 60):

Psychiatric disorders often begin in young adults, develop chronically and cause disability (see Item 121).

According to the WHO, psychiatric disorders are the leading contributor to the global burden of non-communicable diseases, ahead of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

'''Psychiatry in France in figures:''' frequent disorders and major consequences :

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Annual prevalence in adults and children: 20%.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>12 to 15% of disabilities (= cardiovascular diseases; > cancers)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 30% of life days lost through preventable mortality or disability (WHO)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> active psychiatric file (in 2020) = 2.0 million adults; 430,000 children and adolescents

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 15,000 psychiatrists

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 23 beds/100,000 inhabitants in 2022

<nowiki>*</nowiki> a very high cost: â‚¬107 billion, or 3 to 4% of GDP (direct costs and indirect costs: loss of quality of life, work and productivity for patients and families)

The public health objectives in mental health are to ensure :

<nowiki>*</nowiki> a ''continuity'' and a ''permanence'' of care ;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> a '''fight against psychiatric disorders'' (including addictive disorders): prevention, screening, diagnosis, care, psycho-social rehabilitation to facilitate the patient's integration and retention in the community (see Items 60 and 121) ;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> a fight against inequality of access to care; it should be noted that there is a wide disparity in provision across the territory(ies);

<nowiki>*</nowiki> a fight against the ''''stigma'''' associated with mental disorders and psychiatric disability (see Item 121);

<nowiki>*</nowiki> the '''promotion of patients''' rights and care (see Item 59).
