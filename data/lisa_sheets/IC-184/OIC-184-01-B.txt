*Sickness (sickness, maternity, invalidity, death);
*the family branch (including disability and housing...);
*pensions (old age and widowhood).

'''At national level'''

Occupational injury insurance is managed by the PR department within the occupational injury branch of the Caisse Nationale de l'Assurance Maladie des Travailleurs Salariés (CNAMTS), which is separate from the health branch.

'''At regional level'''

16 regional health insurance funds (CARSAT) implement the RP prevention policy and the pricing of company contributions.

'''At local level'''

129 primary health insurance funds (CPAM), manages compensation for victims of occupational injuries.


Be aware that there are other insurance schemes (MSA, civil service, EDF-GDF, SNCF, RATP, etc.) than the social security system and that self-employed workers or volunteers are not compulsorily insured against the risk of occupational accidents and diseases.
