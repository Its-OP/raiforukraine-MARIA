A commuting accident is defined as an accident that occurs ''during the outward and return journey'' between :

* his main or secondary ''residence'' and the ''place of work'' ;
* the workplace and the restaurant, canteen or, more generally, the place where the employee usually eats.

Commuting accidents also benefit from a ''presumption of imputability''.
