Between medication and surgery, ''laser trabeculoplasty'' involves selective photocoagulation of the iridocorneal angle, resulting in retraction of the trabecular tissue and facilitating the outflow of aqueous humour.

Surgery is essentially based on subconjunctival fistulisation of the aqueous humour. After making a conjunctival incision, a lamellar scleral flap is made, enabling Schlemm's canal to be approached externally. The outer wall of Schlemm's canal is then resected (deep sclerectomy) or a full-thickness resection is performed down to the anterior chamber (trabeculectomy), allowing excess aqueous humour to drain into the subconjunctival space.
