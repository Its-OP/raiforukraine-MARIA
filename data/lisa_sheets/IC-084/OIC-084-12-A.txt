Acute angle closure crisis (AACC) is symptomatic, with eye pain and reduced visual acuity. It is treated as an ophthalmological emergency. If left untreated, an acute glaucoma attack can lead to total and permanent loss of vision within a few hours as a result of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve.

The "functional" signs are noisy:

- very deep pain, radiating into the trigeminal area

- often associated with nausea or vomiting

- reduced visual acuity, which depends on corneal oedema secondary to major hypertonia

The examination reveals the following signs:

- the eye is red

- the transparency of the cornea is diffusely reduced by corneal oedema due to major ocular hypertonia

- the pupil is in areflex semi-mydriasis

- the anterior chamber is narrow, the iridocorneal angle is closed

- major ocular hypertonia (up to 70 mmHg)

- The other eye should be examined systematically, as it usually has the same anatomical predisposition.
