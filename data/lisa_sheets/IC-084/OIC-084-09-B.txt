Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in Western countries (after age-related macular degeneration [AMD]) and the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma is therefore a major public health problem, requiring systematic screening of the population over the age of 40. Screening is based on measuring intra-ocular pressure and examining the papilla at the back of the eye. If there is the slightest doubt, the visual field should be recorded using perimetry.
