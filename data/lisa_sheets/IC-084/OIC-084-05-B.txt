In primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), intraocular pressure (IOP) is generally high (70 to 80% of cases of POAG in the West), but sometimes within normal limits. This is known as "normal pressure OOPD": the IOP is normal throughout the day, and the damage is linked to circulatory problems in the optic nerve head. The diagnosis is based on the other clinical signs: papillary excavation and visual field alterations.
