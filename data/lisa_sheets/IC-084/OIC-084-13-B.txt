The risk of an acute angle closure attack (CAFA) increases with age, and is higher in women and when the

the eyeball is small (hypermetropic subjects).

CAFA arrives:

-on predisposing factors leading to a constitutional narrowing of the iridocorneal angle:

- hyperopia

- narrow anterior chamber

- narrow iridocorneal angle

- large lens

- on '''triggering''' factors in circumstances leading to physiological mydriasis (darkness, stress, physical exercise) or pharmacological mydriasis (pupillary dilation for a fundus examination, or all pharmacological agents that can dilate the pupil, for example certain antihistamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics, vasoconstrictors, antiparkinsonians, anticholinergics, etc.).

The attack is due to pupillary blockage. Mydriasis causes the anterior surface of the lens and the posterior surface of the iris to come together through 360Â°. The aqueous humour can no longer pass and accumulates in the posterior chamber, pushing the root of the iris forward and leading to trabecular blockage. The aqueous humour can no longer be excreted from the eye, leading to a rapid and very high increase in intraocular pressure.
