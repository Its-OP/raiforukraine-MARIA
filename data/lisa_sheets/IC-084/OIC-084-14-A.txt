Treatment is an emergency and often requires hospitalisation. If left untreated, the condition can progress rapidly, sometimes within a few hours, to permanent loss of vision in the eye. As the predisposing factors are generally bilateral, the pupil of the other eye must not be dilated for the examination, as this could provoke a contralateral attack.
