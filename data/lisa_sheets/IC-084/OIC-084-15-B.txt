This is a ''therapeutic emergency'' requiring hospitalisation in ophthalmology and the insertion of a peripheral venous line.

IOP is rapidly reduced by the administration of IOP-reducing eye drops, combined with systemic administration of agents that cause dehydration of the eyeball (acetazolamide [Diamox®] IV or orally, and mannitol IV). After this treatment, a myotic eye drop is used to bring the pupil back to miosis and facilitate the outflow of aqueous humour from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber (pilocarpine eye drop).

The general treatment therefore includes :

- carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the absence of contraindication (allergy to sulphonamides, severe renal insufficiency, severe hepatic insufficiency, history of renal colic): acetazolamide (Diamox®) intravenously and potassium supplementation.

- hyperosmolar solutions in the absence of contraindication (20% mannitol, contraindication: cardiac insufficiency, renal insufficiency)

- hypotonising eye drops

- myotic eye drops (pilocarpine) instilled every hour (also in the other eye as a preventive measure).

Treatment is monitored by means of blood ionograms, blood sugar levels, urea levels, creatinine levels, liver function tests and electroencephalograms (EEGs).

Once the attack has been brought under control, eye tone has returned to normal and the cornea is clear, a "peripheral iridotomy" must be performed to prevent another episode. This involves making a small hole in the periphery of the iris, which short-circuits the pupillary passage of the aqueous humour. This treatment is performed using the YAG laser. It is systematically carried out on both eyes.

If laser treatment fails, the iridectomy will be performed surgically.

Once the iridectomy has been performed, there is no longer any contraindication to medication.
