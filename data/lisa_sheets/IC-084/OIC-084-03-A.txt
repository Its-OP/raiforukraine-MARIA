The pathophysiological mechanisms of optic neuropathy in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are not yet fully understood. However, a number of factors associated with a high risk of developing glaucoma have been clearly identified:

- Age: the prevalence of CAPM is less than 0.5% between the ages of 40 and 50, rising to around 10% after the age of 85;

- ocular hypertonia: an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than two standard deviations (2.5 mmHg per standard deviation) from the statistically normal value (15.5 mmHg) is a risk factor but not the cause of POAG;

- family history: a direct family history confers a 3-fold increased risk of developing GPAO in offspring. Genes have been identified but their research has no clinical application for the moment;

- ethnicity: melanoderma patients, mainly black people of African origin, have a 3 times higher risk of developing GPAO than other ethnic groups;

- myopia: myopia of any degree triples the risk of developing GPAO.

Other risk factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease have been described, but with much less evidence than those listed above.
