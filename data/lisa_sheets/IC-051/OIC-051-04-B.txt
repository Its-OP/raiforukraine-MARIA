==In the case of mictional disorders, look for associated disorders such as:==

*Psychological problems in children: urination problems can lead to withdrawal, emotional stress and a loss of self-esteem. Children with voiding problems may also suffer from developmental and learning difficulties.
*Psychiatric problems: children with micturition problems have 2 to 4 times more behavioural problems, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
*Sleep disorders such as sleep apnoea and parasomnias, particularly in children with enuresis.
*Nocturnal respiratory disorders: upper airway obstruction (snoring), especially if accompanied by obstructive apnoea, is frequently reported in isolated primary enuresis.
