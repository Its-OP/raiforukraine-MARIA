==Distinguish between:==

*Enuresis is primary: if the child has never had a period of continence during sleep of at least six months.
*Enuresis is secondary: if enuresis appears after 6 months of mictional control.
*Primary enuresis is isolated or mono-symptomatic if there are no other symptoms, particularly diurnal (urgency, pollakiuria, dysuria, etc.), affecting the lower urinary tract.
*Isolated primary enuresis may be polyuric due to inversion of the ADH cycle. In this case, nocturnal urine volume is greater than daytime volume, with lower urine osmolarity at night.
*Isolated primary enuresis may have low bladder capacity, defined as a functional bladder capacity, assessed on a 48-hour voiding schedule, of less than 70% of theoretical bladder capacity.

<br />

*The positive diagnosis of primary enuresis is above all clinical. It is based on questioning and physical examination.
*No imaging test is necessary as a first-line diagnosis.
*The degree of severity of enuresis must be assessed (one night per month, more than one night per week, every night).
*A family history exists in 30 to 60% of cases.
*20% of children suffering from ADHD have associated primary enuresis and 10% of enuretics suffer from ADHD. This comorbidity should be investigated.
