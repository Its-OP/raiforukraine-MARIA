*The diagnostic approach first eliminates what is not a [[Micturition disorders and urinary incontinence in adults and the elderly|micturition disorder 125]] and then looks for secondary micturition disorders before making the diagnosis of primary micturition disorders.
*In the majority of cases, voiding problems exist in the absence of an anatomical or neurological cause, and are referred to as primary voiding problems. Sometimes bladder dysfunction is secondary to [[Urinary tract infections in children and adults|urinary tract infection 161]], constipation, inadequate hydration, irritation of the [[Genital-scrotal pathology in boys and men|external genital organs 50]], etc. The association between constipation and micturition problems is frequent.
*Isolated primary enuresis (involuntary and unconscious urination) is a disorder that occurs exclusively during sleep without any daytime problems.

<br />

*However, some bladder weaknesses are not mictional disorders:
**Permanent, drip incontinence due to ectopic abruption of the urinary tract.
**Loss of urine after normal micturition, suggesting vaginal micturition in girls, encouraged by "tight thighs" or coalescence of the labia minora. In boys it may be sub-preputial micturition (ballooning of the prepuce secondary to [[Genito-scrotal pathology in boys and men|tight phimosis 50]]).
**Behavioural pollakiuria, which is a "tic" behavioural disorder with 20 to 30 micturitions per day without leakage or dysuria, in response to psychosocial or emotional problems, or excessive consumption of acidic drinks (orange juice, apple juice, etc.) or drinks rich in oxalate (tea, iced tea).
