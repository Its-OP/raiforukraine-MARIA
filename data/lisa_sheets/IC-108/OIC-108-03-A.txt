Neurological causes :

- Meningeal haemorrhage.

- Meningitis and meningoencephalitis (bacterial, viral, parasitic [neuromalaria] and prion).

- Intracranial expansive processes (tumours, brain abscesses, haematomas).

- Head trauma (subdural, extradural and intraparenchymal haematomas).

- Cerebral infarcts (located in the brain stem, basal ganglia and large infarcts).

- Generalised epilepsy (post-critical phase or non-convulsive malignant state).

In fact, confusion can occur in the course of any chronic neurological pathology (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) in the presence of physical stress (see Understanding the main non-neurological causes of mental confusion). The underlying neurological pathology is then more of a risk factor than the cause of the confusion.
