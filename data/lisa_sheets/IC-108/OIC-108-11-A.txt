Non-drug treatment of AD is not specific to AD and can be applied to other neurocognitive disorders, with the aim of :

- Stabilise or compensate for the neurocognitive disorder

- Avoid social withdrawal and a lack of physical and cognitive stimulation

- Supporting families, who are often exhausted.

Stabilisation or compensation of the neurocognitive disorder :

- Language and cognitive re-education (or remediation) sessions with a ''speech therapist'' ('''[[Prescription for re-education SDD-247|prescription for re-education]]''') ;

- Cognitive rehabilitation sessions (aimed at maintaining or restoring autonomy for certain tasks) by a ''specialised Alzheimer's team (ESA)'' made up of psychomotricians, occupational therapists and gerontology care assistants (on prescription), mild to moderate stage ('''[[Prescription for rehabilitation SDD-247|prescription for rehabilitation]]''');

- Cognitive stimulation in a day centre (medical), on registration

Human assistance, third party intervention :

- Logistical support for carers: home help (home helps, care assistants); the day centre also provides support for carers.

- In the event of loss of autonomy, in complex cases (single subject refusing care), possible recourse to systems called ''MAIA'' for the integration of assistance and care services in the field of autonomy '''([[Refusal of recommended treatment and care SDD-343|refusal of recommended treatment and care]])''' ;

- Institutionalisation when it is impossible to remain at home: a nursing home or long-stay care facility.

Financial and medico-legal assistance :

*Long-term illness (ALD-15) and 100% reimbursement (at the dementia stage);
*Financial support: allocation personnalisée d'autonomie (APA), subject to income and degree of loss of autonomy, if aged ≥60, Prestation de Compensation du Handicap (PCH) if aged <60;
*Medico legal protection measures such as legal protection, guardianship or family guardianship if necessary (not systematic).

Help for carers '''([[Global support for a carer SDD-330|global support for a carer]])''' :

- support and respite platforms (psychological support, training for carers)

- family associations.

Lifestyle and other treatments :

- Daily physical activity (walking, for example) ;

- Daily outings ;

- Monitoring of nutritional status (unbalanced diet, forgotten meals, '''[[Swallowing disorders or false swallowing SDD-062|swallowing disorders or false swallowing]]''' and hypermetabolism linked to AD which can lead to '''[[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]], [[Denutrition/malnutrition SDD-030|denutrition/malnutrition]]''';

- Treatment of sensory deficiencies (''''[[Vision abnormality SD-138|vision abnormality]], [[Decreased hearing/deafness SDD-140|decreased hearing/deafness]]''''), aggravating cognitive and social interaction difficulties;

- Treatment of curable aggravating factors (anaemia, cardiac insufficiency, antehypophyseal insufficiency, etc.) ('''[[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-267|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]])''''';

- Prevention of '''iatrogenia''' (stopping non-essential psychotropic drugs, especially hidden psychotropic drugs, and especially anticholinergic drugs [e.g. bladder antispasmodics]) ('''[[Geriatric follow-up consultation SD-295|geriatric follow-up consultation]] ; [[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]] ; [[Follow-up consultation with a patient suffering from polymedication SD-266|follow-up consultation with a patient suffering from polymedication]]; [[Voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug SDD-340|voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug]])''''
