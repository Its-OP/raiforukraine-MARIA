Indications '''([[Request for an imaging test SDD-231|request for an imaging test]])''' for perfusion scintigraphy or FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) in neurocognitive disorders: all '''forms of difficult diagnosis''' :

- patients seen in the early stages of minor TNC

- atypical clinical profile

- early-onset dementia.

Hypoperfusion identified by perfusion scintigraphy and hypometabolism demonstrated by FDG-PET have the same topography:

- in Alzheimer's disease: hypoperfusion/hypometabolism of the associative and medial temporal cortical regions (see item 132 positive diagnosis of AD)

- in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD): hypoperfusion/hypometabolism in the frontal, anterior temporal and/or cingulate regions (see item 132 question Frontotemporal lobar degeneration)

Indication '''([[Request for an imaging examination SDD-231|request for an imaging examination]])''' of Dopamine transporter scintigraphy in neurocognitive disorders: diagnostic hesitation between diffuse Lewy body disease (pathological examination showing dopaminergic denervation of the striatum) and Alzheimer's disease (normal examination). (cf item 132 question Lewy body disease)
