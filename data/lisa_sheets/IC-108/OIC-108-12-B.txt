There are "four main sets of cognitive functions". Depending on the type of function affected, it is possible to establish an approximate topography of the regions affected (topographical diagnosis), which contributes to the diagnosis of the underlying neurocognitive disorder (aetiological diagnosis).

'''Attention'''

- Depends on cortical alertness and arousal systems: there is a continuum between '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''', '''[[Mental Confusion/Disorientation SD-119|mental Confusion/Disorientation]]''' (which result from severe '''[[Attention Disorder SDD-129|attention Disorder]]''') and '''[[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and Consciousness Disorder]]'''''

- Attention is necessary for all the major intellectual functions: the degree of attentional impairment must be checked before exploring or interpreting a cognitive disorder.

- Tests by repeating a long sentence, carrying out complex instructions, giving the months of the year or days of the week backwards.

'''Perceptual integration functions'''

- Carried by the posterior cortical regions, these are the functions of identification, recognition and comprehension of language, gestures, space, sound or visual objects and the body schema.

- They are located downstream of the perceptual functions (auditory cortex in the temporal lobe, visual cortex in the occipital lobe), and essentially result from damage to the temporal and parietal lobes.

- '''Temporal lobe involvement:'''

o '''Aphasia''' ('''[[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language and/or phonation disorders]]''') by impairment of comprehension, '''visual agnosia''' (failure to identify and represent simple visual objects (colours or shapes) or more complex ones (faces, manufactured or living objects)

o Tests understanding of simple commands ("close your eyes"), naming of objects or faces.

- '''Parietal lobe involvement:'''

o '''Apraxia''' (failure to perform movements in the absence of a deficit in sensitivity or basic motor skills), '''visual neglect''' '''unilateral''', i.e. inattention to the contralateral visual field (in the absence of an amputation of the visual field), '''disturbance of the representation of the body schema'' (difficulty in naming body parts, indistinctness between the left and right sides, etc).

o Tested by copying a geometric figure (MMSE image), drawing a flower or house without copying, clock test, imitating arbitrary gestures, symbolic gestures ("military salute", "nose-thumbing") and gestures involving the use of objects ("brushing teeth", "combing hair", "playing the violin", "hammering a nail").

'''Memory'''

- Corresponds to several very distinct systems (episodic, semantic, procedural memory, etc.) but in the tests, ''episodic memory'' is mainly assessed.

- '''Episodic memory''' :

o the ability to transform an event experienced by oneself into a lasting memory and to retrieve it at a later date; its formation and retrieval are always associated with the context of the event experienced (i.e. the place, the moment, the emotional state)

o the critical phase of recording information in memory (also known as storage or "consolidation")

o depends on the medial part of the temporal lobes (T5), in particular the ''hippocampi'' and adjacent cortices.

o Damage to both hippocampi results in anterograde amnesia, leading to "progressive forgetting" ("What did I do two minutes ago, an hour ago, the day before, a week ago?").

- Five-word test: very useful for determining whether memory damage affects consolidation or not.

o 1. read five words ("Museum", "Lemonade", "Colander", "Grasshopper" and "Truck") aloud and then have them read a second time, starting by asking the taxonomic category of the word ("What is the drink?"...).

o 2. Immediately afterwards, have the pupils repeat the five words (immediate recall).

o 3. After an interval of 3 minutes (busy with another non-verbal task, e.g. a drawing task), ask for the five words again. If the patient cannot recall the words, he is given the taxonomic category of the word. If the index does not allow the words to be recalled, this is probably a consolidation disorder.

'''Executive functions'''

- Mental operations enabling the individual to '''understand the context'' of the action, to d''''inhibit automatic or reflexive behaviour'' and to '''generate voluntary behaviour'' directed towards a goal.

- Depend on a vast cerebral network, but the most critical regions are the frontal lobes and basal ganglia.

- '''Dysexecutive syndrome''' leads to a lack of contextualisation (difficulty in social adaptation, loss of empathy, impaired judgement and reasoning), a release of automatic behaviours (repetitive and stereotyped ''[<nowiki/>[[Obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour SDD-136|obsessive disorders, compulsive behaviour]]]''') and reflexive or archaic in dependence on the immediate environment (urinary control disorder, adherence to the environment, rush to food ''[<nowiki/>[[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SDD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]]''', disinhibition, etc.) and a failure to develop and initiate voluntary action (lack of planning, apathy).

- Tested using the ''rapid frontal efficiency battery'' (BREF)
