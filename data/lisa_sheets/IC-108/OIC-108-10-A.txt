The main differential diagnoses of AD are :

- '''Mental confusion''' '''([[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]])''' (cf. definition and diagnosis of mental confusion items 108, 342)

o Beware! confusion may be a means of discovering dementia or may occur during the course of dementia: always look for AD or another dementia at a distance from a confusional episode.

- Functional causes of cognitive impairment

o Depression '''([[Sad mood/moral pain SDD-123|sad mood/moral pain]])''', chronic anxiety '''([[Anxiety SDD-116|anxiety]])''', (cf. item 66 Diagnose: depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder (from children to the elderly), personality disorder), use of psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, hypnotics, etc.) (cf. item 74. Prescribe a treatment for chronic anxiety).) (cf. item 74. Prescription and monitoring of psychotropic drugs), sleep disorders (insomnia and sleep apnoea) '''([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SDD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia]])''' (cf. item 110. Sleep disorders in children and adults)

o May lead to attention and executive function problems affecting memory function ("pseudo-amnesia" marked above all by encoding and retrieval problems).

o Beware! depression and anxiety can be associated with AD: suggest trial treatment with antidepressants and reassess cognition at a later stage.

- '''Organic causes'''

o "Secondary" and possibly curable dementia

§ Hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency, syphilis, HIV, certain brain tumours (frontal meningiomas).

§ Chronic adult hydrocephalus (formerly known as "normal pressure" hydrocephalus) (see item 109. Gait and balance disorders and cf. item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic adult hydrocephalus) : leads to '''disorders''' of walking (with small steps) and '''of balance ([[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]], [[Fall in the elderly SDD-027|fall in the elderly]])''', frontal-type cognitive disorders with apathy ('''[[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]'''), and urinary control disorders ('''[[Urinary incontinence SD-103|urinary incontinence]]'''); A diagnostic and therapeutic test consists of performing evacuating lumbar punctures; surgical treatment by ventriculoperitoneal shunt is proposed when the diagnostic probability is high.

§ Subdural haematoma (cf item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma): a frequent cause of cognitive disorders (psychomotor slowing, apathy, frontal syndrome, mental confusion, etc.) in the elderly, often detected at a distance from a head injury, even a mild one, or even unnoticed, subdural haematoma is favoured by dehydration, chronic alcoholism and treatments affecting coagulation.

§ Post-traumatic encephalopathy

§ Alcohol-related cognitive disorders (alcoholic dementia) (see item 76 alcohol addiction)

§ Vascular encephalopathy or vascular dementia (see item 132 question Positive diagnosis - Vascular encephalopathy)

o '''Subacute encephalopathies''' (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, inflammatory or autoimmune encephalitis, including paraneoplastic syndromes), if the dementia syndrome progresses rapidly (<1 year).

o '''Other degenerative dementias'''

§ Frontotemporal dementia (or frontotemporal lobar degeneration, FTLD)'' (see item 132 question Frontotemporal lobar degeneration)

§ Diffuse Lewy body disease (see item 132 question Lewy body disease)
