'''Memory complaints are by far the most common symptom leading to the diagnosis of AD''. It is a form of ''forgetfulness as you go along'' (for example, the patient repeats the same thing several times), reflecting an inability to form a lasting memory from an event experienced '''([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]])'''. It is not uncommon for the patient to minimise the complaint (anosognosia), while the family and friends are concerned about it''([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]]).''''

On neuropsychological assessment, the most characteristic memory impairment in AD is "episodic memory consolidation disorder". In the typical form of AD, episodic memory disorders predominate over other cognitive impairments, even in more advanced disease.

In verbal episodic memory tests (consisting of learning a list of words), the consolidation disorder is characterised by :

- no encoding difficulties (the patient can immediately recall the list of words)

- a collapse in the ability to recall words on a delayed basis (after a delay of a few minutes and an intercurrent cognitive challenge)

- above all, the absence or weakness of the help provided by category clues (example of a clue, for the word "truck": "what was the vehicle?"), with clues often causing "intrusions" (the patient evoking words that were not part of the original list); the absence of help from the clue distinguishes the consolidation disorder from a recovery disorder where the clue is sufficient to make the patient restore the missing words.

Consolidation disorder can be suspected by means of the "five-word test", a simple test of verbal episodic memory that can be suggested in a medical consultation. It is proven by neuropsychological assessment by a neuropsychologist, using tests such as the 16-item "free recall/indexed recall".

This profile of memory impairment :

- as opposed to other types of memory deficits secondary to attention or executive function disorders, which impair the quality of encoding or retrieval of information (but not directly consolidation), as is the case in depression or anxiety, sleep disorders, excessive use of psychotropic drugs (see item 108 Knowing the main differential diagnoses of AD and item 132 Differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders).

- results from damage to the Papez circuit, and in particular to hippocampal structures (cf item 108 Specify the principles of topographical reasoning when faced with a dementia syndrome)

- is a good clinical argument in favour of AD (see item 132 Positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease)

- is not essential for diagnosis (there are atypical forms of AD)

- is not pathognomonic (it can be observed in related diseases): additional clinical and paraclinical evidence is required to make the diagnosis of AD.
