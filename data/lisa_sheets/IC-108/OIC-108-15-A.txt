</gallery>Injection-free CT scan showing a peri-cerebral collection in the left hemispheric convexity (arrows), mostly hypo-dense, in the shape of a "crescent moon" (concave medially and convex laterally): chronic subdural haematoma. Note the additional presence of a few spontaneously hyper-dense areas within the chronic subdural haematoma, indicating the presence of a recent rebleed.
