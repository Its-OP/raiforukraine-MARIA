Imaging '''is not routinely recommended in confusion (mental confusion/disorientation)''', but a CT scan or (depending on the hypotheses and availability of tests) a cerebral MRI should be requested '''as a matter of urgency at the slightest suspicion'' of an underlying neurological lesion '''([[Request for an imaging test SDD-231|request for an imaging test]])'''' :

- In the event of focal signs on neurological examination

- If there is a recent history of head trauma or anticoagulant treatment (subdural or parenchymal haematoma) (see item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma).

- Before any lumbar puncture in cases of suspected meningoencephalitis (item 151. Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children)

- If confusion has set in suddenly (suspected stroke item 340).

Outside the context of confusion, a ''cerebral MRI'' is essential for diagnosing a neurocognitive disorder and therefore Alzheimer's disease. In the event of contraindication, a cerebral CT scan will be performed '''([[Request for an imaging examination SDD-231|request for an imaging examination]])'''. The objectives are :

- rule out a non-degenerative cause, looking in particular for :

o an intracranial expansive process (intra- or extracerebral tumour, subdural haematoma, etc.)''([[Discovery of a brain anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain anomaly on medical imaging examination]])'' (cf item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma)

o hydrocephalus (see item 109. Gait and balance disorders and cf. item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic hydrocephalus in adults )

o ischaemic and haemorrhagic vascular lesions (useful sequences: T2/FLAIR and T2 gradient echo, respectively): it is particularly for analysing vascular lesions that MRI is far superior to CT (see item 132 question Positive diagnosis - Vascular encephalopathy).

- look for cerebral atrophy

o assess the presence of cortical or subcortical atrophy and its topography (frontal, anterior cingulate and anterior temporal as in frontotemporal lobar degeneration [see item 132 question Frontotemporal lobar degeneration], posterior or global as in Alzheimer's disease)

o visually assess hippocampal atrophy (useful sequence: coronal T1 with a slice plane perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus), using the Scheltens hippocampal atrophy assessment scale (subjective measure which depends on the clinician's experience).
