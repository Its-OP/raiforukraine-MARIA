Chronic adult hydrocephalus '''([[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-226|discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination]])''' :

- Abnormalities visible on brain scan or MRI.

- Tetraventricular dilatation.

- Absence of mass effect as opposed to obstructive hydrocephalus linked to the presence of an identified obstacle to CSF flow.

- Suffusion of fluid into the periventricular parenchyma (''transependymal resorption'') leading to radiological abnormalities of the periventricular white matter (hypodensity on CT or T2-weighted hypersignal on MRI).
