Overall rehabilitation objectives :

* Reduction of deficiencies with possible recovery in many situations through :
** Anatomical recovery (joint amplitude, muscle strength, etc.)
** Functional recovery (motricity, deconditioning to exertion)

* Reduction of the consequences of deficiencies, activity limitations and restrictions on participation: improvement or restoration of function by introducing compensation or possible appliances.
** Maintenance, when a programme of self-exercise alone is not sufficient to maintain functional capacity ('''[[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]], [[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SD-276|Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]], [[Progressive loss of autonomy SD-031|Progressive loss of autonomy]], [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|Assessment and management of chronic pain]])'''''
