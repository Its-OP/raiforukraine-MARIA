A request for an assessment is a prerequisite for a speech therapy prescription, with 2 possible types ('''[[Prescription of a rehabilitation SD-247|Prescription of a rehabilitation]], [[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|Drafting a prescription/medical letter]])''' :

* a speech and language assessment with re-education if necessary: once the assessment has been sent to the prescriber, the speech and language therapist draws up a request for prior agreement if re-education is necessary.
* an investigative speech and language therapy assessment: once the assessment has been sent to the prescriber, who may or may not decide to prescribe speech and language therapy.
