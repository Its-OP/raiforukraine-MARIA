*Interest of 18-lead ECG in case of suspected acute coronary syndrome.

*Arterial territories: ''anteroseptal'' (V1 to V3), ''apical'' (V4), ''low lateral'' (V5-V6), ''high lateral'' (DI, aVL), ''inferior'' (DII, DIII, aVF), ''right branches'' (V3R-V4R) and ''posterior'' (V7 to V9).

*Acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation:
**Positive T waves'', symmetrical and wide in the very early stages,
**ST segment elevation'', convex upwards, in an arterial territory (at least 2 contiguous leads) > 1 mm in the frontal/peripheral leads and > 2 mm in the precordial leads (Pardee wave),
**Mirror'' in opposite territories (ST segment sub-shift),
**Appearance of "Q waves of necrosis" in the absence of early revascularisation (at least 1/3 of the QRS in amplitude and > 40 ms), and later of negative T waves. R waves may be planed rather than necrotic Q waves, particularly in the anterior territory,
**Persistence of a remote offset in the case of ventricular aneurysm formation,
**Non-interpretable changes in the presence of a complete left bundle branch block or in the case of ventricular pacing by a pacemaker,
**In isolated posterior MI, misleading 12-lead ECG with large exclusive R waves in V1 to V3, sometimes isolated. Posterior leads are useful for confirming the diagnosis.

*Non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome'' :
**''ST segment sub-shift'', horizontal or descending, in an arterial territory (at least 2 contiguous leads),
**Sometimes changes limited to T waves (symmetrical and wide positive or negative),
**ECG sometimes normal, particularly if post-critical. A normal ECG does not rule out the diagnosis.
