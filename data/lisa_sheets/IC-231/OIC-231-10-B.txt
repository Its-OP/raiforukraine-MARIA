*We do not talk about BAV 1 or 2 in a patient with atrial arrhythmia, but we can observe variable PR intervals on decremental conduction (Wenckebach periods).
*Depending on the atrial arrhythmia, conduction may be 1:1, 2:1, 3:1 etc. and often with variable conduction resulting in irregular ventricular contraction (Wenckebach's periods).
*In the case of a complete BAV associated with an atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, flutter etc...) the ventricular rhythm will be regular in the presence of an escape, without being a multiple of the atrial activity if this is organised.
