ECG abnormalities corresponding to short-term life-threatening situations:

* Rhythm disorders (ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointes, supraventricular arrhythmias with rapid ventricular rate: Super-Wolff (atrial fibrillation with ventricular pre-excitation), accelerated nodal conduction (1/1 atrial flutter).
* Bradycardias (asystole, high-grade atrioventricular block, sinus dysfunction)

Differential diagnosis: electromechanical dissociation (cardiac arrest without rhythm disorders), for example secondary to a poorly tolerated pericardial effusion (tamponade).

* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): ST-segment elevation ACS, non-ST-segment elevation ACS.
* Main intoxications and hydro-electrolytic disorders: Major QT interval prolongation, Hypo/hyperkalaemia, Hypercalcaemia, Drug intoxications.
