*Vagal manoeuvres or injections of adenosine can temporarily slow or even block conduction in the VAD
*The main physical manoeuvres are sino-carotid massage and the Valsalva manoeuvre (closed expiration with closed glottis).
*The effect of vagal manoeuvres or adenosine on the various tachycardias can be summed up simply:
**Transient slowing of a ''sinus tachycardia'',
**Reduction of junctional tachycardia,
**Slowing of atrioventricular conduction, allowing F waves of flutter or P waves of atrial tachycardia to be detected,
**No effect on ventricular tachycardia.
