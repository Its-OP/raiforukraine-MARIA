* ''Long-term ECG'', usually 24 hours but up to several weeks,
* Most often 2-3 leads, but 12-lead Holter possible,
* Indicated for ''malaise/syncope or palpitations'' not documented on standard ECGs,
* Can also be used to monitor/search for :
** Average heart rate in patients on bradycardia drugs,
** Rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation,
** The presence of atrial or ventricular rhythm disorders, even in the absence of symptoms,
** Calculation of the QT interval without using the correction formulae (at 60bpm).
* If the symptoms are too infrequent to be recorded, external or implantable event recorders can be used (with a lifespan of around 3 years).
