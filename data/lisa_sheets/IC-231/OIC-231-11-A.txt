- Sinus dysfunction: bradycardia not adapted to physiological needs.

- '''Sinus bradycardia''' < 60 bpm or pauses > 3 seconds

- Multiple causes, often degenerative in the elderly

- Not all bradycardia corresponds to sinus dysfunction (physiological bradycardia)

- In young people, this is most often due to vagal hypertonia, particularly in athletes,

- Exclude a secondary cause: iatrogenic (bradycardiac drugs), metabolic (hyperkalaemia), endocrine (hypothyroidism), etc.

- The ''different types of sino-atrial block'' (SAB):

* BSA type 1: prolongation of conduction time in the sinoatrial junction. Not visible Appears as simple sinus bradycardia on ECG

* BSA type 2:
** 1st degree: progressive lengthening of the PP delay until the disappearance of a P wave. The pause is less than twice the previous PP delay,
** 2nd degree: disappearance of a P wave without prior lengthening of the PP delay. The pause is then equal to twice the atrial cycle,

* BSA type 3:
** no sinus activity,
** junctional or ventricular escape rhythm.
