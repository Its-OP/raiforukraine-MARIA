*''Brady-tachy syndrome or atrial disease'': Alternating episodes of atrial arrhythmia and sinus dysfunction.
*''Post reduction pauses'': Sinus pauses are frequently observed during the reduction of episodes of atrial arrhythmia.
*'''Chronotropic insufficiency''': inability of the heart to accelerate heart rate to meet the increased physiological demands of exercise; during exercise, heart rate<75% FMT (maximum theoretical frequency = 220 - age).
*Carotid sinus syndrome'': bradycardia (sinus dysfunction, BAV) triggered by mechanical stimulation of the carotid sinus (RRmax>3s) (post reduction pauses).
*'''Sinus bradycardia''' due to vagal hypertonia
*Often in young athletes, sinus bradycardia < 50 bpm when awake and up to 30 bpm during sleep, asymptomatic. Acceleration on exertion or after administration of atropine. No indication for treatment.
