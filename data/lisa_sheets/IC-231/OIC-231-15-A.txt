'''Common flutter''' :

*Atrial arrhythmia which rotates in the right atrium around the tricuspid annulus in a counter-clockwise direction at around 300 bpm,
*Often 2/1 conduction with ventricular rate at 150 bpm, but variable conduction possible, particularly if bradycardia treatment is given,
*Characteristic sawtooth or factory roof F waves positive in V1 and negative in the inferior leads.

'''Atypical flutters:'''

*Most often in patients with a history of cardiac surgery or atrial fibrillation ablation,
*Multiple possible circuits (right or left atrium) around scarred areas with different morphologies,
*Surface ECG appearance different from common flutter. Exact circuit to be specified during specialised examinations (mapping).
