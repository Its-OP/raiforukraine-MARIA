'''BAV 1''' :
- PR > 200 ms.

'''BAV 2 Mobitz 1 (Luciani-Wenckebach):'''
- Progressive prolongation of the PR followed by a blocked P wave,
- Most often nodal block.

'''BAV 2 Mobitz 2 :'''
- Blocked P wave not preceded by progressive PR lengthening
- Unstable PR and RR intervals
- Most often infra-nodal block (Hissian or infra-Hissian).

'''BAV 2 for 1 (2/1):'''
- 1 P wave blocked out of 2,
- Stable PR interval for driven P waves,
- Constant PR and RR intervals when BAV is installed.
- May correspond to a Mobitz 1 or 2. To differentiate, the patient can be asked to make an effort: worsening of BAV in Mobitz 2 (infra-nodal block) or improvement in Mobitz 1 (nodal block).

'''BAV 3 (complete):'''
- Atrioventricular dissociation, no conducted P waves
- Unstable PR interval; constant RR interval when escape is stable,
- Inconsistent escape :
o Junctional (QRS identical to sinus QRS so fine QRS unless associated bundle branch block),
o Ventricular (wide QRS different from the sinus rhythm originating from a ventricular focus of escape).
