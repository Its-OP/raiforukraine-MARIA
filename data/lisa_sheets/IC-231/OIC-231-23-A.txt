The ''corrected QT'' (QTc) is considered prolonged when it is > 440ms, but the diagnosis of congenital long QT syndrome is accepted when the QTc is â‰¥ 480 ms in the absence of a favouring factor.

'''QT interval measurement''' :

*From the start of the QRS to the end of the T wave (intersection between the tangent of the T wave and the isoelectric line),
*To be measured where the T wave is clearly visible (often at DII or V5),
*The QT varies according to the heart rate; Bazett's formula is the most commonly used to correct the QT.
