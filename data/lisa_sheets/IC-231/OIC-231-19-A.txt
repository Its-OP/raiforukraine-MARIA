*Any tachycardia with wide QRS (> 120 ms) is a ''ventricular tachycardia'' until proven otherwise,
*However, ''supraventricular tachycardia may also present with wide QRS'' in the case of bundle branch block or ventricular pre-excitation (accessory pathway).

2 pathognomonic signs in favour of ventricular tachycardia:

*Atrio-ventricular dissociation'' (fewer P waves than QRS complexes),
*''Capture or fusion complexes'': the capture complex is a fine QRS related to a P wave which leads to the ventricles during ventricular tachycardia. The fusion complex is a fusion between a fine QRS resulting from the conduction of a P wave to the ventricles and the wide QRS complex of ventricular tachycardia with an intermediate width,

It is worth carrying out "long ECGs" to look for these signs,

'''Other criteria''' in favour of ventricular tachycardia :

*QRS > 160 ms,
*Exclusive R wave in RV,
*Positive concordance (exclusive R) or negative concordance (QS aspect) in precordial leads,

Ventricular tachycardia is referred to as ''non-sustained'' if < 30 seconds or ''sustained'' if > 30 seconds or poorly tolerated.
