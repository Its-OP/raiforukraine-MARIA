*The term Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is used in patients with ventricular pre-excitation (anterograde accessory pathway also known as Kent bundle) associated with symptoms (palpitations),
*The "accessory pathway" can lead in both directions or only in anterograde or retrograde (hidden accessory pathway),
*On the ECG in sinus rhythm, ventricular pre-excitation can be seen in the case of an anterograde accessory pathway with short PR (<120ms) and delta wave,
*Risk of junctional tachycardia with a circuit that descends via the NVA and ascends via an accessory pathway (most frequent, fine QRS, referred to as "orthodromic tachycardia") or a circuit that descends via an accessory pathway and ascends via the NVA (wide QRS, referred to as "antidromic tachycardia"),
*P waves at a distance from the QRS (>80 ms),
*Risk of sudden death in patients with an accessory pathway with rapid anterograde conduction and transition to atrial fibrillation (super-Wolff).
