* Most reliable sign = ''Sokolow index SV1 or V2 + RV5 or V6 > 35 mm'',
* If there is significant LVH, there are negative T waves laterally (DI, aVL, V5, V6) and sometimes a left axial deviation,
* Not applicable in cases of anterior necrosis,
* Systolic and diastolic LVH: historically, a distinction was made between systolic LVH (hypertension, aortic stenosis) with negative T waves and diastolic LVH with positive T waves (e.g. aortic insufficiency).
