'''Differential diagnoses''': sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, junctional tachycardia (reciprocal on accessory pathway or by intra-nodal reentry).

'''Arguments in favour of sinus tachycardia''' :

* Progressive start and end (advantage of prolonged recordings or continuous monitoring) with fluctuating heart rate,

* Sinus tachycardia in response to a triggering factor or underlying cause (physical exertion, stress, sepsis, hypovolaemia, anaemia, pulmonary embolism, etc.),

* P wave morphology in favour of a sinus node origin:
** Positive in the inferior leads, in DI, and from V3 to V6,
** Negative in avR,
** Often biphasic in V1 (sometimes in V2).

'''Arguments for another etiology''' :

* Atrial fibrillation: irregular rhythm, baseline tremor with no visible P wave,
* Atrial flutter'': flutter F waves with conduction usually 2/1 or variable conduction,
* Atrial tachycardia": P wave different from the sinus P wave with conduction in 1/1, 2/1, etc. or variable conduction. In contrast to flutter, return to the isoelectric line between 2 P' waves.
* Junctional tachycardia'': regular tachycardia with abrupt onset and termination with A/V ratio of 1 and retrograde P' waves (negative in the inferior leads) after the QRS. Retrograde P' waves "stuck" to the QRS (sometimes not visible) more in favour of intra-nodal reentry and P' waves further from the QRS (>80 ms) more in favour of reciprocal tachycardia on accessory pathway (Kent bundle, Wolff-Parkinson-White).
