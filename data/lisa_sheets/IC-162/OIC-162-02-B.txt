'''Gonococcal disease:''' increasing incidence

- Men +++/ women

- Higher in Ile-de-France


'''Chlamydia:''' more common than gonorrhoea.

- Leading cause of bacterial STIs in industrialised countries (prevalence up to 10%).

- First identified cause of acute urethritis

- Peak incidence 15-34 in women and 20-39 in men

- High frequency of asymptomatic carriage


'''Syphilis:'''

- On the rise since 2000 in France and other industrialised countries,

- Male homosexuals +++ in metropolitan France, 40% of patients are infected with HIV

- Heterosexuals +++ in overseas departments and regions (risk of congenital syphilis)


'''HPV infection:''' Most frequent STI, increasing in developed countries (in 16-25 year olds +++)

- Nearly 40% of young European women are infected with HPV

- Worldwide prevalence of latent infections: 25% of under-25s.


Trichomoniasis Low in France for several years, similar prevalence in women and men.
