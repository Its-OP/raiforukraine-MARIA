'''For all STIs, you need:'''

Identify the infected or contaminating partner(s) and offer screening, diagnosis and/or probabilistic treatment from the outset;

Systematically offer :

- HIV serology,

- Treponemal test,

- hepatitis B serology

- Urinary or genital PCR for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis

- Pharyngeal and anal PCR according to sexual practices

Emphasise the risks of recontamination (education).

Consider PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) type treatment against HIV if you take risks too regularly

Protect sexual relations by using condoms, and in particular recommend abstinence/protected sexual relations until contagiousness has disappeared (at least 7 days).

Preventive vaccination for HPV, hepatitis B (and hepatitis A in men who have sex with men)

In the case of urethritis, probabilistic treatment with Doxycycline 200mg/D for 7 days + Ceftriaxone 1g in a single dose may be proposed.

In the case of a chancre, probabilistic treatment with Benzathine penicillin G DU IM 2.4 million units may be proposed.

Systematic re-evaluation of clinical/biological efficacy
