=== - Treponemal tests (TT): specific reaction for treponematoses === - ELISA: automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IgM and IgG levels
- ELISA: automatic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, IgM and IgG levels

- TPHA is a manual agglutination and fluorescence test; result expressed in dilution

- Kinetics: TT + between 7<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> day of canker.

=== - Non-treponemal tests (NTT): VDRL and RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin) are not specific reactions for treponematoses (+++). ===


- TT- and TNT-: no or very recent treponaematosis (or cured and treated early)

- TT+ and TNT+: interpretation according to TNT kinetics (onset of syphilis with increase in TNT, treated syphilis with decrease in TNT)

- TT- and TNT+: false positive

- TT+ and TNT-: cured or very early treponematosis or very old tertiary syphilis
