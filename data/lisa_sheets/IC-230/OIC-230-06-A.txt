'''Know the diagnostic approach to the 4 cardiovascular emergencies'''

- Anamnesis: suggestive background (cardiovascular risk factors, cancer, high blood pressure), characteristics of the pain (location, irradiation, length of time, circumstances of onset, trinitro-sensitive or not, aggravating or analgesic circumstances, link with exercise).

- specific features of the clinical examination (''cardiopulmonary auscultation abnormalities'', presence or absence of peripheral pulses, blood pressure, jugular turgidity)

- look for signs of shock/vital distress

- '''ECG performance and interpretation'''

- followed by a biological and imaging work-up based on the previous observations
