'''Know the place of echocardiography, TEE and thoracic CT in the diagnosis of aortic dissection'''

* Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE):
** Simple examination, available urgently at the patient's bedside.
** Can diagnose aortic dissection (flap in the aorta, dilatation of the ascending aorta), complications (haemopericardium, aortic insufficiency) or differential diagnoses (ACS with kinetic problems, acute pulmonary heart in PE) => 1st intention in haemodynamically unstable patients.

* Thoracic angioscan:''''
** Examination of choice for positive diagnosis,
** Pre-operative extension assessment (visualisation of false duct, portal of entry).
** In stabilised patients.

* '''Trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE):'''
** can complement TEE in an unstable patient.
** Caution: if aortic dissection is suspected, TEE should be performed under anaesthetic cover, ideally in the operating theatre (to avoid a blood pressure spike during TEE while the patient is awake, which is very risky in this context).
