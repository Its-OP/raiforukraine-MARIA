'''To know the place and the anomalies of the thoracic radiography of the 4 cardiovascular emergencies:'''

* Chest X-ray is routinely performed in the presence of chest pain.
* Not necessary in typical ACS (for diagnostic purposes)
* Helps in the diagnosis of the 3 other emergencies (but not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis), enables differential diagnoses to be made (pneumothorax, pneumopathy).

PR abnormalities '''(request for an imaging test)''':

* in aortic dissection: possible widening of the mediastinum, double aortic contour (cf fig)

* in pulmonary embolism: often normal, pulmonary hyperclarity, ascension of a diaphragmatic cupola, atelectasis in bands

* in pericarditis with tamponade: cardiomegaly with heart in decanter
