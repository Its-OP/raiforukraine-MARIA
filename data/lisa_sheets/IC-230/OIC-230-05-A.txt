'''Clinical, functional and physical semiology of aortic dissection'''

- functional clinical signs: sudden, intense chest pain (like tearing or stabbing), typically migratory (transfixing in the back, towards the lumbar region).

Sometimes: faintness/loss of consciousness (syncope), neurological disorders (obnubilation, aphasia, sensory-motor disorders)

- physical symptoms: asymmetric blood pressure (difference >20 mmHg)++, abolition of one or more pulses (radial, femoral, popliteal), murmur of aortic insufficiency, neurological deficit
