==''Know the electrocardiographic abnormalities of the 4 cardiovascular emergencies'''==
Acute abnormalities are located on the ST segment and the T wave. They are associated with a myocardial territory (V1-V4: anteroseptoapical; DII, DIII, aVF: inferior; DI, aVL: high lateral and V5, V6: low lateral; V3R, V4R: right ventricle; V7 to V9: posterior). Classically, a distinction is made between two types

*For '''acute coronary syndrome with ST-segment elevation:''''
**ST elevation ≥ 2 mm in precordial and ≥ 1 mm in inferior and high lateral),
**in at least 2 contiguous leads of the same coronary territory.
**Usually associated mirror sub-shift.
**A new left bundle branch block is considered equivalent to ST+ if associated with a suggestive acute presentation.

*For acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation (i.e. without persistent ST-segment elevation of more than 20 minutes):
**may show ST-segment sub-shift (more reliable if horizontal or descending, see ECG 2),
**negative T waves (see ECG 3)
**or a normal ECG, particularly when post-critical.

*for aortic dissection: ECG generally normal but may be ST+ if dissection extends to a coronary artery

*For pulmonary embolism: (see ECG 4):
**sinus tachycardia (>100/min),
**S1Q3 appearance (S wave in DI and Q in DIII),
**right bundle branch block,
**negativation of T waves from V1 to V3 or even V4.
**NB = ECG abnormalities may be absent.

* for pericarditis with tamponade
** diffuse ST segment elevation (not systematised to a coronary territory) and concave upward ST segment elevation, without mirror, without Q wave,
** sub-shift of the PQ then progression to diffuse negativation of the T waves
** and finally normalisation of the ECG over several weeks.
** other anomalies suggestive of tamponade: microvoltage, electrical alternation (variation in the amplitude of the QRS, generally 1 in 2).
