'''Clinical monitoring -'''' Assessment of disease activity (DAS28), to check the effectiveness of current treatments; the tolerance of current treatments; the patient's general condition; any extra-articular or systemic manifestations; any co-morbidities, particularly cardiovascular, tumour or infectious diseases.

'''Biological monitoring -'''' Regular monitoring of biological markers used to assess disease activity (sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein) and to detect any adverse events induced by current treatments (in particular haemogram, liver parameters, renal function).
