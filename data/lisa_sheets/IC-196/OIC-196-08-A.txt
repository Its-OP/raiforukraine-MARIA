'''General principles -''' Coordination of the therapeutic management of patients by the rheumatologist, monitored jointly with the general practitioner. Information on therapeutic management, with particular emphasis on the risk/benefit ratio and the importance of compliance with medication ([[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SD-279]] ; [[Follow-up of the immunosuppressed patient SD-291]] ;

[[Identifying the consequences of a pathology/situation on job retention SD-316]]; [[Prevention of cardiovascular diseases SD-320]]; [[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328]]; [[Assessment of therapeutic compliance SD-354|Assessment of therapeutic compliance SD-354]]).

'''Objectives -''' Achievement of the objective of remission (DAS28 < 2.6) or, failing that, of a low level of activity (DAS28 ≤ 3.2) of the disease; prevention of structural lesions; prevention of functional disability; preservation of the patient's quality of life and socio-professional capacities.

'''Education and information''' (Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352

'''Drug treatment'''

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with possible rotation of NSAIDs ([[Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249|Prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249]])

- Analgesics avoiding the use of opioids ([[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259]]; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260]]; [[Prescribing analgesics SD-250]])


'''Local treatments:''' in the case of arthritis (corticosteroid infiltration, isotopic synoviorthesis) or enthesopathy (cortisone infiltration) (Prescribe general or local corticosteroids SD-25).

'''First-line disease-modifying therapy -''' Methotrexate initiated as early as possible, in the absence of contraindication, taking into account the special warnings and precautions for use.

Non-pharmacological treatments

- stop smoking, regular physical activity. Therapeutic lifestyle modification (sleep, physical activity, diet, etc.) SD-324

- physiotherapy - occupational therapy: to reduce pain, deformity and disability. In relapse: analgesic methods (application of cold), passive mobilisation, rest orthoses. Out of relapse: combating joint stiffening, muscle strengthening and functional work (walking, gripping, etc.). Appliances depending on the difficulties encountered ([[Prescription of a rehabilitation SD-247]]; [[Prescription of a simple appliance SDD-245|Prescription of a simple appliance SD-245]]).

'''Surgery:''' prosthetic joint replacement if necessary

'''Social cover:''' 100% cover (ALD) for severe or disabling forms<br />.
