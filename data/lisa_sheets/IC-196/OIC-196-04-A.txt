'''Biological signs -''' Inconsistent elevation of C-reactive protein or even sedimentation rate ([[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186]]; [[Elevation of c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203]]). Inconsistent positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein autoantibodies (however, at a high specificity threshold, ACPA also has very good sensitivity). Sterile inflammatory synovial fluid without microcrystals if joint puncture.

'''Radiographic signs -'''' Systematic initial X-rays of the hands and wrists from the front, the forefeet from the front and the forefeet from three-quarters, normal or revealing bone erosions or diffuse pinching of the joint spaces ([[Discovery of a bone and joint anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-228]]) '''(Image 2).'''''

'''Ultrasound signs -'''' Joint ultrasound in cases of clinical doubt, consistently revealing intra-articular fluid effusion, synovial thickening with or without synovial hyperhaemia (active synovitis), tenosynovitis and/or bone erosions.
