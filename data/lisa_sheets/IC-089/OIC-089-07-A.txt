'''Characteristics of conductive hearing loss:'''

*mechanical sound transmission defect in the outer or middle ear
*moderate hearing loss (max 60 dB) but never total, without distortion, often predominantly in the bass range
*Weber lateralized on the deaf side, Rinne negative (CO>CA)
*tonal audiogram: normal CO and low CA
*tympanogram (retro-tympanic effusion, tubal dysfunction, ossicular dislocation) and stapedial reflex investigation (otosclerosis), and otoscopy (acute otitis media, seromucosal otitis, cholesteatoma, etc.).
*surgical treatment often possible, effective hearing aid
