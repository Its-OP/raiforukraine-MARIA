Tuning fork acoumetry is used to explore bone conduction (CO, foot of the tuning fork in contact with the bone) and air conduction (CA, branches of the tuning fork in front of the external auditory canal).

Weber test: the patient places the tuning fork at the vertex and indicates on which side the sound is perceived to be louder.

*Normal hearing: sound perceived at the centre.
*Sensorineural hearing loss: sound perceived on the side of the ear least affected
*Conductive deafness: sound perceived on the side of the ear most affected

Rinne test: foot of the tuning fork on the mastoid (CO), then in front of the canal (CA) when the CO is no longer perceived.

*Normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss: CO < CA (Rinne positive)
*Conductive hearing loss: CO > CA (negative Rinne)
