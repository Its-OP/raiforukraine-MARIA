The imaging examination of choice for the exploration of sensorineural hearing loss is ''<nowiki/>'MRI of the cerebellopontine roches and angles injected in thin sections'' which allows endo or retro-labyrinthine anomalies to be visualised

In some cases, in particular for the exploration of certain inner ear anomalies (malformations, canal dehiscence), CT of the rocks allows better characterisation of anatomical anomalies.

'''The following MS (sensorineural hearing loss) situations require an MRI of the rocks:'''

*Sudden unilateral deafness
*Unilateral or <u>asymmetric</u> progressive sensorineural hearing loss (look for a vestibular schwannoma).
*Suspicion of Meni√®re's disease (initial MRI to rule out a differential diagnosis)
*Suspicion of labyrinthitis

MRI can be used to rule out an acoustic neuroma, among other things.
