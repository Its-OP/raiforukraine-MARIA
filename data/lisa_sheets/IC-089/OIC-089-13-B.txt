Sensorineural hearing loss in children, and particularly severe or profound hearing loss, should be assessed by CT scan (thin sections of bone) + MRI (brain and bone). This assessment is for aetiological and pre-operative purposes for children being considered for a cochlear implant.

*CT scan of the rocks: to look for malformations of the inner ear, morphological assessment of the middle ear.
*MRI of the brain and rocks: to look for a cochleovestibular malformation, to look for agenesis of the auditory nerve, to look for other associated brain abnormalities.
