Impedancemetry (sometimes called tympanometry) is an objective examination of the impedance of the middle ear using an impedancemeter fitted with a tip placed in the external auditory canal. This device allows two distinct measurements to be taken:

*The tympanogram: measurement of the compliance ("elasticity" of the tympano-ossicular system) as a function of the pressure applied in the external auditory canal.
*''Stapedial reflex test'': threshold for triggering reflex contraction of the stapedial muscle in response to a loud sound (>80 dB).
