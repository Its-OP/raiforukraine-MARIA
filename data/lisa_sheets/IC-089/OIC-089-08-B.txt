The examination of choice for the exploration of conductive hearing loss (CHD) is the ''thin-section CT scan of the rocks''. It allows precise visualisation of the ossicles, pneumatisation or a tissue opacity of the middle ear, an otosclerosis focus, etc.

*cholesteatoma: otoscopic diagnosis but extension and preoperative assessment by CT scan essential
*chronic noncholesteatomatousotitis, suspected ossicular involvement: CT scan can be used to assess the ossicular involvement in order to determine the origin of the ST
*otosclerosis: CT scan required to confirm the presence of the otosclerosis focus and rule out a differential diagnosis
*seromucosal otitis in children: no imaging necessary as first-line treatment
