'''Characteristics of sensorineural hearing loss:'''

*neurosensory abnormality in the detection and processing of sound information at the endocochlear or retrocochlear level
*deterioration in hearing thresholds, but also sound distortion, hearing discomfort in noisy environments, tinnitus
*varying degrees of deafness (from mild to profound), often predominantly in the high frequency range
*look for other signs of inner ear damage: dizziness or instability
*Weber lateralized on the less affected side, Rinne positive (CO < CA)
*tonal audiometry: CO and CA lowered and close together; voice audiometry: can reveal distortions.
*Stapedial reflexes are of interest.
**Retrocochlear deafness: SR often abolished''''
**'''endocochlear deafness: RS often preserved''' (even triggered at a threshold < 80 dB) because recruitment
*rehabilitation relies primarily on hearing aids, which can be difficult in the case of high distortion.
