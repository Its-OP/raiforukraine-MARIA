There are 3 main types of deafness, defined according to tonal audiometry:

*conductive deafness'': normal CO and impaired CA, the two curves are not adjacent. Involves damage to the outer or middle ear (tympanic-ossicular system).

*sensorineural hearing loss'': altered bone condition (CO) and air conduction (CA), the two curves remaining close together. Involves damage to the inner ear (endocochlear sensorineural deafness) or the auditory nerve (retrocochlear sensorineural deafness).

*mixed deafness'': a combination of sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. CO and CA are impaired, but there is a gap between the curves (CA more impaired than CO). Concerns mixed disorders, most often middle ear + inner ear.
