Auditory evoked potentials (AEP) are objective measurements of neuronal electrical activity in the auditory pathways in response to sound stimulation, collected by surface electrodes. The response takes the form of five main waves from I to V, corresponding to the various relays between the cochlea and the brain stem. ABR can be used to detect :

*objective auditory thresholds'' (the lowest intensity for which an AEP response is detectable), for example in young children
*'''unilateral prolongation of wave latencies'' (I-V interval) indicating retro-cochlear damage, for example in vestibular schwannoma

There are ''automated PEA (PEAA) devices used for neonatal screening'' for deafness which automatically look for the presence of an electrophysiological response to weak stimulation and give a binary result (present/absent).
