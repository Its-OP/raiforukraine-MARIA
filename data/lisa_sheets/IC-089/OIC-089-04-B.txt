Pure-tone and speech audiometry are two subjective hearing tests (depending on the subject's response), performed in a soundproof booth. Pure-tone audiometry corresponds to what the subject "hears", and speech audiometry to what the subject "understands".

'''Initial tonal audiometry:''''

*Finds the subject's detection thresholds (lowest level of detectable intensity in dB), for frequencies between 125 and 8000 Hz for air conduction CA (using headphones), and between 125 and 4000 Hz for bone conduction CO (using a vibrator).
*Allows you to plot the tonal audiogram, representing thresholds as a function of frequency, ear by ear.
*Allows you to classify deafness according to the average AC over 500-1000-2000-4000 Hz, from normal hearing to profound deafness.

'''Voice audiometry:'''

*Evaluates the percentage of words correctly repeated at different levels of intensity.
*Can be performed with headphones and separate ears, or with a loudspeaker to evaluate a hearing aid, for example.
*Allows you to plot the vocal audiogram, representing the percentage of words repeated as a function of the presentation level in dB.
