Classification and definition of peripheral neuropathies :

'''Mononeuropathy''' : damage to a nerve trunk ;

'''Multiple mononeuropathy''': involvement of several nerve trunks (multineuritis);

'''Plexopathies''' are lesions of the nerve plexuses. Damage to the brachial plexus is the most common;

Polyneuropathy'': damage to all nerve fibres, depending on their length (length-dependent damage);

'''Polyradiculoneuropathy''': involvement of all sensory and motor nerve roots and nerve trunks (e.g. Guillain-Barr√© syndrome);

'''Neuronopathy''': damage to the cell body of the neuron (motor or sensory).
