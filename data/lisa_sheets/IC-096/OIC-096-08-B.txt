Demyelinating polyeuropathies are either hereditary, predominantly motor, or acquired, predominantly ataxic, related to an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with anti-MAG activity '''([[SD-193 serum protein electrophoresis analysis|serum protein electrophoresis analysis]])'''';

Neuropathy associated with IgM monoclonal gammopathy with anti-MAG activity ;

- Neuropathy in people over 50.

- Ataxic, associated with hand tremor '''([[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])''''

- Little motor deficit at first.

- Slowly progressive.

- The electroneuromygram (ENMG) showed demyelinating polyneuropathy, predominantly distal.

Hereditary neuropathies are dominated by the sensitivomotor polyneuropathies of Charcot-Marie-Tooth. '''([[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]])''''

- Atrophy of the calves, sunken feet, predominantly motor-sensory involvement.  Little or no sensory symptoms (paresthesias).

- Autosomal dominant demyelinating forms are the best characterised.

- Diagnosis is made by genetic testing: duplication of the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17 in dominant forms.
