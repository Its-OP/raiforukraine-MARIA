'''Principle of diagnosis'''

Clinically, ALS is characterised by a ''pure, progressive motor deficit'' combining a ''peripheral motor neuron syndrome'' (PMN) with a ''central motor neuron syndrome'' (CMN) in the bulbar, cervical and lumbosacral territories.

The average age of onset is 63. ALS leads to death in all cases. '''([[Announcement of a critical illness diagnosis to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a critical illness diagnosis to the patient and/or family]])''''

'''Key elements of the diagnosis'''

The diagnosis of ALS is based essentially on clinical data and neurophysiological examination with the association :

- Peripheral motor neuron damage (see above) and central motor neuron damage (Babinski sign, spasticity) affecting the limbs and face.

- Gradual evolution;

- Ultimately responsible for speech, swallowing and respiratory disorders and death requiring emergency assessment and treatment. '''([[Dysphonia SD-146|dysphonia]]) ([[Swallowing disorders or misdirections SD-062|swallowing disorders or misdirections]]) ([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|acute respiratory distress]]) ([[Cough SD-167|cough]]) ([[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]])'''''

- And l'''' absence of sensory, sphincter, cerebellar or oculomotor disorders''.

It should be noted that almost 20% of patients develop frontotemporal cognitive disorders.

Pure motor neuropathy, such as conduction block motor neuropathy, will not show signs of central motor neuron damage or cognitive manifestations.

Neurophysiological examination will confirm pure motor impairment
