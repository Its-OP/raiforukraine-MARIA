'''Neuronopathy''':

- Damage to the cell body of the neuron (motor or sensory);

- Sensory neuropathies can have several presentations; the most characteristic is the association of :

- Non-length-dependent asymmetric sensory disorders of the limbs

(characteristically, both upper limbs and lower limbs are used simultaneously)

- Diffuse areflexia;

- Ataxia; '''([[Balance disorder SD-130|balance disorder]])''''

- Hyperproteinorachia and cellular reaction in paraneoplastic origin ''([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]])''';

- Clinically, they may take the form of polyneuropathy, the diagnosis being confirmed by the CSF and, above all, the diffuse abolition of sensory potentials on neurophysiological examination;''([[Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SD-183|analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]])''''
