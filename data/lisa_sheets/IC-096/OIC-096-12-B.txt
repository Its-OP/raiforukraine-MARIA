'''Strategy for using complementary examinations'''

The choice of complementary investigations during peripheral neuropathies must be structured '''([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]])''''

The investigation of peripheral neuropathy always requires neurophysiological investigation using an electroneuromyogram.

The first-line biological work-up is straightforward, and is directed towards the existence of metabolic disorders and an inflammatory syndrome. It must be completed according to the diagnostic hypotheses in the second instance.

Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid provides information about the proximal nature of the peripheral nerve damage and its mechanism (inflammation, demyelination, paraneoplastic reaction)''([[Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SD-183|analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]])'''.

Finally, nerve or neuromuscular biopsy is an invasive procedure which must be discussed in a collegial manner before it is carried out. '''([[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SD-180|interpretation of an anatomopathology report]])''''

Neurophysiological exploration

The electroneuromyogram (ENMG) is essential for characterising the neuropathy and determining its mechanism: demyelinating, axonal or neuronal.

The electromyogram, a detection test, shows the neurogenic nature of the abnormalities: fibrillation potentials, reduction in the number of motor units, acceleration in the frequency of potentials, simple tracing.

Gives a topographical indication (truncal, radicular, diffuse).

'''Measurement of nerve conduction (stimulodetection test)'''

It reflects the pathophysiological mechanism:

- Demyelinating neuropathies :

o Slowing of motor conduction speeds ;

o Longer F-wave latencies;

o Lengthening of distal motor latencies ;

o Dispersion of action potentials,

o Motor conduction blocks,

- Axonal neuropathies :

o Normal (or moderately slow) speeds ;

o Decrease in the amplitude of the action potential of the motor response ;

o Decrease in the amplitude of the action potential of the sensitive response

- Sensory neuropathies :

o Decreased amplitude or diffuse abolition (in all four limbs) of the sensory action potential ;

o Normality of motor parameters ;

- Motor neuronopathies :

o Decrease in the amplitude of the motor action potential, of variable topography depending on the cause;

o Normality of sensory parameters ;

'''Biological exploration'''

A minimal biological approach including : CBC, VS-CRP, fasting blood glucose and blood glucose 2 hours after 75 g glucose po, ionogram, liver function tests, haemostasis, immunofixation of serum immunoglobulins for monoclonal gammopathy. '''([[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]) ([[Serum protein electrophoresis analysis SD-193|serum protein electrophoresis analysis]]) ([[Elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP)]])'''''

Other biological investigations will be guided by the context.

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid

It provides arguments for the proximal (radicular or neuronal) nature of the neuropathic damage. It is mainly used in polyradiculoneuritis and sensory neuropathy. '''([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]])''''

- Isolated hyperproteinorachia in polyradiculoneuritis and diabetes.

- Cellular reaction in certain paraneoplastic diseases.

- Genuine meningitis in cases of neoplastic, haematological and infectious diseases.

Neuromuscular biopsy

Nerve or neuromuscular biopsy is discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting because it is an invasive procedure which leads to nerve amputation''([[Preoperative explanation and consent form for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|preoperative explanation and consent form for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]])''. It is therefore never performed as a first-line procedure.

It is most often performed on a sensory nerve in the leg (sensitive branch of the fibular nerve or sural nerve).

Biopsies are mainly performed :

- If vasculitis is suspected;

- In cases of diagnostic doubt in the presence of progressive peripheral neuropathy with no known cause.

It can be used to highlight diagnostic arguments:

- Arterial occlusion in vasculitis and fascicular axonal loss ;

- Amyloid deposits in amyloid neuropathy.

- Inflammatory lesions and demyelination/remyelination in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.

When the biopsy is neuromuscular, the muscle biopsied provides information on the muscular impact of the motor component of the neuropathy. '''([[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SD-180|interpretation of an anatomopathology report]]).'''''
