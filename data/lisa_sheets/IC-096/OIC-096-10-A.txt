'''Multiple mononeuronopathies''''

- They are linked to damage to several nerve trunks.

- They present asymmetrically, acutely, usually with pain and motor deficits.

- Their diagnosis is urgent, looking for vasculitis '''([[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]) [[SDD-203|(elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP)])''', by nerve biopsy '''([[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SD-180|interpretation of an anatomopathology report]]).''''

- Treatment must be initiated rapidly.

'''Causes'''

- Vasculitis of the medium-sized vessels: periarteritis nodosa.

- Small-vessel vasculitis :

- ANCA vasculitis ;

- Essential cryoglobulinemia ;

- Vasculitis associated with a systemic disease :

- Cryoglobulinaemia in association with hepatitis C virus infection '''([[Interpretation of an SD-236 serology result|interpretation of a serology result]])''';

- HIV infection ;

- Cancer satellite vasculitis.

A part

- Diabetes does not require a neuromuscular biopsy.

- Leprosy, which causes multiple mononeuropathies with a predominance of sensitivity, is a major cause of neuropathy worldwide, but is rare in France.
