The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy requires a structured approach comprising the following stages.

- Localisation": this consists of determining whether it is truncal, radicular, plexus or neuronal (cell body damage). With the help of questioning and clinical examination.

- Pathophysiological mechanism: this consists of determining whether the neuropathy is demyelinating, axonal or neuronal. Using neurophysiological tests (electroneuromyogram)

- Electroclinical classification'': synthesis of the previous two stages.

- Search for the cause": the main causes of neuropathy are relatively limited based on electroclinical classification.

Clinical examination

The diagnosis is based on the more or less complete association of three types of signs. '''([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]])''''

'''a. Motor signs'''

The motor signs associate '''([[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]])''' :

- Paralysis or paresis; '''([[Muscular weakness SD-074|muscular weakness]]) ([[Heavy legs SD-076|heavy legs]])''''

- Muscular atrophy;

- Fasciculations;

- Cramps;

- A reduction or abolition of tendon reflexes.     

'''b. Sensory signs'''

Often the first to appear.

Symptoms:

- These abnormal sensations (''''[[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]])'''':

- Paraesthesia,

- Dysaesthesia,

- Pain '''([[Pain in a limb (upper or lower) SD-071|douleur d'un membre (supérieur ou inférieur)]])''''

Signs

- Disorders of superficial sensitivities (to tact, or epicritic and proprioceptive sensitivities. '''([[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])''''

- Ataxia is suggestive of demyelinating neuropathy.

'''c. Neurovegetative signs'''

- Vasomotor, trophic, orthostatic hypotension ''([[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo and dizziness]])''', impotence, digestive, urinary, pupillary motility

'''Neurophysiological examination'''

- Have a strategy for using complementary tests
