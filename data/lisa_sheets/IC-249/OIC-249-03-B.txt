The development of psychosocial skills (PSC) acts as a determinant of overall health (physical, psychological and social), with an impact on self-esteem, social interaction and self-awareness.


Among the SPCs, there are (WHO 2003) :

1/ social skills, including verbal and non-verbal communication skills, empathy, resistance and negotiation skills, cooperation and advocacy skills.

2/ cognitive skills, including decision-making and problem-solving skills, the ability to receive information, critical thinking and self-assessment.

3/ Emotional skills: emotional regulation, expression of emotions, stress management, self-awareness and self-regulation skills.


In the context of chronic illnesses, psychosocial skills include coping skills such as knowing when and how to seek help from those around them, knowing how to use the resources of the healthcare system, asserting one's rights, analysing information received about one's illness and treatment, asserting one's healthcare choices, expressing one's feelings about one's illness and implementing adjustment behaviours, establishing links between one's illness and one's life history, formulating a plan and implementing it.


Reinforcing SPCs helps to bring about changes in behaviour and maintain them over time. The levers for action to improve them are: positive attention, (benevolent) listening, an empathetic attitude, appreciation and positive reinforcement, expression of expectations, therapeutic education.
