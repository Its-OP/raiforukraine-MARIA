Three components of eating behaviour: nutritional, hedonic, cultural


Physiological sensations to be investigated on examination :

- '''Hunger:''' physical sensations secondary to the physiological need to eat without specificity, to nourish the organism,

- '''Appetite:''' the desire to eat a food or a group of foods, usually with pleasant anticipation,

- '''Rassasiement''': corresponds to the extinction of the hunger signal, normally at the end of the meal, without the appearance of a new physical signal (sensation of gastric tension, in particular, which means that the individual has passed the satiation stage).

- '''Satiety:''' sensation of fullness in the stomach, the period between satiation and the reappearance of hunger before the next food intake.


Assessment of eating behaviour (meal and non-meal): includes assessment of quality, quantity and daily distribution; possibility of using a food diary, a 24-hour reminder, a food frequency questionnaire.


Before recommending any dietary changes, depending on the situation, we need to look for a loss of appetite linked to a mood disorder or a chronic pathology (inflammatory disease or cancer), excessive restriction, an emotional trigger or impulsive eating that reflects a loss of control over eating, or even an eating behaviour disorder (EBD).


Screening for eating disorders:

''Symptoms to look for:''

- '''Prandial hyperphagia:''' increase in calorie intake during meals (either an increase in the quantity or energy density of the food eaten)

- '''Tachyphagia:''' rapid food intake

- '''Noctophagy:''' nocturnal food intake

- '''Grignotage:''' repeated ingestion of small quantities of food without feeling hungry or appetite

- '''Compulsive/impulsive eating:''' impulsive/brutal consumption of a food / outside of meals / in response to a craving; initial pleasure quickly replaced by a feeling of guilt, similar to ''craving'' (urgency to eat).

- '''Bulimic attack:''' ingestion of large quantities of food (stopping following epigastralgia/vomiting, limiting factor in intake= gastric containment) with a notion of loss of control and a feeling of anguish and shame; behaviour often hidden from family and friends.

- '''Anorexia:''' absence of hunger, maintenance of a state of inhibition of food intake

- '''Cognitive restriction:''' the tendency to voluntarily restrict one's diet in order to lose weight
