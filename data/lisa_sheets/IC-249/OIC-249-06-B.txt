Physical activity is recommended for the secondary and tertiary prevention of many chronic diseases. Promoting it and prescribing it appropriately is a new element in the therapeutic arsenal available to doctors.


The recommended physical activity (PA) is :

- '''More than 150 minutes a week''' '''of moderate-intensity PA''' (e.g. brisk walking: moderate aerobic breathlessness)

- '''OR'''' '''more than 75 minutes per week of sustained-intensity PA'' (e.g. running)

- '''AND at least 2 times a week of muscle-strengthening exercise'''

- Limit prolonged sitting

- balance exercises for elderly people at risk of falling.


In order to obtain additional health benefits and in the absence of contraindications, adults should increase the duration of their moderate-intensity endurance activity to 300 minutes per week or perform 150 minutes per week of sustained-intensity endurance activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and sustained-intensity activity.


'''Tips for physical activity'''

- Present physical activity as both a health issue (reducing cardiovascular risk, improving physical fitness, etc.) and a quality of life issue (relieving tension, socialising, regaining body awareness, improving sleep, etc.). The potential benefits should be set out according to the person's needs, and better still, have them set them out.

- Question previous physical and sporting activities to determine the level of practice (competition) and the usual level of sedentariness, the person's experience of these activities and the reasons for any interruptions.

- The advice must be seen in the context of individual, step-by-step, long-term progress, as close as possible to the person's day-to-day life and living environment, to encourage its implementation and sustainability.

- In some cases, physical activity will be the first priority. In other cases, advice will come second (e.g. after psychosocial support or treatment for sleep apnoea syndrome).


Adults suffering from these chronic diseases: practise muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or higher intensity (following a rehabilitation programme in the case of cardiovascular or COPD pathologies), involving all the main muscle groups, at least two days a week, as they provide additional benefits.

Older people: also practise varied, multi-component physical activity that focuses on functional balance and strength training at moderate or higher intensity, at least three days a week, to improve functional capacity and prevent falls.
