''Known beneficial effects of regular physical activity:''

- Increased life expectancy

- Reduction in overall cardiovascular risk and in the risk of hypertension, ACS and OSA

- Reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity

- Reduced risk of certain cancers (breast, colon)

- Psychological benefits (lower prevalence of depression and anxiety)

- Prevention of cognitive disorders

- Benefits for age-related pathologies (combating sarcopenia, reducing osteoporosis, maintaining independence, reducing the risk of falls)

|'''Pre-existing pathology'''
|'''The effects of physical activity'''
|-
|Cancer
|Depending on location :

Reduced risk of mortality and recurrence

Reduced fatigue, improved tolerance of treatment and better quality of life

Boosts immunity
|-
|Obesity
|Reduction in weight and body fat (modest, a few kg), visceral abdominal fat, etc.

Improved metabolic parameters (glycaemic balance, lipid profile)

Reduced risk of weight regain
|-
|Type 2 diabetes
|Reduced risk of mortality

Improvement in markers of disease progression: HbA1C, blood pressure and lipid profile

Reduction in abdominal circumference,

Limiting the loss of muscle mass
|-
|High blood pressure
|Reduced risk of progression of cardiovascular disease Reduced risk of increase in blood pressure over time
|-
|Ischaemic heart disease/chronic heart failure/lower limb arterial disease
|Improved functional and vital prognosis

Lower blood pressure

Improved endothelial function

Development of neovessels
|-
|Chronic respiratory diseases (particularly COPD)
|Improvement in physical capacity and quality of life Improvement in dyspnoea and exercise tolerance

Reduced anxiety

Better control of COPD and asthma symptoms

(No change in lung function in adults)
|-
|Parkinson's disease, Stroke, Schizophrenia Dementia, Hyperactivity disorder, Attention deficit disorder
|Improved cognitive function
<br />
|-
|Parkinson's disease, Stroke, Multiple sclerosis
|Improved walking, muscle strength and balance
|-
|Depression and anxiety disorders
|Reduced signs of anxiety and depression

Mood enhancement
|-
|Schizophrenia
|Improved quality of life
|-
|Rheumatic diseases, Osteoarthritis (hip and knee)
|Reduced pain

Improved functional capabilities

Improving quality of life

The beneficial effects observed have been widely proven and are due to changes in the major physiological systems:

- Improvement in maximum ventilation and aerobic capacity (as opposed to the physiological reduction in VO2max)

- Release of NO by the endothelium and reduced physiological damage to the vessel wall

- Reduced insulin resistance and improved glucose metabolism

- Increased muscle mass and power

- Increased cerebral angiogenesis

- Cellular action via mitochondria on oxidative stress

- Improved bone mineral density
