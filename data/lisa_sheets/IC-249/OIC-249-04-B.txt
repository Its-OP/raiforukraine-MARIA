''Definition and objectives:''

The aim of therapeutic patient education (TPE) is to improve the quality of life of people with chronic illnesses.

The aim of TVE is to help patients acquire or maintain the skills they need to manage their lives as effectively as possible with their chronic disease(s), promote autonomy and encourage compliance.

TVE is not simply a matter of providing information to patients; it is a structured approach that is applied throughout the course of the disease. Every healthcare professional can contribute at any point in the patient's healthcare pathway.


''The different stages in a therapeutic education approach:''

- Establishing a shared educational diagnosis: exploring the patient's experience of the disease, understanding their expectations and needs; building an educational partnership between the carer and the patient.

- Gathering and putting into perspective the patient's perceptions, which can sometimes be excessive and therefore a source of frustration or feelings of incapacity.

- Defining a personalised TVE programme: defining the objectives to be achieved and identifying the patient's learning priorities.

- Plan and implement TVE sessions (individual or group, or alternating)

- Assess the skills acquired: what has changed in the patient, what are the new needs, plan for educational follow-up.


''Determining TVE objectives with the patient:''

- Setting precise, achievable, patient-specific and limited objectives

- Reassessment/adjustment of objectives achieved and not achieved at each follow-up consultation

- Positive reinforcement (encourage/congratulate on positive points)

- Understand/specify unachieved objectives without moralizing

- Encouraging new changes


The caregiver's educational stance is important for achieving the objectives of TVE and MTMV. It is a transformation of day-to-day professional practice which must replace the traditionally injunctive or prescriptive postures. The posture of the carer is likely to slow down or even block the patient's motivation. Carers need to know how to conduct motivational interviews:

- legitimise the changes, give meaning to the change project by explaining the links between the behaviours to be changed and the health issues at stake

- listening and cognitive and psychosocial support

- not to generate anxiety, which encourages avoidance behaviour in most people)

- do not force resistance to change; put the patient's choices into perspective and respect them
