Hypercapnia, even when severe, is not a contraindication to oxygen therapy.

The saturation target will be 88%<Saturation<92%. Close gas monitoring should assess the impact of oxygen therapy on PaCO2.

In the event of significant alveolar hypoventilation, nocturnal non-invasive ventilation may be initiated in addition to oxygen therapy. The clinical and gasometric criteria for initiating long-term NIV vary according to the underlying pathologies.
