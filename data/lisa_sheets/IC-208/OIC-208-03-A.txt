Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is defined as mean pulmonary arterial pressure >20 mmHg and resistance >3 UW measured during right heart catheterisation. When it is secondary to CKD, it is classified in group 3 of PH. It is suspected on cardiac ultrasound by assessment of systolic blood pressure (SBP >35mmHg). Confirmation by right heart catheterisation is rarely indicated in cases of documented CKD.
