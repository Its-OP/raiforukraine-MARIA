*Hypoxaemia with normo or hypocapnia (increase in the alveolar-arterial difference)
**Diseases of the pulmonary exchanger (see above)
*predominantly alveolar hypoventilation
**Diseases of the ventilatory pump
*COPD is above all a disease of the exchanger with hypoxaemia and normo/hypocapnia initially. At a later stage, alveolar hypoventilation may appear in the most severe patients.
