The aim of long-term oxygen therapy (LTO) is to correct the consequences of chronic hypoxaemia (polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension) and to reduce mortality. It is not a symptomatic treatment for dyspnoea.

Indication in stable obstructive CKD:''

* ''PaO<sub>2</sub> < 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa)''
* ''oIndication in stable obstructive CKD:u PaO<sub>2</sub> between 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa) and 60 mmHg (8 kPa) with clinical signs of tissue hypoxia:''
** ''polyglobuliIndication in obstructive CKD in stable state:e (haematocrit > 55%)''
** ''inIndication in stable obstructive CKD:right ventricular adequacy (clinical or echocardiographic or via catheterisation)''
** ''not indicated in stable obstructive CKD: non-apnoeic nocturnal arterial saturations (mean nocturnal SpO<sub>2</sub> â‰¤ 88%)''

Indication in stable obstructive CKD:''

''Indication in restrictive CKD in stable state: PaO<sub>2</sub> < 60 mmHg.''

Oxygen therapy is administered :

- At home, using nasal cannula (masks can deliver larger quantities of O<sub>2</sub>),

- Ideally 24 hours a day, at least 15 hours a day, including nights and physical activity,

- With a flow rate required to obtain a PaO<sub>2</sub> > 60 mmHg or a SpO<sub>2</sub> or a SaO<sub>2</sub> > 90% at rest and during exercise

- Gaseous oxygen (by extractor or in the form of gaseous cylinders for ambulation) is preferred for moderate flow rates. Liquid oxygen is used for high oxygen flow rates.

- It is delivered by a home service provider.
