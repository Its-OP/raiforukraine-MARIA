The main causes of CKD can be grouped according to the predominant pathophysiological mechanism:

*Diseases of the pulmonary exchanger
**Impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio: COPD, bronchial dilatation
**Impairment of alveolar-capillary diffusion: diffuse infiltrative lung disease.
*Diseases of the ventilatory pump
**Neuromuscular diseases
**Decreased thoracic compliance (skeletal deformities, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome)
**Impairment of ventilatory control (rare brain stem disorders, major respiratory impairment by respiratory depressant drugs)
