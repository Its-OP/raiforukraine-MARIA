There are 3 levels of risk that influence screening strategies:

- High risk: very high risk (women with BRCA1 or 2 mutations) or high risk with a relative risk â‰¥ 2 who should undergo specific screening:

- personal history of breast cancer (invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ) ;

- personal history of high-dose radiotherapy (Hodgkin's disease) ;

- personal history of "borderline" lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular hyperplasia with atypia, lobular carcinoma in situ);

- family history (breast and adnexal cancer) in the absence of a BRCA1 and 2 mutation, as advised by the oncogeneticist.


- Average risk: all women aged between 50 and 74 and women who have tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations in oncogenetic tests, but who come from a family carrying the BRCA 1 and 2 genes.

- Low risk: unaffected women who have had a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy and are BRCA2 mutation carriers.
