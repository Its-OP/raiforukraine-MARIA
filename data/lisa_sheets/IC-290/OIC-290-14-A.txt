The main risk factors for colorectal cancer are :

ÃÅ

- '''Age:''' The risk of colorectal cancer increases significantly after the age of 50. More than 50% of cases are diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 74;

- '''Personal or family history of colorectal adenoma or cancer.'''

The risk depends on the size, histological type and degree of dysplasia of the polyp.

- '''Personal history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)''''

- '''Genetic mutations:'''

o ''Familial adenomatous polyposis'' is an autosomal dominant genetic disease. Patients develop numerous colonic adenomas, around the age of 15 in 50% of cases. If left untreated, all of these patients will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 40.

o '''For Lynch syndrome or HNPCC ('''hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer), the risk of developing colorectal cancer during one's lifetime is around 10% at age 50 and 40% at age 70.

- '''Modifiable risk factors''' '''':'''' high consumption of red meat, alcohol, tobacco, physical inactivity, overweight, low fibre intake
