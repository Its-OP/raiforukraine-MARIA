Cervical cancer is '''constantly attributable''' to infection by one or more '''human papillomaviruses (HPV)''' which are transmitted through sexual intercourse and human-to-human contact. HPV 16 and 18 are the most oncogenic and are found in around 75% of cervical and anal cancers. Conversely, HPV 6 and 11 are responsible for non-cancerous condylomas. The evolution of an oncogenic HPV infection is rare and slow: less than 0.3% of infections develop into cancer, as they are usually transient (8 to 18 months).
