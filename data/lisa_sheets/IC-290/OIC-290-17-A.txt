The main risk factor for lung cancer is active or passive smoking (85-90% of bronchopulmonary cancers). The excess risk incurred by a smoker depends on his average daily consumption (dose of tobacco) and even more on how long he has been smoking (duration of exposure): doubling the dose doubles the excess risk of lung cancer, while doubling the duration of smoking multiplies the excess risk by 20.

Other environmental or occupational factors are recognised as carcinogenic (asbestos, diesel exhaust, radon, arsenic, nickel, cobalt, chromium, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, exposure to certain ionising radiations, silica, cadmium).

For a person exposed to asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is multipliedÃÅ by 5 in a non-smoking patient and multiplied by 50 in a smoking patient.

Other factors appear to be involved in lung cancer: inhaled cannabis, previous radiotherapy to the chest or occupational or accidental exposure to ionising radiation.
