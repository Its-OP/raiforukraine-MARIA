The proportions of cancers linked to the main preventable risk factors are, in descending order:

Tobacco, responsible for 19.8% of cancers (68,000 new cases of cancer in 2015)

L''''alcool''', responsible for 8% of cancers (28,000 new cases of cancer in 2015)

An "unbalanced diet" (high in salt, red meat, fat and sugar, low in fibre, fruit and vegetables) responsible for 5.4% of cancers

Overweight and obesity, responsible for 5.4% of cancers (19,000 new cases of cancer in 2015)

Sedentary lifestyle (less than 30 minutes of physical activity per day) responsible for 0.9% of cancers

Lifestyle changes can therefore be encouraged as part of the primary prevention of cancer, with particular emphasis on harmful tobacco and alcohol consumption.
