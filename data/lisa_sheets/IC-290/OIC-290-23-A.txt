== Primary prevention is based on HPV vaccination ==
Since HPV viruses are transmitted by ''sexual contact, without necessarily penetration'', wearing a condom is one way of reducing the risk of co-infection. Vaccination is the only effective means of primary prevention against HPV, especially if it is carried out before or soon after the first sexual intercourse. The current vaccination rate (around 30% for full vaccination in 2011) is insufficient to provide herd immunity.

HPV vaccination is recommended in France for girls:

o from 11 to 13 years of age with a schedule of 2 injections spaced 6 months apart ;

o Young girls not previously vaccinated can catch up between the ages of 14 and 19 with 3 injections administered according to a 0, 2 and 6 month schedule for Gardasil<sup>®</sup> with 4 (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18) and 9 valences (HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58), which replaces it.

Since December 2019, HPV vaccination has also been recommended for boys:

             From 11 to 13 years of age, with a schedule of 2 injections spaced 6 months apart

             From 14 to 19 years of age with 3 injections administered according to a schedule of 0, 2 and 6 months.

             Men who have sex with men: up to the age of 26, with 3 injections administered according to a schedule of 0, 2 and 6 months.

'''Vaccine side-effects:''' no serious side-effects have been found, in particular no increase in autoimmune diseases. Adverse reactions are most often local (pain, swelling, redness), qualified as severe for around one person in 20 with Gardasil9<sup>®</sup>.
