The ''proven risk factors'' for prostate cancer are :

'''Age:''' the probabilitý of developing prostate cancer is low before the age of 50 and increases with age,

'''Heredity - family history of prostate cancer:''' the relative risk is estimated at 2 to 3.5 in the case of prostate cancer among a first-degree relative. The risk of prostate cancer diagnosis increases with the number of affected family members and is multiplied́ by a factor of around 10 in the case of a so-called hereditary form.
