Ventilator-associated lung disease

- Avoid ventilation by tracheal intubation whenever possible, preferring non-invasive ventilation and limiting its duration as much as possible

- Prevention of micro-inhalation by ventilation in a semi-seated position, regular or continuous suctioning of secretions and regular mouth care,

- Use antibacterial respirator filters

- Carry out hand hygiene before treatment (bronchial aspirations, handling ventilator circuits, etc.)

- Compliance with respirator maintenance and handling rules


Non-acquired bacterial pneumonia under mechanical ventilation

- Limiting decubitus and promoting mobility

- Avoid unnecessary sedation

- Do not feed a patient lying down

- Oral hygiene (mouth care and dentures)

- Preventing false routes (e.g. foods of the right consistency)

Legionellosis

- Ensure rigorous maintenance and regular purging of water points, particularly showers

- Install a filter on water points used by immunocompromised patients (PN < 500 G/mm3 > 10 days, or immunocompromised due to treatment).

Aspergillosis

           Avoid exposing immunocompromised patients to dust by isolating work areas from care areas.
