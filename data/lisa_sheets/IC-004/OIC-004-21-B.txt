When it comes to patient safety and quality of care, ''transparency'' can be defined in terms of two components:

1.    The "publicity" surrounding the quality and safety indicators for healthcare establishments or professionals,

2.    And the ''declaration'' to the Regional Health Agency (ARS), by establishments or professionals, of the serious undesirable events they encounter.


'''Indicateurs de qualité et sécurité des soins''' (IQSS, formerly IPAQSS).

Tools developed by the French National Authority for Health (HAS):

- Improving the quality of care and patient safety

- Inter-institutional comparisons

- Decision support

- Transparency (user information).


These indicators are subject to "self-assessment" by healthcare establishments:

- Regularly (every year or two)

- When preparing for the certification visit (see below).


A certain number of ''national'' indicators concern ''all care services'', e.g. the proportion of patients with a pain assessment recorded in their file and, if pain was present, a reassessment after analgesic treatment. Others are ''specific to a particular type of care'', e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke or childbirth. Each department in the hospital is asked to look for these indicators in a random selection of files. The quality department in turn checks the elements in a random sample of these records.


The aim is for each establishment to ''improve its results as and when'' these assessments are repeated, in areas considered ''priority'' by the HAS.


The results of these indicators are ''public'', which contributes to the transparency of health establishments vis-à-vis users.



Reporting serious adverse events to the ARS is a necessary prerequisite:

- To their '''epidemiological analysis'''

- Setting up regional initiatives to "prevent them from re-offending".


As soon as an adverse event associated with healthcare is identified, it is necessary to :

- Take precautionary measures to ensure patient safety

- Alert the medical managers and the head of the care structure

- Organising information for patients and their families

- Take the first steps towards understanding the event


The declaration to the ARS is made without delay on the website <nowiki>https://www.signalement.sante.gouv.fr</nowiki><gallery>

(in Comprendre les évènements indésirables graves, HAS, 2021).


A ''supplement to the declaration'' must be submitted within three months and includes :

- An in-depth analysis of the event

- Feedback from experience

- Corrective measures taken or planned.


The ''regional support structure'' can help with this 2nd part of the declaration.
