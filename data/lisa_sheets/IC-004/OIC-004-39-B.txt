In scheduled surgery

- Limiting the length of pre-operative hospitalisation (<24 hours)

- Stop smoking perioperatively (preferably 6 weeks before)

- Assessing diabetes control using HBA1c assays

- Treat infectious sites remotely and postpone until the infection is cured

- In cardiac surgery, systematic decolonisation (without prior screening) for S aureus carriage

For skin preparation before surgery :

- Take at least one shower, with simple soap or antiseptic (shampoo not necessary unless the head is in the field)

- Do not depilate unless there are technical difficulties; if depilation is required: do not use a razor, use clippers or depilatory cream; depilation is not permitted in the operating theatre.

Before the operating theatre :

- Take at least one shower, with simple soap or antiseptic (shampoo not necessary unless the head is in the field)

- Do not depilate unless there are technical difficulties; if depilation is required: do not use a razor, use clippers or depilatory cream; depilation is not permitted in the operating theatre.

In the operating theatre

- Surgical SHA friction of operators, failing which: surgical hand washing

- Operators' clothing: sterile impermeable non-woven gown, sterile gloves (in the case of surgery where there is a risk of puncture, a double pair of gloves), surgical mask, cap or balaclava.

- Air-handling system with filtration of incoming air, air renewal, and maintenance of the room at overpressure (requires keeping the room doors closed and limiting comings and goings).

- Limiting the number of people in the room

- Antibiotic prophylaxis for surgery, if necessary, in accordance with the indications and principles of the consensus conference of the Société Française d'Anesthésie Réanimation (2018).

- Maintaining the patient's normothermia intraoperatively

- Maintenance of blood glucose levels < 2g/l in the early post-operative period.
