Surgical site infection (SSI): infection of tissues located in the path of the surgical incision or at the level of tissues or organs handled during the operation and which occurs within a maximum of thirty days following an operation or, if an implant or prosthesis is inserted, within one year following the operation.


According to the CTINILS, it is classified into two levels according to the following criteria:

1. superficial (must occur within 30 days of the operation) :

§ presence of pus in the incision area,

§ presence of micro-organisms and neutrophils on an aseptically obtained sample from the site,

§ '''OR''' surgeon's opinion.


2. Profound (must occur within 30 days of the operation, or within one year if an implant is inserted):

§ pus from a deep drain,

§ '''OR''' opening of the incision spontaneously or by the surgeon and micro-organisms on a sample from a deep site obtained aseptically OR culture not performed

§ signs of infection (e.g. abscesses) found during a repeat operation, an imaging examination, a pathological examination, etc.
