Asepsis differs from antisepsis in that it does not use therapeutic agents. Asepsis involves preventing the influx of micro-organisms, whereas antisepsis involves inactivating them where they are found.

'''Definition''' AFNOR ''':''' "Set of measures designed to prevent any exogenous contribution of micro-organisms".

Asepsis consists of decontaminating space (including air), equipment and the surface of the body. Asepsis therefore consists of preventing the influx of micro-organisms, whereas antisepsis consists of inactivating micro-organisms where they are found (see term "disinfection").

Asepsis is a method that enables a given task to be carried out without bringing micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) to the patient (or the object of the task). It is based on the use of sterile equipment, sterile clothing, airtight head coverings, sterile gloves, anti-spray masks, micro air filters (very high efficiency filters or VHE) and air renewal systems, not forgetting behavioural rules. The procedures used are known as aseptic techniques.

The level of asepsis must be adapted to the risk level of the task: it can vary from a basic level to a maximum level. Lack of asepsis can cause micro-organisms to penetrate the body, particularly during surgery, leading to HAIs.
