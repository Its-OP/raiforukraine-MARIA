During the last prevalence survey of hospital-acquired infections in 2017, the top 3 micro-organisms found were:

- Enterobacteriaceae E.Coli (25% of microorganisms isolated from nosocomial infections) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%)

- Staphylococcus aureus (15%)

- Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pyocyanic) and Enterococcus faecalis in equal proportions (6.5%)


The pattern of resistance was as follows for each species:

- Enterobacteriaceae: 32% of K pneumoniae, 17% of Enterobacter spp. and 15% of E coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBLSE).

- S. aureus: 27% of strains tested were resistant to methicillin (MRSA)

- P aeruginosa (pyocyanic): 19% of strains tested were resistant to ceftazidime (PAPC)

- Enterococci: 5% of E faecium were resistant to glycopeptides (ERG)
