The Deming wheel symbolises the principle of ''continuous improvement of organisations'', which is symbolised by the upward slope on which the wheel turns.


The PDCA method, which stands for Plan - Do - Check - Act, involves four successive stages:

1. ''Plan'' (say - and write down - what you are going to do)

2. ''Do'' (do what you've said - and written)

3.     '''Check''' (what we have done)

4.     '''React''' (do better)

And start again with a new PDCA cycle.
