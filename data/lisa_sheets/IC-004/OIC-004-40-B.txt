- Restrict venous catheters to essential indications and reassess their usefulness and benefit-risk balance at least daily.

- Choose the right type of venous catheter: peripheral catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line), midline catheter, implantable catheter chamber, etc.

- Aseptic insertion of venous catheters

- Place central venous catheters with surgical asepsis (surgical friction, operator posture, wide drapes)

- For the insertion of all catheters, use a 2% Chlorhexidine-based antiseptic in alcoholic solution for skin antisepsis.

- Protect the puncture site with a transparent dressing to monitor the puncture site, and remove the catheter immediately in the event of local complications.

- Change venous lines every 4 to 7 days at most
