Special precautions, known as "additional precautions", must be implemented in addition to standard precautions when the patient is infected or colonised by certain micro-organisms (see below). Complementary precautions replace the old term "isolation". These precautions aim to establish a physical barrier around a patient carrying a pathogen (clinical infection or simple colonisation) at risk of transmission by contact, droplets or air. The same micro-organism may have several modes of transmission. For example, BMR and BHRe are transmitted by "Contact" (cross transmission by human-to-human contact), SARS-CoV-2, whooping cough, seasonal influenza, etc. are transmitted by "Droplets" (transmission by droplets of oro-tracheo-bronchial secretions) and "Contact", tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox are transmitted by "Air" (transmission by aerosols of small particles).



'''Additional precautions'''
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Type of precaution'''
|'''Main measures in addition to standard precautions'''
|'''Indications'''
|-
|For all additional precautions
|The introduction and removal of additional precautions are subject to a medical prescription, which must be recorded in the patient's medical record.

Patients, their families and the professionals involved in their care must be informed of this process.

Healthcare waste can be disposed of in the same way as other patients' waste.

When there are several cases in the same care unit, it may be useful to group the patients together in the same sector (so-called "cohorting" measures).

|Contact
|For professionals:

Hand hygiene by SHA friction before and after any contact with the patient or his immediate environment, and before leaving the room.

Single-use impermeable apron for care involving direct patient contact

Surgical mask in the event of respiratory infection of the patient with the microorganism concerned (in particular MRSA)

Equipment (stethoscope, blood pressure monitor, etc.) reserved for the patient or disinfected after use

Whenever possible, place patients in single rooms

Dedicated staff assigned to patients only in the event of an uncontrolled epidemic

Visitors must respect hand hygiene but are not required to wear any special clothing.
|MRSA (MRSA, enterobacteria), gastro-enteritis, etc.

For scabies and Clostridium difficile infection, SHA friction must be preceded by hand washing.
|-
|Droplets
|Surgical mask (standard filtration) for carers and visitors on entering the room

Wearing of a surgical mask when leaving the patient's room

Whenever possible, place the patient in a single room
|Seasonal influenza, whooping cough, respiratory syncitial virus, SARS-Cov-2
|-
|Air
|Respiratory protective equipment (usually FFP2 masks) for carers and visitors, fitted before entering the room.

single room mandatory with closed door

the patient must remain in his/her room

if leaving the room for medical reasons, the patient must wear a surgical mask
