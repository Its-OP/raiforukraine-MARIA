The aim of risk management is to reduce the number of undesirable events associated with healthcare to an acceptable level.


The aim of ''a priori''''''' (or proactive) risk prevention is to identify potential risks and try to avoid their occurrence.


It involves five stages:

1 ''Selection'' of the risk situation and organisation of the process

2.     Analysis of the situation and identification of risks

3.     Risk assessment and prioritisation

4.     Risk management (preventive action)

5.     Risk monitoring and ''sustainability'' of results.


Several complementary analysis methods are available:


- Methods based on ''process analysis'': identifying the stages and situations at risk in a care pathway (e.g. by analysing the pathway at the end of a given course of treatment). Mapping processes is often the 1st<sup>rst</sup> step[[Knowing the principles of a priori prevention 2C-004-DE-B05#%20msocom%201|[FR1]].

- Methods based on ''compliance with standards'': quality audit, risk visit, clinical scenario analysis (a team is presented with an event that has actually occurred and asked about the possibility of a similar event occurring within the team: safety barriers present or missing).

- Methods based on ''validated indicators'' (e.g. incidence of nosocomial infections related to the number of days of exposure to risk).


----[[Know the principles of Prevention a priori 2C-004-DE-B05#%20msoanchor%201|[FR1]]]I would have added: risk mapping is often represented by a colour-coded table showing the seriousness of the risk on the one hand and the probability of the event or the preventive measures planned on the other.
