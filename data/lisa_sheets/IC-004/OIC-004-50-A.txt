'''The evaluation of professional practices (EPP)''' is the implementation of methods and tools for improving professional practices, by means of a '''formative evaluation''', in an '''individual or collective'' setting.


EPP consists of ''analysing the clinical activity'' of a professional or a team, in relation to the most recent ''professional recommendations'' available, in order to implement a plan to ''improve'' this activity and, consequently, the quality of patient care.


A PPE includes :

- Choosing a theme

- Definition of the "professional recommendations" used

- The ''method'' chosen

- Four phases:

1.     Measurement and analysis of ''deviation from reference practice''.

2.     Development of "corrective actions".

3.     '''Implementation'''

4.     Follow-up and sustainability


It assumes :

- A ''homogeneous'' patient population

- The choice, in professional recommendations :

o Main elements

o Those with ''potential for improving practices''.

- The definition of quality criteria relating to :

o "Essential segments" of care

o The "objective results" of this treatment (e.g. morbidity, mortality)

- A limited number of ''precise, concise, observable'' criteria

- An "unambiguous" and "context-sensitive" definition of whether or not to respond to each criterion


One pitfall: the quest for exhaustiveness! Concentrate on the main recommendations.
