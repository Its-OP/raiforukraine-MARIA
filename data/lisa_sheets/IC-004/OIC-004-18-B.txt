Five national agencies are involved in health assessment, surveillance and alert:


''' L'Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament''' '''et des produits de santé''' (ANSM) <nowiki>https://ansm.sante.fr/</nowiki> :

- Enables ''access for all'' to healthcare products, including early access for innovative products [[Evaluation principle 2C-004-PC-B01#%20msocom%201|[FR1]]]

- And ensures their ''safety'' (benefit/risk balance) by supervising ''clinical trials'' and the ''marketing'' of health products.


'''L'Autorité de sûreté nucléaire''' (ASN) <nowiki>https://www.asn.fr/</nowiki> :

- ''" Ensures, on behalf of the State, the control of nuclear safety and radiation protection, to protect people and the environment"''.

- '''Informs''' the public (annual reports on nuclear safety and radiation protection), including in emergency situations

- '''Regulates''', in conjunction with the ministry or ministries responsible, for nuclear facilities, the transport of radioactive materials and medical activities (application for authorisation and declaration of use)

- Control (radiation protection and nuclear safety)

- '''Manages radiological emergency situations'''


The former National Public Health Agency (ANSP), now called '''Santé publique France''' <nowiki>https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/</nowiki> :

- ''" Improving and protecting people's health"''
