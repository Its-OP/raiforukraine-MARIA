Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics either by chromosomal mutation or by acquisition of foreign genes via mobile genetic elements such as plasmids and transposons.

Chromosomal mutation :

- It is rare

- its transfer is vertical (from the bacterium to its descendants)

- it concerns a single family of antibiotics

- it is stable and spontaneous in the absence of antibiotic selection pressure


Plasmids or transposons :

- they are frequent (80-90%)

- they are transferred horizontally between bacteria of the same or different species

- they often concern several families of antibiotics (plasmids containing several resistance genes)

they are unstable, and depend on the selection pressure of antibiotics
