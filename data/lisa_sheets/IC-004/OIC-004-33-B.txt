According to the CTINILS, the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia is based on the combination of :

    - a radiological image (X-ray or CT scan) suggestive of pneumonia (if there is a history of cardio-respiratory disease, 2 X-ray examinations are required)

'''AND at least one of the following signs:'''

- hyperthermia > 38Â°C with no other cause,

- leukopenia (<4000 GB/mm3) or hyperleukocytosis (>12,000 GB/mm3)

'''AND at least one of the following signs:'''

- appearance of purulent secretions

- cough or dyspnoea or tachypnoea

- suggestive auscultation

- worsening of blood gases (desaturation) or increased need for oxygen or respiratory assistance

Microbiological documentation is strongly recommended using a protected distal swab (PDP), brush, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), respecting the recommended positivity thresholds (10<sup>4</sup> CFU/ml for BAL, 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/ml for brush and PDP), or failing that, blood cultures.
