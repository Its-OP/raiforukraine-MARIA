Catheter-related infections can be local or systemic (i.e. associated with bacteremia).


Diagnostic criteria vary according to the type of catheter involved.


For central venous catheters, the definition criteria are as follows:

- local infection: presence of at least one clinical sign of infection at the site

of insertion (erythema, induration, collection or presence of pus) and a swab.

positive microbiology (catheter or insertion site sampling) ;

- systemic infection: presence of general signs of infection and/or a positive blood culture, and a sample enabling the infection to be linked to the catheter: either culture of the catheter tip (> 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/l), or culture of the insertion point, or differential blood cultures with a delay in positivity between the peripheral blood culture and that taken from the catheter.

-

In the event of documented bacteremia without culture of the CVC tip or with a negative culture, rapid regression of clinical signs after removal of the CVC makes it possible to link the bacteremia to the CVC.

<br />In the absence of clinical signs of infection, a CVC end sampling > 103 CFU/l is considered to be colonisation of the CVC ans infection. A sample < 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/l is considered to be contaminated at the time of sampling.
