The Ministry's name may change from one government to the next (in July 2021: ''Ministère des solidarités et de la santé'') but its remit varies little.


It prepares and implements government policy in the areas of solidarity, social cohesion, public health, the organisation of the healthcare system and, in liaison with the Ministry of Public Accounts, social protection.


The Ministry is responsible for the ''Conférence nationale de santé'' (CNS), a consultative body that enables stakeholders in the healthcare system (96 members elected in five colleges, one of which represents users) to give their opinions on healthcare policy, and in particular :

- Formulate opinions to improve the healthcare system

- Draw up an annual report on respect for users' rights

- Help organise public debates on health issues


The Ministry is supported by a number of directorates, three of which are described below:


The ''Direction Générale de la Santé (DGS)'' prepares public health policy and contributes to its implementation. It has four main missions:

1.    Preserving and improving people's health

2.    Protecting the population from health threats

3.    Guaranteeing the quality and safety of care and equal access to the healthcare system

4.    Mobilise and coordinate partners.


It is structured around four sub-directorates:

1.    Population health and chronic disease prevention

2.    Health product policy and quality of practice and care

3.    Preventing environmental and food-related risks

4.    Health monitoring and safety


It relies on health safety agencies and high-level authorities, often under the joint authority of several ministries:

- '''Agence de la biomédecine''' (ABM)

- National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM)

- French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES)

- Agence nationale de santé publique or ''Santé publique France'' (French national public health agency)

- '''High council for public health''' (HCSP)

- '''Haute autorité de santé''' (HAS[[Identify functions Ministry of Social Affairs and Health 2C-004-PC-B07#%20msocom%201|[FR1]]] )

- French Nuclear Safety Authority (ASN)

- Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN)

- '''Etablissement français du sang''' (EFS)

- '''Institut national du cancer''' (INCa)

- '''Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale''' (INSERM)

- Agence nationale de recherche sur le SIDA et les hépatites virales (ANRS), which in 2021 will become the ''ANRS / Emerging infectious diseases''.



The ''Direction Générale de l'Offre de Soins (DGOS)'' is a department of the Ministry, acting as the ''interface between the Ministry and healthcare establishments''. Its missions are :

1.    Ensuring quality, continuity and proximity of care

2.    Organising healthcare provision

3.    Organise the training and activities of healthcare professionals (in the case of training, jointly with the "ad hoc" department of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research).


It is structured around four sub-directorates:

1.    Regulation of healthcare provision

2.    Managing the performance of healthcare providers

3.    Human resources in the healthcare system

4.    Strategy and resources


It has :

- Medical advisers

- Healthcare facilities advisers

- Project teams, in particular :

o Strategy for transforming the healthcare system

o Local hospital groups (GHT)

o Territorial access to care



L''''Inspection Générale des Affaires Sociales (IGAS)''' carries out evaluation, clarification, control, audit and change management missions in the field of social policy.


Its purpose is to ''ensure that the compulsory levies paid by citizens enable them to access quality health and social services''.


Inspection :

- Inspects and controls public or, under certain conditions, private organisations

- Control of organisations making appeals to public generosity

- Advises and supports establishments and may be called upon to take over their administration on a temporary basis

- Audits the social ministries and related structures.


Its missions are triggered by ministries, or are part of its own action plan.


Healthcare accounts for around 30% of its missions.

An IGAS mission follows the following outline:
