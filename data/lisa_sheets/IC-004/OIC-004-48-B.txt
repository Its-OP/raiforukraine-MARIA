The '''certification of health care facilities''' :

- Is a mission of the French National Authority for Health (HAS)

- Assesses the level of ''quality'' and ''safety of care'' in public and private health establishments

- Is carried out by ''expert-visitors'', i.e. healthcare professionals trained and appointed by the HAS

- Who assess the school during an ''on-site visit'', by reference to ''national targets''.

- Is '''renewed''' periodically.


The national objectives are grouped together in a "certification reference framework" structured into 15 objectives divided into three chapters (see below):

- The patient

- The care teams

- The establishment


These 15 objectives are broken down into "90 generic criteria" (common to all healthcare establishments) and "41 criteria specific to certain populations, types of care or sectors of activity".


These 141 possible criteria correspond to "three levels of requirement":

- 15 ''imperative criteria'' whose non-validation may result in refusal of certification

- 111 ''standard criteria'' corresponding to certification expectations

- 5 ''advanced criteria'', not yet required but desirable, likely to become standards in the future.

<Each criterion is the subject of a "descriptive sheet".
