According to CTINILS :

The diagnosis of urinary tract infection is based on the combination of :

- At least one of the following signs: fever > 38Â°C, urinary urgency, urinary frequency, urinary burning, suprapubic pain, in the absence of any other cause

'''ET'''

- With bladder catheterisation: positive ECBU > 10<sup>5</sup> microorganisms/ml and no more than 2 different microorganisms

- In the absence of bladder catheterisation: leucocyturia > 10<sup>4</sup> leucocytes/ml and positive ECBU > 10<sup>3</sup> microorganisms/ml and at most 2 different microorganisms.


Specific criteria exist in geriatrics.


It should be noted that asymptomatic bacteriuria is not considered to be a nosocomial urinary tract infection.
