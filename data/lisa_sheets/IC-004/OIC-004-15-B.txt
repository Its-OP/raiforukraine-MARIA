1.    Invasive surgical, interventional or gestural procedures in the broadest sense of the term:

- Of the 6.2 SAEs that occur per 1000 days of hospitalisation, 4.3 are linked to a procedure.


2.    Nosocomial infections:

- 1 in 20 medical patients (predominantly urinary tract infections)

- 1 in 20 surgical patients (predominantly surgical site infections)

- 1 in 5 intensive care patients, in decreasing order of frequency:

o Respiratory infections (15 cases per 1000 ventilation days)

o Bacteremias (including those secondary to catheter infections: < 1 case per 1000 catheterisation days)

o Surgical site infections (between 1 and 5% of 'clean' surgical procedures in the Altemeier classification)

o Urinary tract infections

o Soft tissue infections

- So almost all of them are linked to an invasive procedure

- Mainly hospital-acquired pyogenic bacteria with specific antibiotic resistance phenotypes

- They are responsible for longer hospital stays, repeat surgery, functional sequelae, higher economic costs, increased selection pressure for resistant germs, and higher mortality.


3.    Adverse drug reactions

- Involved in 5% of consultations, 5-10% of hospitalisations

- Between the 4th<sup>ème</sup> and 6th<sup>ème</sup> cause of death

- '''Predictable''' = pharmacodynamic (e.g. hypoglycaemia on insulin)

o Dose-dependent

o Frequent (and therefore known prior to marketing authorisation)

o Avoidable (error) or not (correct use respected)

- '''Unpredictable''' = non-pharmacodynamic (e.g. anaphylaxis)

o Non-dose-dependent

o Rare (i.e. discovered after marketing authorisation)

o "Often" not avoidable

- Must be declared in '''pharmacovigilance:''''

o Online

o ''Obligation'' for prescribers and pharmacists, possibility for other healthcare professionals and patients

o All in theory, but at least the ''serious'' (cf. SAE criteria), the ''unexpected'', and those occurring ''within five years of the MA''.

o Their "imputability" will be assessed on the basis of intrinsic (chronological and semiological) and extrinsic (bibliographical) criteria.

- Have risk factors (see table):

- L''''medication error''':

o Defined as an error at any stage of the "medication circuit": prescribing, preparation, dispensing, administration, monitoring, etc.

o May or may not have consequences for the patient

o Is by definition ''avoidable''.

o Is the result of one or more, usually collective, malfunctions

o Must be analysed to ''prevent recurrence''.

o Must therefore be "declared" (whether or not it has had consequences)
