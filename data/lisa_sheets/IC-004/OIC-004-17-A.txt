- Healthcare-associated infection (HCAI): an infection that occurs during or after care (diagnostic, therapeutic, palliative, preventive or educational) of a patient, which was neither present nor incubating at the start of the care, whether the infection was contracted during a stay in a healthcare establishment (nosocomial infection) or during care provided outside a healthcare establishment (home care, nursing home, private practice).

- Nosocomial infection (NI): an HCAI acquired during a stay in a healthcare establishment, i.e. it was neither present nor incubating on admission. If the infection status on admission is not known, a nosocomial infection is considered to have occurred after the 48th hour of hospitalisation (subject to the usual incubation period for the microorganism concerned).

- Main types: urinary tract infection, pneumonia, surgical site, bacteremia/fungemia associated with a catheter or not. In theory, however, all anatomical sites can be affected.
