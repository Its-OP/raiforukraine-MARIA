Definition of multi-resistant bacteria (MRB): bacteria that accumulate acquired resistance to several families of antibiotics, leading to a therapeutic impasse. They can be responsible for community and nosocomial infections. The most common are Enterobacterales producing extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBL) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Highly resistant bacteria (HRB) include carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (EPC) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE).

The reservoirs of these bacteria are :

- Skin microbiota: MRSA

- Digestive microbiota: ESBL, VRE, EPC


The transmission routes are :

- By contact

Transmission is usually by hand. It can be direct (by hand-carrying) or indirect via a soiled object or equipment, or via the environment.

- By air

o droplets > 5 m (BMR respiratory infection with cough)

o airborne < 5 m (tuberculosis)
