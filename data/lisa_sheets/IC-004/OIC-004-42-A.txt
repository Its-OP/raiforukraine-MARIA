Healthcare establishments are required by law to report certain HCAIs "externally": those that are rare or special because of the micro-organism involved (rare species or resistance), the location of the infection (rarely infected site), its seriousness, or its link with a medical device or procedure that exposes patients to the risk of an epidemic (e.g. defective lava-endoscope). Healthcare-associated infections responsible for a death, as well as clustered cases of healthcare-associated infections, must be reported.

This external reporting presupposes an internal HCAI detection system within the establishment.

Healthcare establishments must report HCAIs to the health authority (regional health agency) and to the regional CPIAS (see above, "Understanding the structures responsible for healthcare-associated infections in France"), after validation by the hygiene practitioner. The ARS then forwards the report to Sant√© Publique France for analysis at national level.

The patient(s) concerned must be informed of this report and the report must be recorded in the patient's file.
