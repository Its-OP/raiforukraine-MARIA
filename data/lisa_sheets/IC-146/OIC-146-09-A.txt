'''Managing injection-related pain'''

In infants and children, a local anaesthetic using a combination of lidocaine and prilocaine (Emla®, Emla patch®) one hour before vaccination. The combination of Emla<sup>®</sup> cream and the sucking of a teat with sucrose appears to be a more effective alternative to lidocaine alone for infants, regardless of its form or sucking alone. Breastfeeding also helps to reduce pain.

Distraction techniques (breathing exercises, songs, cartoons, etc.) can be used with children.

'''Notify a vaccine'''

Record the vaccine administered in the vaccination booklet/health record. Specify its commercial name, date of administration and batch number. Identify the person who carried out the vaccination by u, n stamp and signature. Also note the date of the next booster. Record these same elements in the patient's computer file, if possible with a vigilance alert to facilitate follow-up.

The advantages of the electronic vaccination record (CVE)

<nowiki>https://www.mesvaccins.net/web/media</nowiki>

The mes vaccins.net server allows patients to record the vaccinations they have had, share this information with their carers, and receive an e-mail alert to notify them of any booster shots they need to have. The DGOS plans to eventually integrate it into the electronic personal medical file.
