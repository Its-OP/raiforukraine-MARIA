Premature: Premature babies respond to vaccines from the age of 6 to 8 weeks, whatever the degree of prematurity. The same procedures apply as for the general population, except for pneumococcus, for which an additional dose is given at 3 months. Flu vaccination is recommended after 6 months (2 half-doses 1 month apart). On an individual basis, oral vaccination against rotavirus may be suggested due to the increased risk of severe forms of infection in this population, taking into account the risk of acute intestinal intussusception which seems to be associated with this vaccine.

'''Immunosuppressed or asplenic''' :

*Patients undergoing chemotherapy and up to 6 months afterwards: influenza, COVID-19*, pneumococcus and live attenuated CI vaccine are recommended.
*Transplant patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy: recommended (6 months post-transplant) influenza, COVID-19*, hepatitis A and B, pneumococcus. CI live attenuated vaccine.
