The general population is made up of all the inhabitants of the country, of all ages, for whom a certain number of vaccines are recommended to achieve public health objectives.

Populations at risk (because of their pathologies or age, pregnant women) or particularly exposed to certain infections (high-risk professions (e.g. health professionals, research laboratories, sewage workers ....), living areas, travel) are the target populations for certain vaccines.
