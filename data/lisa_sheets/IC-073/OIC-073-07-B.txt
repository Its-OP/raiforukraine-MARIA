==== Cognitive behavioural therapies ====
Theoretical principles :

- 3 "waves

o Behavioural (1<sup>rst</sup> half 20th century) - classical and operant conditioning: inappropriate learned behaviour

o Cognitive (>1960): dysfunctional cognitive patterns give rise to behaviours

o "Emotional" (>2000): emotional regulation enables cognition to be understood and behaviour to be modified - based on acceptance and mindfulness.

- Practical details

o Functional analysis (study of the problem)

o Therapeutic objective

o Assessment of effectiveness

o Therapeutic contract

o Behavioural method

* Desensitisation: "in sensu" exposure (in the imagination)

* Graduated ''in vivo'' exposure to the anxiogenic stimulus (in reality)

* Immersion (''flooding''): direct, ungraded exposure

o Cognitive method

* Study and modify erroneous thought patterns

* Self-affirmation

* Social skills

o Emotional method

* Emotional regulation techniques (mindfulness, etc.)

* Observation and acceptance of emotions

* Commitment in line with its values

- Numerous validated therapies: ACT (''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy''), DBT (''Dialectical and Behavioral Therapy)'', MBCT (''Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy'')
