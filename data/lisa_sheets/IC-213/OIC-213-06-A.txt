Emergency measures in the event of anaemia with signs of severity

*''Blood transfusion ([[Prescribe and perform a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and perform a blood transfusion]])''' of red blood cells as an emergency in the event of :
**haemodynamic instability ;
**Significant and rapid deglobulation''([[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]])'''';
**Signs of poor tolerance, in particular angina or electrical signs of myocardial ischaemia, lipothymia;
**Hb < 8 g/dL in a patient at risk (cardiovascular pathologies).

*Associated "symptomatic measures":
**Bed rest ;
**Nasal oxygen therapy;
**Placement of a peripheral venous line;
**Monitoring: alertness, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, ECG.

* Treatment of the cause depending on the situation (endoscopic haemostasis procedure, interventional radiology or surgery, and discontinuation of anti-aggregant or anticoagulant treatment ([[Prescription and monitoring of anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant treatment SD-248|prescription and monitoring of anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant treatment]])'' in the event of bleeding, management of the cause of acute haemolysis, etc.).
