== Interpretation of ''mean corpuscular volume (MCV)'' ''([[Anomaly of erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit...) SD-214|anomaly of erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit...)]]''' ==
Anemia

- Microcytic (VGM < 80 fl) ;

- Normocytic (GMV between 80 and 98 fl);

- Macrocytic (GMV > 98 fl).
<br />

== Interpretation of ''reticulocyte count ([[Anomaly of erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit...) SD-214|anomaly of erythrocyte indices (haemoglobin level, haematocrit...]])''' ==
Anemia

- Regenerative (< 120 Giga/l (G/L) or 120,000/mm<sup>3</sup>)

- Regenerative (≥ 120 G/L).
<br />

== '''Microcytic anaemia''' ==

=== Main causes ===
- '''martial deficiency:''' often of gynaecological origin in women during their reproductive period and of digestive origin in men or menopausal women;

- Prolonged inflammatory syndrome leading to sequestration of the iron pool;

- thalassaemias (except minor thalassaemias or thalassaemic traits (a or b) which usually only give microcytosis without anaemia).

=== Tests to be carried out ===
- '''Ferritin assay''' '''Ferritin ([[Ferritin: decrease or increase SD-207|ferritin: decrease or increase]]).'''' Ferritin is decreased in cases of martial deficiency and increased in cases of inflammatory syndrome.

- C-reactive protein (CRP) '''([[Elevation of c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203|elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP)]):'''' inflammatory syndrome

- Hb electrophoresis (2nd<sup>intention</sup> and in cases suggestive of thalassaemia).
<br />

== ''Aregenerative normocytic anemias'' ==

=== Main causes ===
'''= Insufficient medullary production'''

- Bone marrow disease: erythroblastopenia, marrow invasion by tumour cells, myelodysplasia;

- '''Chronic renal insufficiency''' by erythropoietin synthesis defect '''([[Follow-up of a patient in chronic renal insufficiency SD-290|suivi d'un patient en insuffisance rénale chronique]])''' ;

- '''Hypothyroidism''' leading to a decrease in basic metabolism;

- '''Inflammatory syndrome''' (during inflammatory syndrome, the anaemia is initially normocytic and then, if prolonged, becomes microcytic) '''([[Elevation of c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203|elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP]]))''';.
<br />

=== Tests to be carried out ===
- Creatinine blood test

TSH ultra-sensitive (TSHus)

'''- CRP ([[c-reactive protein (cr) elevation SD-203|C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation])''' ;

- If no obvious cause is identified, if reticulocytes < 10 G/L, or if several blood lines are affected (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, etc.): ''myelogram'' ''(interpretation of a myelogram)''' ± karyotype.
<br />

== ''Aregenerative macrocytic anemias'' ==

=== Main causes ===
- Deficiency of vitamin B9 (folates) or vitamin B12 resulting in a defect in DNA synthesis (other cytopenias are therefore frequently associated) and large erythroblasts called megaloblasts, hence the term megaloblastic anaemia;

- '''Hypothyroidism''' leading to a decrease in basic metabolism;

- '''Myelodysplasia''' resulting in qualitative abnormalities of the erythroblastic lineage (and frequently other lineages).
<br />

=== Tests to be carried out ===
- Dosage of vitamins B9, B12 and TSHus

If normal: ''myelogram ([[Interpretation of a myelogram SD-221|interpretation of a myelogram]])'' with karyotype.    
<br />

== ''Regenerative normo- or macrocytic anaemias'' ==

=== Main causes ===
- Acute haemorrhage (but reticulocytosis, and therefore regenerative character, usually only appears after 48 hours);

- '''Hemolysis''' which can be :

o Corpuscular (Hb disorders, enzymopathies or disorders of the RBC membrane) ;

o Extra-corpuscular: destruction of RBCs by a toxic (e.g. lead poisoning), infectious (e.g. malaria), mechanical (mechanical haemolytic anaemia; e.g. thrombotic microangiopathy) or immunological process (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AHAI)).

- '''Correction of the cause of non-regenerative anaemia''', most often deficiency anaemia (e.g. after folic acid supplementation for folate deficiency anaemia).
<br />

=== Tests to be carried out ===
- Look for signs of haemolysis:

o LDH (increased)

o Free bilirubin (increased)

o ''Haptoglobin'' (decreased, often indosable), the most sensitive test for diagnosing haemolysis

- If haemolytic anaemia is confirmed :

o '''Frottis sanguin''' ''(prescription and analysis of the blood smear)''' in search of morphological abnormalities of the RBC:

§ Schizocytes (RBC fragments) in favour of a mechanical cause

§ Testing for parasites (malaria) when travelling to endemic countries

o ''Direct anti-globulin test'' (formerly known as the direct Coombs test), positive for HAI
