== '''Anemia syndrome''' (inconstant and non-specific)'''':'''==
All the signs or symptoms that may indicate anaemia, including mucocutaneous pallor (''Figures 1 and 2''), unusual ''asthenia'', headache, palpitations, ''tachycardia'', functional heart murmur '''(discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation)''', and/or exertional '''dyspnoea''' of variable intensity. Anaemia may also be revealed by signs associated with ''tissue hypoxia'' (e.g. angina ''(chest pain), lipothymia ''([[Malaise, loss of consciousness, convulsive seizure in adults (see item 105)|malaise/loss of consciousness]]), confusional syndrome ''([[2C-131|mental confusion/disorientation]])'').<br /><gallery caption="Figure 1 and 2">

==Anaemia secondary to haemolysis:==
Jaundice of varying intensity (''Figure 3'') may be observed. In the case of massive "intravascular" haemolysis, dark or even "port-red" urine, a "flu-like" syndrome and/or low back pain may be observed. In cases of persistent intra-tissue haemolysis, splenomegaly is frequently observed.
