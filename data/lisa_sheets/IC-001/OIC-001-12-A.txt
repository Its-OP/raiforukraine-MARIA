Motivational interviewing is a method of communication :

- focused on the person to be helped

- used to increase intrinsic motivation to change

- collaborative (carer and patient) and geared towards the goal of strengthening the patient's motivation and commitment to a shared objective


Motivational interviewing is a tool for educating patients, using an approach centred on them and their environment. This education is based on a learning approach. The doctor adopts a position that facilitates learning, so that the patient develops skills within the framework of shared objectives.
