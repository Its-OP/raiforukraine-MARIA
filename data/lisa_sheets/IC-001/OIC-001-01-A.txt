A meeting between a carer and a cared-for person:

- Previously, the approach was mainly paternalistic and biomedical.

- From now on, this will be a global approach, i.e. bio-medical-psychosocial, centred on the patient and not their disease(s).

The patient is a partner in the care process: his or her experience and experiences are integrated into the caregiver's approach.
