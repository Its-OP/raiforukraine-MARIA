Adaptation plays a central role in stress management. In addition to the biological and physiological manifestations of the reaction to stress, the individual has additional means at his or her disposal, known as coping strategies. This term covers all the procedures and processes that an individual can devise and set up between himself and an event deemed worrying or dangerous, in order to control the potential consequences for his physical and psychological well-being.
