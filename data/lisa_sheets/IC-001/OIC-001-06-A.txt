Informing the patient is part of the quality of the relationship. The carer's communication skills are used to shape the information in the service of this relationship.

Factors linked to verbal and non-verbal communication and contextual factors (location, temporality, interference, etc.) influence the information delivered.

A complementary relationship requires the 2 interlocutors to engage in a constructive process of collaboration: feedback influences the quality of the information exchanged.
