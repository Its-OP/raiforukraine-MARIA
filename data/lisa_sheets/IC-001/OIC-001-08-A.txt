|Order=8}}When faced with psychological suffering, people may have difficulty coping and "defending" themselves: they adopt an attitude, more or less consciously, that enables them to cope less painfully with the situation. This is a form of adaptation to anxiety. There is no agreed list of defence mechanisms. The person may, for example, try to distance distressing or threatening cognitions from their feelings (Isolation), displace their mental suffering onto physical symptoms (Displacement), unconsciously project their own feelings by attributing them to others (Projection), regress to a previous stage of development (Regression) or even deny (by unconsciously refusing to acknowledge the traumatic reality).
