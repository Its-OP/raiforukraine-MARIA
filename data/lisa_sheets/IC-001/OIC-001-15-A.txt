Bad news is news that radically and negatively changes the patient's idea of himself and his future. Breaking the news means "letting people know": it's not just a question of providing information, but also of working with the patient to find out what they need to know in order to build a personalised plan of attitudes to adopt in the face of this event.


Structuring the advert in three stages enables you to adopt an appropriate stance:

1. before the meeting with the patient, the doctor questions his own representation of the diagnosis and the certain and uncertain information he has about the disease and the various treatment plans to be considered

2. during the meeting with the patient, the doctor adapts the information to the representations, expectations, experiences and psychological and social needs expressed by the patient

3. end of the meeting with the patient: the doctor asks about the consultation and prepares for future meetings


Announcement means giving patients the information they need throughout the support process. The announcement has a traumatic effect. Most of the time, the patient hears only a small part of what is said. During the initial consultation, not everything is discussed; the patient needs time. In practice: it is essential to give yourself time, to listen, to pay attention to the words chosen and to follow up the announcement.
