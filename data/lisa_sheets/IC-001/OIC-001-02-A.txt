The medical act is the moment when 3 goals converge: that of the patient, that of the doctor and that of society. These goals lead to interactions between the various determinants of the relationship, which fall into the following areas:

- ethics: the respect, dignity and freedom of the individual, his or her group and the community

- social: language difficulties, cultural and even religious factors, level of education, sensory deficits, etc.

psychological: the patient's and the doctor's perspectives at the time of the consultation, and the distancing of life events <br />.
