Adopting an empathetic attitude allows the patient to feel listened to, understood and helped. By adopting a professional attitude, the doctor protects himself from sympathy or antipathy by strengthening the alliance with the patient.

We express our understanding of what the patient is going through: "I understand that this is difficult for you".

Empathy requires a minimum of verbal and non-verbal commitment, and conviction on the part of the doctor in the patient's suffering, for this attitude to take on a caring function.
