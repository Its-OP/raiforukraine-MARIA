Prochaska and Di Clemente have modelled a cycle of motivation to change behaviour that patients can usually follow step by step:

- Precontemplation or preintention: the health problem is unknown or, if it is, the patient evolves from an absence of desire to change behaviour to a desire to do so.

- Contemplation or intention: the problem is identified and the patient plans to change their behaviour

- Preparation: trying to change planning the change

- Action: it changes its behaviour, with two outcomes:

o Maintaining change (resisting relapse)

o Relapse into lack of desire to change or pre-intention. The cycle of pre-intention, intention, preparation and action begins again.


This process shows the importance of identifying the patient's motivational stage in order to adapt the caregiver's approach at each stage.
