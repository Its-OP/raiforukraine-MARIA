The alliance with the patient, also known as the therapeutic alliance, is the result of putting the CPA into practice during successive consultations. Over time, the entire relationship becomes therapeutic, enabling the patient to play a genuine role in his or her own health. The doctor's stance is one of facilitation, encouraging patients to reflect on new information in order to bring about change.
