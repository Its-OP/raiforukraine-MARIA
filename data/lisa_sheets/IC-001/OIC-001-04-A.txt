The patient-centred approach (PCA) is a partnership based on complementarity between the expertise of professionals and the experience of patients, resulting in personalised care (listening, dialogue, adaptation), the development of skills and continuity of care.

The CPA combines perspectives:

- the doctor: biomedical approach, clinical reasoning, diagnosis, treatment

- the patient's experience of the disease

The ACP clinical approach comprises 4 dimensions:

- Exploring the illness and the patient's experience of it

- Understand the individual in their biomedical, psychosocial and contextual context

- Find common ground and a shared understanding of the health problem and the solutions, in order to reach a shared decision.

- Developing an alliance with the patient (therapeutic alliance)<br />.
