Appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication helps to develop a supportive relationship and active listening to patients and those accompanying them. It is estimated that around 30% of a health message is conveyed through words, and 70% through non-verbal communication between patient and doctor (looks, smiles, dress, accessories, everything is language).


Key communication skills :

- open questions (How do you see...? What do you think about...?): the patient cannot answer yes or no. These questions encourage patients to think for themselves, using their own resources.

- respecting silences during the patient's answers or between two questions encourages reflection and gives the patient time to release his or her emotions

- closed questions to which the patient answers yes or no to clarify elements of the interview or physical examination

- reformulations: repeating what the patient has just said, as the doctor thinks he or she has heard and/or understood it, or repeating what the patient says in his or her own words, allowing the patient's reality to be verbalised. The patient becomes aware of what he or she is saying and thinking, and feels listened to and understood.
