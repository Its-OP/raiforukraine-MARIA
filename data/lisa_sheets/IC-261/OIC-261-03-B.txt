'''C. Frequency and epidemiology of the main glomerular diseases'''

'''Nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular lesions (SNLGM)'''

*Main cause of nephrotic syndrome in children (90% before the age of 8);
*rarer in adults (10% of adult nephrotic syndromes);
*predominantly male.


Extra-membranous glomerulopathy

*The leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults (40% of cases), apart from diabetic nephropathy;
*predominantly male.


IgA nephropathy

*the most common primary glomerulonephritis (with no extrarenal cause).
*5th cause of chronic end-stage renal disease in France.
*Predominantly young adults, predominantly men.


Diabetic nephropathy

*the most common secondary glomerular nephropathy
*1<sup>rst</sup> or 2nd leading cause of end-stage renal disease in France.


Lupus nephropathy

*Renal involvement is observed in 40% of patients with systemic lupus.
