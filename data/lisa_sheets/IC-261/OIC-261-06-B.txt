2.        Elementary glomerular lesions

* Three techniques are used to study the glomerulus:
** light microscopy using PAS, trichrome and silver staining ;
** immunofluorescence examination using antibodies directed against IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, light chains of kappa and lambda immunoglobulins, and fibrin;
** electron microscopy.

* 4 elementary glomerular lesions are usually described.
** Cell proliferation: table 3.
** Sclerosis (or fibrosis): fibrous scarring replacing the whole of the destroyed glomerulus (sclerotic glomerulus) or part of the destroyed glomerulus (segmental sclerosis).
** Deposits of immunoglobulin chains (IgG, IgM, IgA, Kappa, Lambda) or complement. Table 4 summarises the different locations.
** Other deposits
*** hyaline deposits (segmental and focal hyalinosis) ;
*** amyloid deposits (Ig chains: AL amyloidosis, SAA: AA amyloidosis);
*** deposits of glycosylated proteins and extracellular matrix (diabetes).

{| class="wikitable"
|Name
|Cell type
|Clinical translation
|-
|Mesangial proliferation
|Mesangial cells
|Inconsistent severity, observed in many pathologies
|-
|Endocapillary proliferation
|Endothelial cells and infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells and monocytes
|Severity during acute inflammatory attacks (e.g. GNA) with inconstant renal failure.
|-
|Extracapillary proliferation
|Parietal epithelial cells
|High severity, acute renal failure, e.g. in rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis.
