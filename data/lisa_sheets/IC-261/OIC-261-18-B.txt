'''F.     Treatment of the main glomerular nephropathies (other than SNLGM)'''

'''GEM treatment:''''

*Progression of primary GEM without treatment:
**25% of cases: spontaneous remission ;
**50% of cases: partial remission with persistent proteinuria;
**25% of cases: persistence of nephrotic syndrome and slowly progressive chronic renal failure;
*Symptomatic and anti-proteinuric treatment.
*Primary GEM with persistent nephrotic syndrome after 6 months of evolution and/or with renal failure should be treated with an immunosuppressant.
*Treatment of secondary GEM is based on treatment of the cause.


Treatment of primary NIgA

No treatment has been codified:

symptomatic and nephroprotective treatment +++ *corticosteroids +/- immunosuppressants are discussed in the most severe forms.
*corticosteroids +/- immunosuppressants are discussed in the most severe forms.


'''Treatment of GNRP'''

*Therapeutic urgency
*Symptomatic treatment (fluid and electrolyte disorders, ARF, respiratory failure, anaemia)
*Specific treatment
**High dose corticosteroids
**Immunosuppressants or biotherapies (e.g. anti-CD20 antibodies)
**Addition of plasma exchange for type I GNRP and certain severe forms of type III GNRP.
*Associated treatments: adjuvant treatment of corticosteroid therapy, eradication of infectious sites (ENT, dental), prevention of opportunistic infections, etc.


Treatment of acute post-infectious GN

 Treatment is symptomatic.
