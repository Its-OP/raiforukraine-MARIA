This is a genuine diagnostic and therapeutic emergency.

The prognosis is life-threatening, taking into account

* pulmonary (respiratory distress, alveolar haemorrhage)
* digestive (digestive haemorrhage, peritonitis),
* acute complications of acute renal failure (respiratory distress due to pulmonary oedema, hyperkalaemia).


There is a significant risk of permanent kidney failure (stage 5 chronic kidney disease).
