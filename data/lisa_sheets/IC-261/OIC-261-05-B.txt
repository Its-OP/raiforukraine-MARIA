E. Histological diagnosis: renal biopsy

1.        Renal puncture biopsy (RPB)

Indications:

Glomerular nephropathy syndrome, with the exception of the following four cases:

*Pure nephrotic syndrome in a child aged between 1 and 10 years,
*diabetic retinopathy on fundus without haematuria in a patient with known diabetes,
*amyloidosis documented on a non-renal biopsy (salivary glands),
*hereditary cluster disease already documented in the family.


Interest :

*Diagnostic value: guides the etiological investigation;
*Therapeutic interest: guides the treatment of certain glomerular nephropathies;
*Prognostic value (depending on the severity of lesions).


Contraindications:

*Single kidney;
*Poorly controlled hypertension (contraindicated until hypertension is controlled);
*Anatomical abnormalities (multiple cysts, horseshoe-shaped kidneys, suspected periarteritis nodosa, etc.);
*Acute pyelonephritis (temporary contraindication);
*Coagulation disorders: questioning +++, CBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), PT, APTT, primary haemostasis study. Antiplatelet agents are stopped: aspirin 5 days, clopidogrel 10 days before the procedure. In the event of haemostasis problems, a transjugular PBR should be considered.


Terms and conditions :

*Look for any contraindications.
*Hospitalization is essential.
*Inform the patient of the benefits and risks of the procedure.
*Carry out a blood group determination and RAI.
*Percutaneous biopsy under ultrasound control.
*Local anaesthetic.
*Two samples are taken for light microscopy and immunofluorescence, sometimes an additional sample is taken for electron microscopy (suspicion of Alport syndrome, immunoglobulin deposition disease).


Complications :

*Acute = bleeding:
**perirenal haematoma (subcapsular) ;
**retroperitoneal haematoma (0.5 to 1%): more or less severe haemorrhagic syndrome;
**intra-renal haematoma ;
**macroscopic haematuria (1 to 10%) +/- clotting of the urinary tract: renal colic and/or urinary retention;
**management may require embolisation or even haemostasis nephrectomy.

*Chronic: arteriovenous fistula (0.1 to 0.5%), murmur, hypertension, risk of rupture.
