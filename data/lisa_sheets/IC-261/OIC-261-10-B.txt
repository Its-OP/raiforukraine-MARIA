'''Evolution/ prognosis: 3 possibilities'''

* Corticosensitivity (80-90% of cases): disappearance of proteinuria. Relapse after discontinuation of treatment in 50% of cases, necessitating resumption of corticosteroid therapy.
* Corticodependence: relapse after corticosensitivity occurring when corticosteroid therapy is reduced or rapidly after it is stopped. Often requires the addition of an immunosuppressant or immunomodulator.
* Corticoresistance: non-response (10% of cases), risk (50%) of end-stage chronic renal failure within 5 years.
