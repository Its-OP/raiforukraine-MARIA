'''B.     Extra-membranous glomerulopathy''''

'''Diagnosis:'''

*In over 85% of cases, there is a nephrotic syndrome which is often impure.
*Diagnosis is based on renal biopsy:
**light microscopy :
***an absence of proliferation,
***normal or thickened and spiculated MBG on the outer surface;
**immunofluorescence: granular extramembranous deposits of IgG and C3.
*GEMs often present with extramembranous deposits of IgG targeting at the same site an autoantigen expressed by podocytes, in the vast majority of cases the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2-R). These anti-PLA2-R IgGs (autoantibodies) are detected in the serum.
*GEM is sometimes diagnosed without a renal biopsy when there is a combination of nephrotic syndrome and anti-PLA2R serum antibodies.

*GEM can be :
**primary (85% of cases).
**secondary (15% of cases): table 6.
