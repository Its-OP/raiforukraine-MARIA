II.     Main glomerular nephropathies'''

A. Minimal glomerular nephrotic syndrome (MGNS)

'''Diagnosis:'''

* the main signs are :
** sudden onset,
** usually pure nephrotic syndrome
** frequent abdominal pain in children,
** complications of nephrotic syndrome: thrombosis, infections.

* However, in children, renal biopsy is not performed if :
** pure nephrotic syndrome,
** age between 1 and 10 years,
** corticosensitive nephrotic syndrome,
** no family history of nephropathy,
** no extrarenal signs,
** normal serum complement.

* Renal biopsy shows optically normal glomeruli, with no deposits'''''''''''. Electron microscopy shows fusion of the feet of the podocytes.
* A cause should be sought (secondary SNLGM): NSAIDs, interferon treatment, Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
* In the absence of a cause, SNLGM (like primary segmental and focal hyalinosis) belongs to an entity known as idiopathic nephrotic syndrome.
