Prognosis of primary IgA nephropathy

* Very variable. As a rule, the disease progresses very slowly''' '''''
* 20-30% of patients develop end-stage renal disease within 20 years of diagnosis.
* Poor prognostic factors are :
** clinical ''':''''
*** presence of renal failure at diagnosis,
*** severity of hypertension,
*** significance of proteinuria,
*** male sex;
** histological ''':''''
*** severity of proliferation,
*** glomerular sclerosis and interstitial fibrosis,
