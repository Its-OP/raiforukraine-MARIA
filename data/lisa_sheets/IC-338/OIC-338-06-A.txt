*Any anaphylactic reaction requires immediate intramuscular injection of adrenaline:
**the IM route allows faster administration than the intravenous route
**adult: 0.5 mg IM, midway up the lateral-external aspect of the thigh.
**For subjects weighing less than 50 kg, the dose is 0.01 mg/kg.
*If at least one life-threatening clinical sign (arterial hypotension, dyspnoea) persists after 5 minutes: repeat IM injection of 0.5 mg (or 0.01 mg/kg for subjects weighing less than 50 kg).
