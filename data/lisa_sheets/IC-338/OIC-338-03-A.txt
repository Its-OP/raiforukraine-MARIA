As a clinical diagnosis, anaphylaxis is highly probable when one of the following 3 criteria is met:

# Skin and/or mucous membrane involvement (generalised urticaria, pruritus, erythema, oedema of the lips, tongue, uvula) of abrupt onset (a few minutes to a few hours) with at least one of the following 2 elements:
## Respiratory impairment (dyspnoea, sibilant rales/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak-flow, hypoxaemia)
## Arterial hypotension or symptoms of tissue hypoperfusion (e.g. syncope, muscle hypotonia, incontinence)
# 2 or more of the following signs within minutes or hours of exposure to a likely allergen in an individual patient
## Skin and/or mucous membrane involvement (generalised urticaria, pruritus, erythema, oedema of the lips, tongue, uvula).
## Respiratory involvement (dyspnoea, sibilant rales/bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak-flow, hypoxaemia)
## Arterial hypotension or symptoms of tissue hypoperfusion (e.g. syncope, muscle hypotonia, incontinence)
## Persistent digestive symptoms (e.g. cramp-like abdominal pain, vomiting)
# arterial hypotension following exposure to an allergen known to the patient
