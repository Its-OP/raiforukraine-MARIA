*Anaphylaxis: severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction, characterised by a sudden onset and life-threatening respiratory or circulatory problems.
*1st phase of anaphylaxis: sensitisation (first contact with the allergen): asymptomatic, leading to the synthesis of specific IgE antibodies.
*2nd phase: anaphylaxis proper (on further contact with the allergen): symptomatic, due to activation of mast cells and basophilic cells by IgE, leading to the release of histamine and tryptase.
