'''Overall, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is still considered positive in women who are symptomatic and/or at risk of osteoporosis in the first 10 years of the menopause or before the age of 60'''.

== Balance of benefits and risks of HRT for premature ovarian failure (PFO) ==
In the case of POI, the term ''hormone replacement therapy'' (HRT) is used.

In the absence of HRT in women with POI, there is an increase in

* cardiovascular mortality
* osteoporosis
* cognitive degeneration

Continuation of HRT recommended until the theoretical age of physiological menopause (no increased risk of breast cancer compared with a woman who is still regulated).

'''All in all, the benefit/risk balance of HRT is always positive in cases of POI, cancelling out the cardiovascular and bone risks induced by early oestrogen deficiency''''.

== Alternatives to HRT ==
Non-hormonal alternatives for the treatment of flushing are less effective than HRT

Several alternatives are available

=== Pharmacological alternatives ===
Certain treatments with a main effect and a marketing authorisation (MA) that is not the management of the functional signs of the menopause have a demonstrated positive effect on the frequency and severity of BVMs.

* serotonin reuptake inhibitors
* clonidine
* gabapentin

=== Food supplements, phytoestrogens, pollen extracts, phytotherapy ===
In general, no proven efficacy compared to placebo

Be careful with phytoestrogens, which are contraindicated if you have a history of breast cancer.

=== Non-pharmacological alternatives ===
There is some evidence that acupuncture, yoga and hypnosis can reduce the frequency and intensity of BVMs.
