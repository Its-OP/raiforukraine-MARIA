During the ageing process, testosterone secretion by the Leydig cells decreases, as a result of a reduction in steroidogenesis as a whole. The impairment is also central, with a reduction in GnRH secretion. In addition, androgen receptors are reduced on the surface of all the cells in the target tissues, increasing the symptoms associated with hypo secretion of testosterone.
