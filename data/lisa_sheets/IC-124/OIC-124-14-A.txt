'''Any abnormal uterine bleeding (SUA) in a post-menopausal woman should rule out endometrial cancer'''.

SUA is an infrequent occurrence (less than 15%) with HRT, and is sometimes linked to overdose or to the resumption of ovarian activity at the start of treatment, but it should be ruled out as a cause of endometrial cancer.

E'''n the case of recurrent abnormal uterine bleeding or when the thickness of the endometrium is greater than 4 mm, additional uterine explorations (hysteroscopy and histology) are necessary''.

=== '''What to do''' ===
- Look for '''risk factors for [[Cervical tumours, tumours of the uterine body|endometrial cancer]]''' on the questionnaire.

* obesity
* HYPERTENSION
* Type 2 diabetes
* taking HRT
* tamoxifen treatment
* family history

- Clinical examination to rule out a vaginal or cervical cause

'''- Carry out an endometrial biopsy using the Cornier pipelle, bearing in mind that it is only of value if it is positive'''

- Pelvic ultrasound to measure the thickness of the endometrium

Diagnostic hysteroscopy for histological confirmation.
