Premature ovarian failure (POI) is defined by

- primary or secondary amenorrhoea lasting more than 4 months

- '''before the age of 40'''

- associated with an ''increase in pituitary gonadotropins''.

Diagnostic confirmation is based on an increase in FSH > 25 IU/l combined with estradiol < 20 pg/ml on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart.

Its prevalence is around 1 to 2%.

Familial forms account for 10-15% of cases, but in 80% of cases no aetiology is found.
