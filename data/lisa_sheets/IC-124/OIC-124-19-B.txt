The effects of DALA can be relatively unpredictable.

== Nevertheless, the first short-term symptoms of ALAD are most often marked by : ==

* sexual problems: erectile dysfunction, reduced libido and even reduced quality of orgasm.
* mood disorders with irritability
* sleep disorders
* vasomotor disorders (hypersudation, hot flushes) usually appear concomitantly<br />.

== Secondarily, in the medium term, there may be: ==

* appearance or worsening of obesity (or metabolic syndrome [[Cardiovascular risk factors and prevention|222]]) with no direct link to a nutritional disorder, and more particularly gynaecological symptoms (reduced hairiness with skin atrophy, non-painful gynaecomastia) are frequent.
* increased cardiovascular risk, particularly thromboembolic risk, especially in very severe forms.
* neuropsychological disorders, which are rarer and usually appear secondarily: loss of memory and attention, or even mood disorders.

== Finally, in the long term, the following may occur: ==

* signs of osteoporosis [[Definition of ageing|123]], [[Know the definition of osteoporosis (densitometry and fractures)|128]] (recent fracture, loss of height), suggestive of the diagnosis
* and sarcopenia (muscular atrophy, reduced muscle strength), which should suggest the diagnosis.
