*The term ''age-related testosterone deficiency syndrome'' should be preferred to the term ''andropause''.

*Its definition is based on the ''association'' of a ''biochemical syndrome'' (hypotestosteronemia) with a ''decrease in serum androgens'' associated with ''advancing age'' impacting on ''quality of life'' and the function of certain organs (Figure 1).
