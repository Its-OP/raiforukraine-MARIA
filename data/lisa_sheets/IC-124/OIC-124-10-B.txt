Before prescribing HRT, it is important to check that there are no clinical contraindications.

In all cases, the prescription of HRT does not alter the monitoring offered to post-menopausal women, which includes at least one mammogram every two years. Additional examinations should therefore be limited:

- Mammogram (less than 2 years old, in line with the recommendations for systematic screening)

- '''A [[Lipid profile analysis SD-195|bilan biologique minimum comportant un dosage du cholestérol total, des triglycérides et de la glycémie à jeun]]''' ;

- Bone densitometry: recommended in the presence of osteoporosis risk factors. In practice, these risk factors are not very sensitive at the start of the menopause, so it can be suggested depending on the patient's situation.

Utero-ovarian ultrasound is not relevant for detecting utero-ovarian lesions in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.
