==From a clinical point of view on examination (Figure 2)==

*The ADAM (androgen deficiency in aging male) Score should be used to assess symptoms as part of the diagnosis of TDS.

*TDS leads to :
**Sexuality disorders: [[Erectile dysfunction|erectile dysfunction 126]], [[Normal sexuality and its disorders|lower libido see quality of orgasms 58]]
**Neuropsychological disorders: loss of memory and attention, even mood disorders, irritability, sleep disorders.
**vasomotor disorders: hypersudation, hot flushes, etc.

==From a clinical point of view on physical examination (Figure 3):==

*Look for (Figure 3):
**Obesity, metabolic syndrome and increased visceral fat.
**Decreased hair growth with skin atrophy and the appearance of painless gynaecomastia.
**Signs in favour of sarcopenia: muscle wasting, reduced muscle strength
**Signs of reduced bone mineral density: recent fracture, loss of height, etc.

==Biologically speaking:==

*Biochemical deficiency'' is defined by a test of total and bioavailable testosterone in the morning (8am-11am) which shows :
**total testosterone < 2.3 ng/ml (8 nmol/l) '''OR''' total testosterone between 2.3 and 3.5 ng/ml (8-12 nmol/l) '''AND''''
***bioavailable testosterone < 0.7 ng/ml
***calculated free testosterone: < 0.07 ng/ml'''
**In the second instance, confirmation of hypotestosteronemia is recommended with a bioavailable testosterone assay 2-4 weeks after the first assay. Total testosterone, SHBG, albumin, FSH/LH and Prolactin will also be requested as part of the complete TDS work-up (second intention).
