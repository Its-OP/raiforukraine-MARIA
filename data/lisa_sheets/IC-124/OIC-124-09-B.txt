== '''Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)''' ==
- correct the functional symptoms of climacteric symptoms (hot flushes, vaginal dryness, mood and sleep disorders, etc.)

- prevent the long-term tissue consequences of estrogen deficiency (osteoporosis, development of atherosclerosis).

It is based on the administration of ''oestrogens, which must be combined with a progestogen in non-hysterectomised women'', due to the risk of endometrial cancer induced by oestrogen treatments alone.

The human estrogen 17ß-estradiol is the reference estrogen for HRT, which has made it possible to remove most of the metabolic contraindications (smoking, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia) to the oestroprogestogenic pill.

It can be administered orally, but preferably parenterally (percutaneously, transdermally), which avoids digestive catabolism and the first-pass hepatic effect, and therefore avoids the increased risk of venous thromboembolism and stroke associated with oral estrogens.

The progestogens to be used because of their better risk profile in terms of venous thrombo-embolic risk and especially breast cancer are natural progesterone and retroprogesterone or dydrogesterone.

== The different treatment regimens ==
Estrogens can be administered either discontinuously, 21 days or preferably 25 days a month, or continuously. To prevent endometrial hyperplasia, the progestogen sequence should not be less than 12 days per treatment cycle. Depending on whether the progestin is administered sequentially or continuously, a distinction is made between treatment regimens known as "with menstruation" and those known as "without menstruation".
