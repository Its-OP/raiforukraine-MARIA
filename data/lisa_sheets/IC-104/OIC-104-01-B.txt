- Disease of young adults (20-40 years), mainly women (3 for 1 man).

- Prevalence: 1 person/1000, i.e. 100,000 people in France.

- North-south gradient: MS is more common further away from the equator

- The causes of MS are multifactorial:

o genetic: Caucasoid population, 30% concordance in monozygotic twins compared with 2-3% in heterozygotic twins, susceptibility genes (linked in particular to the HLA group)

o environmental: viral infections (EBV +++), hygiene, vitamin D deficiency, active or passive smoking
