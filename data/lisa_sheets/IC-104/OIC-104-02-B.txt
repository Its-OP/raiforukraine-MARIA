- Cell-mediated autoimmune disease targeting the myelin of the central nervous system (located mainly in the white matter)

- Focal inflammation, repeated over time, leading to demyelination of areas of the brain, cerebellum, brain stem and/or spinal cord. The axons affected then conduct nerve impulses less well, leading to symptoms and signs related to the location of the lesion.

- Remyelination by oligodendrocytes allowing more or less complete recovery.

- Secondary axonal degeneration leading to progressive and irreversible progression in some patients.
