- Inter-individual variability +++ = symptoms and prognosis are different from one person to another.

- From benign or mildly symptomatic forms to severe forms, rapidly leading to complete dependence.

- Little change in average life expectancy.

- Without any fundamental treatment, a third of patients would one day have to use a wheelchair, while a quarter had a benign course of the disease, compatible with a virtually normal personal and professional life. The other patients, while remaining independent, gradually developed permanent after-effects that limited their activities. Since the introduction of immunotherapy, the disease has become less severe.

- Unpredictable prognosis at individual level.

- Some factors with a better prognosis = young age of onset, initial relapsing-remitting course, long interval between the first two attacks, inaugural optic neuritis, low lesion load at diagnosis (number of T2 lesions).
