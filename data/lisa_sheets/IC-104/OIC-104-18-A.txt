- Optic neuritis, particularly during a first episode, is a diagnostic emergency. Although the prognosis in MS is generally good, certain differential diagnoses with a much worse prognosis should not be overlooked (optic neuritis in neuromyelitis optica, for example, or reduced visual acuity in intracranial hypertension).

Urgent treatment with high-dose corticosteroids should be offered as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed (intravenous or oral boluses of methylprednisolone, but not small doses of oral corticosteroids) ([Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SD-251|prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids]).
