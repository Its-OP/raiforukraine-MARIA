- '''Context''': young subject, neurological symptoms and signs of subacute or more rarely progressive onset, involvement of the white matter of the central nervous system. No extra-neurological involvement. No general inflammatory syndrome.

- '''Dissemination in space''' = clinical or radiological involvement of several areas within the central nervous system

- '''Dissemination over time''' = at least two neurological episodes separated by at least one month; or new lesions on successive MRI scans: or lesions of different ages (taking and not taking contrast) on the same cerebral MRI scan. In immediately progressive forms, a progression over a period of more than one year validates the criterion.

- '''Cerebrospinal fluid inflammation''' = intrathecal secretion of IgG, authenticated by the presence of oligoclonal bands (at least 2) in isofocalisation or by an increased IgG index (greater than 0.7) ([[Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis SD-183|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis]]).

- '''No better explanation''' = eliminate differential diagnoses
