- '''Joint puncture:''' at the time of diagnosis, is an integral part of the treatment (evacuation puncture), and may be repeated in the event of secondary reconstitution of the effusion.

- '''Surgery:''' arthroscopy for joint lavage (+/- synovectomy) not systematic:

           . sepsis / septic shock to rapidly control the source of infection

           . major effusion in large joints (particularly the hip)

           . unfavourable evolution after 5-7 days of appropriate antibiotic therapy, despite repeated punctures whenever possible

In children, septic arthritis is punctured, washed and surgically drained in the operating theatre under general anaesthetic.

           . probabilistic antibiotic therapy started as a matter of urgency after blood cultures and joint puncture, targeting the germs most frequently implicated

In adults: ''S. aureus'' sensitive to methicillin: C1G (cefazolin) or penicillin M (oxacillin, cloxacillin) IV (+ gentamicin in case of sepsis / septic shock)

In children: meticillin-sensitive S. aureus and K. kingae: C1G (cefazolin) or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (+ gentamicin in case of sepsis/septic shock).

           . targeted antibiotic therapy: adaptation of treatment as soon as bacteriological results are received

In adults, in the case of ''S. aureus''<nowiki> sensitive to methicillin: [C1G (cefazolin) or penicillin M (oxacillin, cloxacillin)] IV + [clindamycin, fluoroquinolone or rifampicin] per os for at least 2 weeks, then followed by dual therapy per os (clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, rifampicin, fusidic acid)</nowiki>

In adults, in the case of streptococcus: amoxicillin IV for 2 weeks, followed by amoxicillin by mouth.

In children: can be taken orally after 3 to 5 days if progress is favourable (disappearance of fever and pain). In the absence of documentation, an oral course of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid may be taken (effective against S. aureus and K. kingae).

Total duration of antibiotic treatment: 4 to 6 weeks in adults, 2 weeks in children.
