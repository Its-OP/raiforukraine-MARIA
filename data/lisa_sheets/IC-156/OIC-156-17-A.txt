'''Chronic osteitis in adults:'''

- Location: long bones, foot (contiguous osteitis from plantar perforation, particularly in diabetic patients), pelvis (contiguous osteitis from decubitus [[Escarre SD-086|escarre]])

- General signs very inconsistent, fever often absent

- More or less productive fistula: cutaneous opening communicating with the site of osteitis, with serous to purulent discharge which may be intermittent.

- Painful and inflammatory swelling (inconstant)

- [[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]

'''Special case of osteitis of the diabetic foot:''' complicating a plantar perforating disease

- Variable appearance: inflammation, dry or wet gangrene, discharge, etc.

- Bone contact

- Neurological and vascular assessment essential

'''Acute osteomyelitis in children:'''

- Location: the most vascularised metaphyses of the long bones ("near the knee, far from the elbow": lower femoral, upper tibial, proximal humeral and distal radial ends), in the lower limbs in more than 50% of cases.

- Sudden onset or subacute presentation

- Temperature ≥ 38°C

- Pain responsible for partial or total functional impotence, [[Lameness SD-068|lame]], [[Appearance of difficulty in walking SD-066|appearance of difficulty in walking]]

- Painful metaphyseal palpation

- Increased local heat (redness and swelling at a late stage)
