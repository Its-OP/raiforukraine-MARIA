'''Mechanisms of onset:''''

- Positive blood culture SD-190|haematogenic]]: secondary location in bone or joints during a bacteremia (most frequent mechanism, particularly in children, with infection of the highly vascularised bone metaphyses of the long bones of the lower limbs in more than 50% of cases).

- inoculation: direct contamination during surgery, puncture/infiltration, trauma or a bite

- contiguity: extension of a local infection (often of the skin and soft tissues) to the osteoarticular system (examples: osteitis of a plantar perforating sore in a diabetic patient, or of a decubitus [[Escarre SD-086|escarre]]).
