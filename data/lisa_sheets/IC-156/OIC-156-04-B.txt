'''[[Positive blood culture SD-190|Blood-borne infections]] :''''

- Staphylococcus aureus (cutaneous route of entry): 50-70%.

- Streptococci (dental or digestive route of entry): 20%.

- Enterobacteriaceae (urinary or digestive route of entry): 10%.

- Special cases: ''[[Tuberculosis in adults and children|Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' (rare forms of osteoarticular tuberculosis, mainly vertebral ("Pott's disease")), ''[[Sexually transmitted infections (STI): gonococci, chlamydiosis, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis|Neisseria gonorrhoaea]]'' (rare, often multi-articular forms of gonococcal infections)

'''Post-operative inoculations, post-puncture/infiltration:''' skin flora germs

- Staphylococci (50-70%): S. aureus (50%, including 15% MRSA) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (50%, the most common being S. epidermidis)

- Streptococci

- Gram-negative bacilli: Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa

- Cutibacterium acnes: chronic forms, particularly on the upper limb (shoulder)

'''Inoculations [[Zoonoses|post-bite]]:''' cutaneous (staphylococci) and/or oral (streptococci, ''Pasteurella multocida'', anaerobes) flora

Infections de contiguïté:'' often multi-microbial infections involving skin flora and colonising chronic wounds (staphylococci, streptococci, enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes, etc.).

The main germs responsible for HAIs in children are :

- All ages: "Staphylococcus aureus" (skin entry)

- In young infants under 3 months of age: group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli (think of neonatal infection)

- In children aged between 6 months and 4 years: "Kingella kingae" (most common, ENT route of entry), rarely pneumococcus and group A streptococcus.

- In children over the age of 4: "Staphylococcus aureus" (majority), rarely group A streptococcus (cutaneous route of entry)

- In children with sickle cell disease: ''Salmonella'' sp. (in addition to the other germs involved, depending on age)
