== <small>''Definition and description of psycho-adaptive mechanisms''</small>''' '''' ==

* Psychic operations designed to "protect" the ego.
* Defence mechanisms are necessary to prevent the patient's psychic collapse and are put in place unconsciously.
* They fluctuate and are unpredictable.
* They help to make the illness tolerable and should be respected.
* They allow the patient to construct his or her own representation based on the reality of the illness.
* The doctor's aim is not to get the patient to share exactly the same representation, but to provide factual medical information (in line with what the patient wants) and the elements of understanding needed to draw up a shared care plan.<br /> The doctor's role is to provide the patient with the information he or she needs to make informed decisions.

== <small>''Main defence mechanisms in palliative care''</small> ==

* ''Regression'': recourse to a state of well-being away from tension (minimum effort, tranquillity, freedom, a ''break'', etc.).

* ''Denial'': partial denial of reality (linked to a representation of the illness that the patient has constructed)

* Denial'': psychotic mechanism of complete blocking of reality

* Dissociation: experiencing a drive for life and projects, while at the same time experiencing the deadly reality of the illness and its consequences.

* ''Projection'': anger allows us to evacuate anguish by projecting it outside ourselves onto another object and another motive.

* The displacement: a seemingly trivial concern takes centre stage in the patient's discourse, to the detriment of the illness.

* ''Sublimation'': the ability to create and share something pleasurable from a difficult experience

* Humour: one of the most advanced mechanisms for transforming "the worst desert into a playground".
