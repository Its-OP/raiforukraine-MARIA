Relating to and supporting a person suffering from a serious illness and their family and friends requires [[Knowing the principles of appropriate verbal and non-verbal communication with patients and their family and friends 2C-001-PC-A02|supporting family and friends]] in the same way as patients, but also paying attention to all those involved in care.

==[[Knowing the concept of clinical empathy 2C-001-DE-A09|<small>''The empathic relationship''</small>]]==

*Identifying emotional moments and taking the time to acknowledge them
*Invite and encourage patients to share their experiences in a relationship of trust.
*Identify the patient's emotions and legitimise them by acknowledging what the other person is going through.
*Respect the patient's efforts to cope and value their resources in the face of illness.

==<small>"The accompanying posture"</small>==
Accompanying others requires doctors to be adaptable to individual and sometimes unpredictable situations, constantly adjusting to listen to the patient, those around them and their own internal reactions.

Doctors must be aware of their own defence mechanisms. They must coordinate their support with the work of the multidisciplinary team.

==<small>''The role of family and friends''</small>==
Relatives should be valued: their previous experience and knowledge are necessary for professionals to care for the patient.

With the patient's agreement, relatives should be involved in medical interviews.
