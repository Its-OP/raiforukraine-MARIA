==<small>''The principles of deliberation''</small>==
In the name of [[Respect for autonomy 2C-009-DE-A05|principle of autonomy]], when a person is capable of expressing his or her will, it is that person who takes the decisions that concern him or her.

When the patient is unwilling, unable or no longer capable of making a decision, it will be taken by the doctor, at the end of a process involving personal reflection and deliberation [[Main features of multidisciplinary teamwork 2C-006-DE-A02|collective]] conducted with [[Knowing the different healthcare players and their interactions 2C-002-DE-A07|the players involved in the situation]].

There is no a priori hierarchy between the people taking part in the discussion, on the grounds that the subject of the discussion is an ethical issue.

Deliberation is not restricted to decisions on the proportionality of investigations or treatment when a patient is unable to give his or her opinion, in the form of a collegiate procedure.

==<small>''Stages of deliberation''</small>==

*Anticipate and allow time for everyone to understand the information, issues and consequences;

*Identify and then state the problem (e.g. explicitly question the relevance of the treatment or investigation);

*Develop an individual argument to build an opinion;

*Take part in discussions and debates with the various players involved (patients, their families and healthcare professionals), enabling them to see things from different, complementary perspectives;

*Overall analysis of the situation at team meetings, organised in the form of a collegial procedure for decisions relating to the proportionality of investigations and treatments for patients unable to express themselves;

*Conclude: Take the decision and write it down with reasons;

*Informing the patient and family of the deliberations, while taking responsibility for the medical decision.

==[[Collegial procedure 2C-009-PC-B05|<small>''La procédure collégiale''</small>]]==
If the patient is incapable of expressing his or her wishes, the decision to limit or stop the treatment provided cannot be taken without a collegiate procedure.

The collegial procedure is initiated by the doctor on his own initiative or at the request of the trusted support person, the family or, failing that, one of the next of kin.

The decision is taken by the doctor in charge of the patient, after consultation with the care team if there is one, and on the basis of the reasoned opinion of at least one consultant doctor who has no hierarchical link with the doctor in charge of the patient. The reasoned opinion of a second consultant is requested by these doctors if one of them considers it useful ([[Collegial Decision 2C-003-PC-A03]]).
