==<small>''Clinical and relational benchmarks''</small>==

*Understand the reasons for this request ("why do you want to die?")

*Look for triggering factors (loss of hope, sudden announcement, etc.).

*Knowing how to assess the degree of ambivalence, i.e. the co-existence of opposing wishes, in this case wanting to live on or wanting to die, is common.

*Exploring the temporality of this wish for death (old existential posture or reaction to an announcement, request for the present moment or anticipatory request in the event of aggravation).

*To understand the different reasons for [[The horizon of death in serious illness (psychological and existential approach) 2C-014-DP-B01|Death wish]] (poorly controlled pain and/or symptoms, existential distress, inadequate quality of life, fear of physical and/or cognitive deterioration, etc.) and to manage the associated potentially reversible factors.

*Understanding the request and knowing how to distinguish between a request to limit or stop treatment, a request for relief, a request for deep and continuous sedation, [[Understanding the distinction between sedation at the patient's request, sedation for terminal distress and euthanasia 2C-141-DE-A01|a request for euthanasia...]]

==<small>''Legal benchmarks''</small>==
Be able to propose answers that comply with the French legislative framework :

*Managing symptoms and improving quality of life (non-medicinal approaches in particular)

*Limitation and cessation of certain treatments in the context of the prohibition of unreasonable obstinacy and limitation. Legislative framework, philosophical and ethical foundations* 2C-009-PC-A06|Unreasonable obstinacy]]

*Information on the law's measures for respecting wishes: trusted support person 2C-003-DE-A08|trusted support person and advance directives 2C-009-DE-B03|advance directives

*Information on palliative care facilities (service, palliative care unit, home) ([[2C-139-PC-A01]])

*Possibility of deep and continuous sedation in accordance with the legislative framework in force (multidisciplinary palliative care of patients in the palliative or terminal phase of a serious, chronic or lethal illness, sedation for distress in the terminal phase and specific and complex situations at the end of life, request for euthanasia or assisted suicide).
