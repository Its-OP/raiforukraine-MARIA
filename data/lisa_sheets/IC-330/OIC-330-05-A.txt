=Calcium channel blockers: understanding the mechanisms of action, indications, side-effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure=


These drugs are commonly called "calcium channel blockers", "calcium antagonists" or "calcium channel blockers", but the more accurate term is "calcium channel blockers".

== '''Drug classes'''==

*Calcium antagonists with a mixed cardiac and vascular effect: verapamil and diltiazem.
*Dihydropyridines with a predominantly vascular effect; INN "-dipine": e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, nicardipine.

==''Mechanism of action'''==
Calcium channel blockers bind to cardiac and/or vascular membrane L-type calcium channels. This binding leads to a reduction in the inflow of calcium into the cardiomyocyte (inotropic, dromotropic and negative chronotropic effect) and/or into the smooth muscle cell (peripheral, coronary and cerebral vasodilatation).

=='''Indications'''==

*Hypertension, as first-line treatment
*Stable angina
*Verapamil and diltiazem: paroxysmal junctional tachycardias and certain supraventricular rhythm disorders.
*Verapamil: post-infarction if beta-blockers are contraindicated
*Nifedipine: symptomatic treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon
*Nimodipine: prevention of neurological deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm after meningeal haemorrhage.

==''Undesirable effects'''==

==='''''Dihydropyridines and less frequently verapamil and diltiazem'''''===

*Flushing, headaches
*Peripheral oedema

==='''''Specific to verapamil and diltiazem'''''===

*Bradycardia, conduction disorders
*Heart failure

==''Drug interactions'''==

==='''''Dihydropyridines'''''===
Avoid grapefruit juice, which can cause overdose.

==='''''Verapamil and diltiazem'''''===

*Pharmacokinetic interactions: CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, responsible for multiple drug interactions (atorvastatin and simvastatin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, ergot derivatives, dabigatran, etc.).
*Pharmacodynamic interactions: contraindicated in combination with beta-blockers, bradycardia drugs, antiarrhythmics, etc.

==''Contraindications'''==

==='''''Verapamil and diltiazem'''''===

*Heart failure
*Bradycardia, sinus dysfunction and untethered second- and third-degree atrioventricular blocks
*Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome
*Hypotension
