=Beta blockers/know the mechanisms of action, indications, side effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure=

=='''Mechanisms of action'''==
''''' β-blockers are competitive antagonists of β-adrenergic receptors, classified according to their relative selectivity for β1 and β2 receptors. Some β-blockers have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, enabling them to limit their bradycardia-inducing effect at rest and the risk of aggravating Raynaud's phenomenon.'''''

===''Systemic route'''===

====Cardioselective beta-blockers====

=====Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====
''Atenolol; Atenolol; Betaxolol; Bisoprolol; Metoprolol; Esmolol; Nebivolol''

=====Avec intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====
''Acebutolol; Celiprolol''

====Non-cardioselective beta-blockers====

=====Without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====
''Propranolol; Nadolol; Sotalol*; Tertatolol; Timolol; Labetalol; Carvedilol''

=====Avec intrinsic sympathomimetic activity=====
''Oxyprenolol; Kareolol; Pindolol''

====''Eye drops (antiglaucoma)'''====
''Betaxolol; Karteolol; Metipranolol; Timolol; Levobunolol''

<nowiki>*</nowiki> sotalol is a particular non-selective β-blocker, prolonging the cardiac action potential by inhibiting IKr and lengthening the QT interval. It is used as an antiarrhythmic.

==Indications==

==='''''Cardiovascular'''''===

*Angina, myocardial infarction
*Atrial and ventricular rhythm disorders
*Heart failure: for metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol. Treatment is started at a low dose and then gradually increased.
*Arterial hypertension: Compared with other antihypertensive drugs, β-blockers are equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events, but are less effective in preventing stroke. β-blockers are no longer a first-line treatment for essential hypertension. They are used as first-line treatment in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease, post-myocardial infarction, heart failure and when heart rate needs to be controlled.
*Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

==='''''Other information'''''===

*Chronic open-angle glaucoma: first-line treatment (local administration in the form of eye drops).
*Migraine: background treatment as first-line treatment (metoprolol, propranolol).
*Thyrotoxicosis: adjuvant treatment.

*Treatment of somatic manifestations of anxiety
*Preventive treatment of ruptured oesophageal varices

==''Undesirable effects'''==

*frequent asthenia, bradycardia, cold extremities and Raynaud's phenomenon
*frequent insomnia and nightmares. β-blockers are not responsible for depressive episodes.
*Rare atrioventricular conduction disorders.
*Bronchoconstriction, rare
*Prolongation/masking of hypoglycaemia in diabetics on sulphonamides or insulin, rare.
*Risk of aggravation of heart failure, rare.
*Psoriasis, exceptional.
*Rebound effect on abrupt cessation of treatment: tachycardia, high blood pressure, sweating, nervousness. In practice, doses should be gradually reduced until treatment is stopped.
*After administration in the form of eye drops, absorption through the ocular and nasal mucosa is possible, which may lead to the undesirable effects described above.

==Drug interactions ==
Mainly pharmacodynamic interactions.

==''Contraindications'''==

*Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, the benefit/risk balance of progressively-dosed cardioselective β-blockers in these patients with coronary artery disease is positive, at the cost of iatrogenicity.
*Uncontrolled heart failure
*Bradycardia and second- and third-degree atrioventricular block without equipment
*Prinzmetal's angina
*Severe Raynaud's phenomenon
*In moderate arteriopathy of the lower limbs, the benefit/risk balance is favourable for cardioselective β-blockers.
*Hypotension
