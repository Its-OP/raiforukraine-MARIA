The most common non-opioid analgesics used for several types of pain include: tier I analgesics (paracetamol and nefopam), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and "adjuvant" analgesics (initially used for indications other than pain): antidepressants and anti-epileptics. This section does not cover analgesics that are not or not widely available (cannabis), specific to one indication (e.g. acute pain, migraine, neuropathic pain) (items 135 and 136) or muscle relaxants (see "benzodiazepines" in item 330 and "muscle relaxants" in item 135).

== '''Paracetamol''' ==
The most widely administered tier I analgesic in the world, the reference antipyretic, taken orally, by injection or rectally, alone or combined with caffeine (if combined with opiates, see tier II analgesics), from birth.

==== '''Mechanisms''' ====
Central action still poorly understood (effect on serotonergic controls and probably on calcium channels); no anti-inflammatory effect

==== '''Indications''' ====
Mild to moderate acute or chronic pain, except neuropathic pain (ineffective) Severe pain in combination with opiates

==== '''Undesirable effects''' ====
Hepatotoxicity exceptional under normal conditions (< 4 g/day) (depletion of hepatic glutathione stocks); risk factors: elderly patients, alcoholism, undernutrition, severe renal insufficiency, regular overdoses; renal toxicity and thrombocytopenia only if overdosed; exceptional allergic reactions.

==== '''Drug interactions''' ====
Increased effect of oral anticoagulants (warfarin), increased hepatotoxicity when taking chronic alcohol or enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine). Increased risk of neutropenia if taking zidovudine. Risk of reduced lamotrigine effect.

==== '''Monitoring''' ====
Reduce doses if severe hepatic or renal impairment. No contraindication during pregnancy.  

==== '''Main causes of failure''' ====
Wrong indication (e.g. neuropathic pain). If used to treat headache attacks, risk of chronic daily headaches due to drug abuse (consumption > 15 days/month).

== '''Nefopam''' ==
Non-opioid central analgesic, level I, without anti-inflammatory or antipyretic action. IM or IV route authorised; oral route possible in exceptional cases (off-label).

=== '''Mechanism''' ===
central action (inhibition of mono-amine re-uptake)

=== '''Indications''' ===
post-operative analgesia in combination with other opioid or non-opioid analgesics. Analgesic potency comparable to weak opioids (codeine, tramadol, opium)

=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===
Probable anticholinergic effects: tachycardia, urinary retention, confusion, sweating. Nausea and vomiting. Drowsiness. Convulsions (lowering of the epileptogenic threshold). Frequent, especially if administered rapidly

=== '''Contraindications''' ===
Children (< 15 years), pregnant women, epilepsy. Patients at high risk of urinary retention or acute angle-closure glaucoma. Elderly patients (aged 75 and over): relative contraindication, mainly due to the risk of confusion, to be discussed.

=== '''Monitoring''' ===
Reduce dose if elderly, particularly if rhythm disorders, prostatic adenoma, narrow-angle glaucoma. Avoid prolonged administration.

=== '''Main causes of failure''' ===
Wrong indication (e.g. neuropathic pain)

== Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories ==
Many molecules: ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, celecoxib... oral, IV, IM, suppositories or topical.

=== '''Mechanisms''' ===
Inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 cyclooxygenases: COX-1 synthesises the prostaglandins (Pg) involved in gastro-duodenal protection + pro-aggregating effects; COX-2 synthesises the Pg involved in inflammation + anti-aggregating effects. Both contribute to renal haemodynamics. Pure analgesic effects at low doses and anti-inflammatory effects at high doses. Celecoxib: preferential effects on COX 2 but gatrointestinal risks only reduced (by half).

=== '''Indications''' ===
Acute pain ++ in particular dental pain, osteoarticular pain including osteoarthritis flare-ups, lumbago, traumatic/postoperative pain, renal colic, dysmenorrhoea, migraine attacks; chronic osteoarticular pain (chronic osteoarthritis, low back pain) if paracetamol fails, with prescription limited in duration and stopped if the disease goes into remission.

=== '''Adverse reactions and drug interactions''' ===
++ digestive: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, complications (ulcers, perforations, haemorrhage, anorectitis) especially if age > 65 years, history of ulcer or helicobacter, severe general illness, and depending on dose, drug combinations (corticosteroids/anticoagulants/anti-aggregants), may require proton pump inhibitors (≥ 1 risk factor); renal effects: functional renal failure, fluid retention, hyperkalaemia, nephropathy, especially if : risk of hypovolaemia (cardiac insufficiency, decompensated cirrhosis, low-sodium diet) or nephropathy, elderly subject or in combination with: diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists; skin rash; respiratory allergy (Quincke, asthma); hepatotoxicity; neurological effects (10%) (headache, dizziness, even confusion); thrombotic risk with high long-term doses ++ coxibs and diclofenac. Precautions for use with lithium (increased lithaemia). Contraindications: pregnancy, ulcers, digestive perforation, digestive haemorrhage, renal failure, severe infection (pro-infectious risk), combination with high-dose methotrexate (haematological toxicity).

=== '''Monitoring procedures''' ===
clinical, in particular digestive and renal complications ++

=== '''Main causes of failure''' ===
wrong indication (e.g. neuropathic pain).

=== '''Antidepressants for pain relief''' ===
Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, clomipramine, imipramine) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (duloxetine, venlafaxine). Antidepressants, mood-independent analgesics, anxiolytics, sedatives or psycho-stimulants.

=== '''Mechanisms in analgesia''' ===
Action on descending inhibitory controls by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline. Anticholinergic properties and sodium channel inhibition (tricyclics).

=== '''Indications''' ===
Neuropathic pain; treatment of migraine and tension headaches (amitriptyline); chronic osteoarticular pain and fibromyalgia (off-label) (duloxetine).

=== '''Undesirable effects''' ===
Clinical effects: removal of inhibition (suicidal risk) (initiation); tricyclics: anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, dysuria, cardiotoxicity, sexual disorders, glaucoma), somnolence, weight gain; IRSNA : nausea, anorexia, abdominal pain, constipation, sexual disorders, acute hypertension (rare) (venlafaxine ≥ 150mg/d); biological effects (rare): elevated liver enzymes, hyponatremia. 

=== '''Drug interactions/Counter-indications''' ===
Absolute contraindications (tricyclics): prostate adenoma, recent ischaemic heart disease, narrow-angle glaucoma. Contraindications (all): combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pregnancy, breast-feeding. Precautions: combination with high-dose tramadol (risks: epilepsy, serotonin syndrome). Reduced efficacy of VKAs (duloxetine: CYP2D6 enzymatic inducer).

=== '''Monitoring procedures''' ===
Driving (all). Tricyclics: ECG (initiation), blood pressure (supine, standing), dysuria ++ co-prescriptions, comorbidities or high doses (≥ 75 mg/d). If confused, look for hyponatremia. Hepatic risks (elevated transaminases).

=== '''Main causes of failure''' ===

* Clinical: low doses (no titration) or undesirable effects (rapid initiation).  
* Genetic polymorphism (cytochrome P450 isoenzyme): contributes to individual variability in response and the occurrence of adverse effects.

== Anti-epileptic painkillers ==
Gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate.

Anti-epileptic, analgesic, mood-stabilising (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine) and anxiolytic/sleep-repairing (gabapentin, pregabalin) properties.

=== '''Mechanisms in analgesia''' ===

* Gabapentin, pregabalin: subunit binding of voltage-dependent calcium channels: reduced release of excitatory neurotransmitters.
* Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate: block voltage-dependent sodium channels, reduce glutamate release (topiramate)

=== '''Indications''' ===
Neuropathic pain (gabapentin, pregabalin); essential trigeminal neuralgia (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine); treatment of migraine (topiramate); perioperative context (antihyperalgesic effects).

=== '''Adverse effects, interactions, contraindications, monitoring procedures'' (see item ''antiepileptics'') ===

=== '''Specific monitoring procedures for analgesia''' ===
Gabapentinoids: increased risk of respiratory depression if combined with opioids; risk of misuse or abuse before prescription and renewal.  

=== '''Main causes of failure''' ===
Low doses (no titration) or adverse effects ++ if doses are increased rapidly
