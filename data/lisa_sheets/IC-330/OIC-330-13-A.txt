=Hypolipidemics: understanding the mechanisms of action, indications, side effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure=


Cholesterol-lowering drugs: Statins (Simvastatin, Pravastatin, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin)*, Ion exchange resins (C(h)colestyramine ), Ezetimibe, PCK9 inhibitors (Evolocumab, Alirocumab ) (rank B).

''Le''s ''hypotriglyceridemiant''s: Fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil), Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oils).
<br />

==Mechanisms of action==
===Cholesterol-lowering agents===

*Statins: these HMG Coa reductase inhibitors reduce hepatic cholesterol synthesis and increase the turnover of hepatic LDL receptors. They stimulate the activity of LDL receptors and thus the capture of LDL by hepatocytes.
*C(h)olestyramine*: this is a bile salt chelator. It prevents the reabsorption of bile acids, reduces the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins, and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors, leading to increased uptake of LDL lipoproteins by hepatocytes.
*Ezetimibe*: reduces the absorption of enterocyte cholesterol (after binding to NPC1L1 ("Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1") and SR-BI ("scavenger receptor class B type 1") and increases the expression of hepatic LDL receptors.
*PCSK9 (pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors: promote renewal of hepatic LDL receptors

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

*Fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, gemfibrozil): PPAR (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) alpha receptor agonists, they reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase lipolysis, triglyceride catabolism, HDL production and their return to the liver.
*Omega 3 fatty acids: reduce hepatic VLDL synthesis, increase triglyceride catabolism

==Indications==
The prescription of a hypolipidemic drug is always preceded by 3 to 6 months (primary prevention) or associated (secondary prevention) with a phase of hygiene and dietary measures.

===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===

*Statins: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, mixed hyperlipidemia alone or in combination
*Resin: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination
*Ezetimibe: isolated and familial hypercholesterolemia, alone or in combination
*PCK9 inhibitor (rank B): severe hypercholesterolaemia (homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or homozygous hypercholesterolaemia justifying LDL apheresis), secondary prevention if LDL-C > 0.70 g/L under maximum tolerated lipid-lowering treatment after request for prior agreement.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

*Fibrates: alone in the case of isolated hypertriglyceridaemia (> 5g/L), possibly (fenofibrate) combined with a statin in the case of mixed hyperlipidaemia.
*Omega-3 fatty acids: in combination with a fibrate if ineffective.

==Undesirable Effects==

===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===

*Statins: myalgias (± increase in CPK), very rare rhabdomyolysis (increased risk with inhibitors of the cytochromes involved in their metabolism, such as macrolides including clarythromycin and erythromycin (A, P, S), azole antifungals (A, S)) and increased transaminases (discontinue if > 3*N).  As these AEs are dose-dependent, they are frequently (>50% of cases) linked to drug interactions.
*Rare drug-induced hepatitis, increased risk of type 2 diabetes (pravastatin - RR = 1.1).
*Resin: constipation, nausea, epigastralgia, reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.
*Ezetimibe: myalgias, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, flatulence
*PCK9 inhibitor: rare pain, haemorrhage, haematoma (local reactions) at the injection site, upper respiratory symptoms, pruritus.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

*Fibrates: myalgias, cramps, muscular fatigue ± increase in CPK, rare drug-induced hepatitis (increase in transaminases), increase in homocysteinaemia and creatinaemia, increased biliary lithogenesis in the event of prolonged treatment, skin allergy.
*Omega 3 fatty acids: digestive effects (bad breath, nausea, belching)

==Drug Interactions==

===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===

====Statines====

*with molecules metabolised by cytochrome CYP 3A4 (e.g. atorvastatin) and CYP2C9 (for fluvastatin and rosuvastatin). ): reduced efficacy with enzyme activators such as rifampicin, and increased concentrations with enzyme inhibitors such as protease inhibitors like ritonavir, azole antifungals, macrolides, valproic acid, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone and ciclosporin.
*when combined with VKAs, there is an increased risk of haemorrhage (INR monitoring)
*disruption of the pharmacokinetics of immunosuppressants (less so for pravastatin and rouvastatin)

====Resin====
Reduced absorption of medicines if taken at the same time (i.e. taken 1? hours before or 3 hours after any other medicine).

====Ezetimibe + fibrates====
Potentiation of the risk of AEs and biliary lithiasis

==== PCSK9 inhibitors====
None described

====C(h)olestyramine====
Decreased intestinal absorption of, for example, oral anticoagulants, digitalis and fat-soluble vitamins.

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

====Fibrates====

*increases the duration of action of oral anticoagulants (reduce dosage and increase monitoring)
*risk of pharmacokinetic interference of gemfibrozil with many molecules (contraindication of the gemfibrozil-statin combination)

====Omega-3 fatty acids====
none

==Monitoring procedures==
For all EALs (investigation of lipid abnormalities) at a distance from the introduction of treatment, i.e. 4-8 weeks, depending on the type of drug (the period may be shorter for hypertriglyceridaemia or mixed hyperlipidaemia, longer for hypercholesterolaemia).

===Cholesterol-lowering drugs===

====Statins====
clinical (myalgias), biological (hepatic transaminases and CPK):

*No initial systematic measurement of transaminases and CPK.
*Transaminase assay at 3 months, and CPK assay if: hypothyroidism, renal failure, personal or family history of genetic muscle disease or adverse muscle reactions, alcohol abuse, age > 70 years, unexpected muscle symptoms.

=====Resin=====
clinical (constipation)

Ezetimibe: clinical (digestive disorders)

PCK9 inhibitor: clinical (local reactions at injection sites)

===Hypotriglyceridemics===

*Fibrates: biological (hepatic transaminases and CPK, creatininemia), monitoring of INR in the event of treatment with VKAs.
*Omega 3 fatty acids: clinical (digestive problems)

==Main causes of failure ==
Failure is an inappropriate term for lipid-lowering treatment; ineffectiveness or intolerance would be more appropriate.  Poor compliance with treatment may be encouraged by poor tolerance (muscular with statins, ezetrol or fibrates; digestive with C(h)olestyramine and omega-3s).

Red yeast rice (''Monascus purpureus'') has no marketing authorisation for hypercholesterolaemia but contains variable quantities of lovastatin (non-synthetic).
