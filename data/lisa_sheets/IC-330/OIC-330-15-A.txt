== '''Mechanisms of action''' ==

* ''''' Metformin: inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, increase in peripheral glucose uptake (muscles).

* '''''Sulfonylurea (=sulfonamide hypoglycaemic): stimulation of insulin release by the pancreas.
* ''''' DiPeptidyl Peptidase -4 (DPP-4) inhibitors ''''': inhibition of the degradation of incretins by DPP-4, which allows incretins to stimulate insulin release and inhibit the release of glucagon by the pancreas. The mechanism of action is glucose-dependent, which means that DDP-4 inhibitors do not stimulate insulin release when blood glucose levels are low.
* ''''' GLP-1 inhibitors: an analogue of an incretin (GLP-1) that is resistant to DPP-4, enabling it to stimulate the release of insulin and inhibit the release of glucagon from the pancreas.
* ''''' Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: reduce glucose reabsorption in the renal tubule, facilitating urinary glucose excretion and osmotic diuresis (benefit demonstrated in heart failure).

== '''Indication''' ==
type 2 diabetes ([[Drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes SD-281|drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes]])

== '''Adverse reactions''' ==

* Metformin: digestive problems (very common), lactic acidosis (very rare)
* Sulfonylurea: hypoglycaemia, weight gain
* DiPeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors: arthralgia (uncommon), pancreatitis (very rare)
* GLP-1 agonists: digestive disorders (very common), pancreatitis (very rare)
* Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors: urogenital infections (frequent), sometimes serious (necrotising fasciitis of the perineum), arterial hypotension, polyuria, ketoacidosis (rare).

== '''Drug interactions''' ==

* ''''' Metformin:'''''

drugs likely to promote nephropathy: iodinated contrast products (combination not recommended during the examination and for at least 48 hours after injection), NSAIDs (monitor renal function)

drugs that inhibit the renal secretion systems of metformin (dolutegravir)

* '''''Sulfonylurea :''''

Increased risk of hypoglycaemia: miconazole (contraindicated for certain sulphonamides), beta blockers.

* ''''' DiPeptidyl Peptidase -4 (DPP-4) inhibitors :'''''

Converting enzyme inhibitor: increased risk of angioedema (vildagliptin)

Numerous interactions with saxagliptin, which is largely metabolised by CYP 450 3A4, unlike sitagliptin and vildagliptin.

* ''''' GLP-1 agonists''''': low potential for clinically significant interaction

* ''''' ''Sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors'':'''

diuretic (increased risk of hypotension, dehydration)

hypoglycaemic sulphonamide, insulin (increased risk of hypoglycaemia)

== '''Monitoring''' ==
Efficacy (HbA1c <= individually assessed target) is assessed after 3 to 6 months of treatment, or sooner if treatment is intolerant or clinical signs of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia are present.

== Main causes of failure ==
poor compliance, progression of the disease, intolerance to the treatment
