Pulmonary embolism and/or proximal deep vein thrombosis, as a relay to heparins

For use (off-label) for any arterial or venous thrombosis as a replacement for heparins in cases where AODs are contraindicated.
|contraindicated in cases of severe hepatic insufficiency

==Surveillance methods==

====Clinical surveillance====

*Compliance (particularly for AODs)
*Tolerance: sign of bleeding
*Effectiveness: sign of thrombosis depending on the indication

====Biological monitoring====

=====AOD=====

*Renal function (creatinine)
*Liver function (ASAT, ALAT, gammaGT)

=====AVK=====

*INR (at least once a month)
*Renal function (creatinine and GFR calculation) if fluindione is co-prescribed or prescribed.
*Liver function (ASAT, ALAT, gammaGT)
*Biological tolerance is assessed on the haemogram (to check for anaemia).

==Main causes of failure==
In decreasing order of frequency, factors influencing recurrence or the occurrence of thrombosis:

*Limited benefit of anticoagulants (incomplete reduction in the risk of thrombosis, particularly in AF and prevention in orthopaedic settings).
*Monitoring (particularly for AODs), often overestimated (AOD dosage possible).
*Drug interactions (e.g. enzyme inducers)
*Other mechanisms (e.g. dissection in stroke)
*Major thrombophilia (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, paraneoplastic thrombosis)
*Diagnostic error
