==Monitoring methods==
Clinical monitoring

- Compliance

- Tolerance: sign of bleeding

- Efficacy: no recurrence of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events due to atherothrombotic mechanisms

'''Biological monitoring'''

No specific monitoring to detect toxicity, possible blood crase control (platelets)

== Main causes of failure ==


Intrinsic properties of the compound (partial reduction in the risk of recurrence)

Non-compliance

Insufficient control of other cardiovascular risk factors

Other causes of vascular occlusive disease (embolism, dissection, etc.)
