='''Diuretics'''=

== ''Three drug classes'' ==

[[File:Diuretics.png|vignette|Diuretics]]

*Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide)
*Thiazide diuretics (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide)
*Potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride, spironolactone)

<br />
== '''Mechanisms of action'''==

===Loop diuretics===

*Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NKCC2 co-transporter ["Na-K-Cl cotransporter"] at the level of the large ascending branch of Henl√©.
*Associated effects: renal loss of calcium and magnesium, renal loss of potassium and metabolic alkalosis.

===Thiazide diuretics===

*Natriuretic effect due to inhibition of the NCC transporter in the distal convoluted tubule.
*Associated effects: altered dilution capacity, renal potassium loss, reduced urinary calcium excretion.

===Potassium-sparing diuretics===
Two mechanisms of action depending on the molecule:

*Inhibition of the epithelial sodium channel (eNaC) (''amiloride'')
*Aldosterone receptor antagonist (spironolactone)
*Associated effects: potassium sparing, metabolic acidosis

=='''Indications'''==

===Loop diuretics===

*Edema of cardiac, renal (in particular nephrotic syndrome) or hepatic origin (usually in association with a potassium-sparing diuretic).
*Heart failure in adults|Heart failure
*Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]] in patients with chronic renal failure when thiazide diuretics are contraindicated (particularly when creatinine clearance is < 30 ml/min).

===Thiazide diuretics===

*High blood pressure
*Edema of cardiac, renal or hepatic origin (usually in combination with a potassium-sparing diuretic).

===Potassium-sparing diuretics===

*eNaC inhibitor (amiloride): In association with thiazide or loop diuretics, to prevent potassium depletion; ascites and oedema in cirrhotics.

===Aldosterone receptor antagonist===

*Hyperaldosteronism secondary to diuretic treatment or oedema.
*Essential arterial hypertension and resistant arterial hypertension (after use of a validated triple antihypertensive therapy at the right dose and hygiene and dietary measures).
*Stage III or IV heart failure, in association with a loop diuretic or a conversion enzyme inhibitor.
*Adjuvant therapy for myasthenia to reduce potassium requirements.

==''Adverse reactions'''==

===Loop diuretics and thiazides===

*Hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatraemia, hyperuricaemia, volume depletion.
*glucose intolerance, increased triglycerides
*Immuno-allergic reaction
*Tinnitus, deafness (loop diuretics)
*Hypercalcaemia (thiazide diuretics), hypomagnesaemia (loop diuretics)

===Potassium-sparing diuretics===

*Hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
*Gynecomastia, impotence, menstrual irregularity, libido disorders (non-specific aldosterone receptor antagonists).
*Immuno-allergic reaction

==''Drug interactions'''==

===With loop and thiazide diuretics===

*Drugs that prolong the QT interval '''' (risk of torsade de pointes)
*Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
*Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blockers of the renin angiotensin system: risk of acute renal failure.

===With potassium-sparing diuretics===

*hyperkalaemic'' drugs (ciclosporin, tacrolimus, renin angiotensin system blockers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, trimethoprim), particularly in diabetic patients and/or patients with heart failure, who are at greater risk of hyperkalaemia.
*Lithium: risk of increased lithaemia
*Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, renin angiotensin system blockers: risk of acute renal failure.

==''Contraindications'''==

===Loop diuretics===

*Hypersensitivity
*Urinary tract obstruction, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia
*Acute hepatitis, severe hepatocellular insufficiency (furosemide)
*Pregnancy and breast-feeding

===Potassium-sparing diuretics===

*Hypersensitivity, hyperkalaemia, severe or acute renal failure, pregnancy, breast-feeding.

== '''Monitoring procedures'''==

*Clinical: weight, hydration status, blood pressure, orthostatic hypotension, skin fold, etc.
*Biological: kalaemia, natraemia, creatininaemia, calcaemia in certain patients on thiazides, uric acid, etc.
*ECG if hypo- or hyperkalaemia

== '''Causes of failure'''==

*Refractory oedema: severe hypoalbuminemia, heart failure, etc.
*Hypertension: need for multiple anti-hypertensive therapies
