In practice, sometimes used off-label instead of unfractionated heparins in extracerebral arterial thrombosis, cerebral thrombophlebitis and intracerebral venous thrombosis.

In cases of severe renal impairment (15 â‰¤ GFR < 30 mL/min), dosage reduced to 100 IU/kg/day in a single injection for curative treatment.
Contraindicated in cases of renal impairment with GFR <15 mL/min for curative treatment.

Possible indication for prophylaxis if GFR between 15-30 mL/min

==Drug interactions==


Interactions are of a pharmacodynamic nature with other drugs that act on coagulation

*Fibrinolytics
*Anti-vitamin K
*Direct oral anticoagulants
*Aspirin, clopidogrel and other anti-aggregants
*Serotonin reuptake inhibitors
*NSAIDs (in particular piroxicam)
*High-dose corticoids

==Adverse reactions==
===For all heparins or heparin-like products===

*Information, any site possible

===For all heparins===

*Osteoporosis
*thrombocytosis
*Hepatitis
*Hyperkalaemia
*Hypereosinophilic

===For fondaparinux===

*Hepatitis
*Gastrointestinal disorders
*Peripheral edema

===Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type 2===

*Immunological reaction between platelet PF4 membrane protein and heparin
*Precipitation of intravascular platelets
*Arterial and venous thrombosis (white thrombus disease), sometimes preceded by an injection site reaction or systemic reaction.
*Typically between J4-J14, but early form possible in case of previous heparin exposure
*Decrease in platelets >50% or <100 G/L (often >20 G/L)
*Rare but serious adverse reaction (mortality >10%)
*Rare disease: UFH (>1%) > LMWH (0.1-1%) > daparanoid (10% cross-reactivity in case of HIT) > fondaparinux (very exceptional)
*More frequent in surgical situations (including caesarean sections) or in cancer.
*Risk of thrombosis greater than that of haemorrhage: heparin stopped and another anticoagulant introduced (daparanoid, argotraban).
*Clinical probability score for HIT: 4T score (thrombocytopenia >20 G/L, timing, thrombosis, other causes of thrombocytopenia).

Injection site reaction

Allergy (pain, erythema, purpura)

==Monitoring methods===
===Clinical monitoring===

*Tolerance: sign of bleeding, injection site reaction (allergy, local necrosis, pain, etc.).
*Effectiveness: signs of thrombosis depending on the indication.

===Biological monitoring===

====Platelet monitoring====

*low risk: no platelet monitoring
*intermediate risk: once or twice a week D4-J14 then once a week for a month
*high risk: two or three times a week D4-J14 then once a week for a month

UFH: unfractionated heparin; LMWH: low-molecular-weight heparin; EER: extrarenal purification; ECS: extracorporeal circulation; ECMO: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; CPIA: intra-aortic counterpulsation.

====Biological monitoring of other parameters====
TCA

*Heparin sodium: every day or at H4 after any change in dosage
*Calcium heparin: at H4 if three injections, at H8 if three injections

Anti-Xa (H4 after injection)

*Unfractionated heparins: only if APTT abnormality.
*LMWH: not systematic, in extreme situations (limited renal function, extreme weight)

Renal function

*<LMWH: in high-risk situations (moderate renal impairment, risk of deterioration in renal function [association with nephrotoxic drugs, sepsis, etc.])</nowiki>.

Haemoglobin

*In high-risk bleeding situations

== Main causes of failure==
In decreasing order of frequency, factors influencing recurrence or the occurrence of thrombosis:

*Limited benefit of heparins (incomplete reduction in the risk of thrombosis, particularly in cancer-associated venous thromboembolism).
*Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
*mismatch between galenic/posology and extreme weights
*Non-compliance, particularly in cases of intolerance to injections
*Diagnostic error: thoracic imaging (post-embolic PAH, intravascular tumour, non-cruciate embolism, etc.), ultrasound (haematoma, nerve structure, etc.).
