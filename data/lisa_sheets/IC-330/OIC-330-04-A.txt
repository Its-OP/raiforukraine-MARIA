= Drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system: mechanisms of action, indications, side-effects, drug interactions, monitoring procedures and main causes of failure.

== '''Renin-angiotensin system drugs''' ==

=== '''Two classes of drugs''' ===

* Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, INN "-pril" or "-prilate".
* Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, INN "-sartan".

== '''Mechanism of action (diagram)''' ==
[[File:SRAA.png|thumb]]

=== '''''Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors''''' ===

* Inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II
* Increases concentrations of bradykinin

=== ''''' Angiotensin II receptor antagonists''''' ===

* Competitive inhibitors of angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptors

== '''Indications''' ==

=== '''''Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors''''' ===

* ALL: Hypertension
* Most: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction
* Some: Proteinuric glomerular nephropathy
* Some: Recent post-myocardial infarction
* Ramipril: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with risk factors

=== ''''' Angiotensin II receptor antagonists''''' ===

* ALL: Arterial hypertension
* Candesartan, losartan and valsartan: Heart failure with systolic dysfunction in cases of contraindication or intolerance to ACE inhibitors.
* Irbesartan, losartan: Proteinuric diabetic nephropathy with hypertension
* Valsartan: Recent post-myocardial infarction
* Telmisartan: Prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in atheromatous or diabetic patients with target organ damage

== '''Adverse reactions''' ==

=== '''''Communs''''' ===

* Orthostatic or non-orthostatic hypotension, frequent, take care when taking for the first time.
* Hyperkalaemia, rare, most often in cases of renal failure.
* Acute renal failure, rare, reversible
* Angioneurotic oedema, rare, more frequent with ACE inhibitors (0.1 to 0.5%)
* Foetotoxicity, very serious, exceptional (pregnancy absolute contraindication)

=== ''''' Specific IECs''''' ===

* Dry cough, frequent (5-20% on ACE inhibitors), stops after treatment is stopped

== '''Drug interactions''' ==

* Potassium salts, combination not recommended, risk of hyperkalaemia.
* Potassium-sparing diuretics, risk of hyperkalaemia, combination not recommended except for spironolactone and eplerenone in heart failure. In the latter case, combination under strict control of kalaemia and renal function.
* Lithium, combination not recommended, risk of increased lithaemia due to increased proximal tubular reabsorption.
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: combination not recommended, increased risk of renal failure and hyperkalaemia.
* Loop diuretics and thiazides: caution in use, risk of arterial hypotension and/or acute renal failure in the event of hydrosodic depletion.

== '''Contraindications''' ==

* Pregnancy and breast-feeding: absolute contraindication for both classes.
* Bilateral renal artery stenosis.
* Angioneurotic oedema with ACE inhibitors.
* Renal insufficiency is not a contraindication, but requires precautions (monitoring of blood pressure, glomerular function and kalaemia).

== '''Monitoring procedures''' ==

* In the event of activation of the renin-angiotensin system, there is a significant risk of severe arterial hypotension, necessitating correction of associated factors and prescription of moderate, progressive doses, under clinical (blood pressure) and biological (kalaemia, creatininaemia) supervision: the classic situations are heart failure, intensive treatment with diuretics, severe de-sodorisation, hypovolaemia, diarrhoea or vomiting.
* In patients whose renal function depends mainly on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, there is a risk of severe arterial hypotension and acute renal failure: the classic situations are severe congestive heart failure, underlying renal damage or rare bilateral renal artery stenosis.
* Most of these drugs are eliminated predominantly by renal excretion: consequently, in cases of renal insufficiency, dosage should be adapted to glomerular function and biological monitoring (kalaemia, creatininaemia) should be closely monitored.
* Anaesthesia: interruption of treatment is recommended the day before the operation, due to the increased risk of arterial hypotension.
* Injection of iodinated contrast products increases the risk of acute renal failure and it is advisable to interrupt treatment 24 hours beforehand.
