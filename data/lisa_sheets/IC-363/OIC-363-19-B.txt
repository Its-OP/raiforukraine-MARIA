==''Immediate complications:'''==
More frequent in joint fractures

          Skin complications

Associated lesions

''''Decompensation of defects''''

''' Complications associated with loco-regional or general anaesthesia'''

''' Intraoperative complications:''' tendon section, nerve branch injury

=='''Secondary complications:'''==
'''Syndrome de loge :''' in high-energy trauma. It tends to affect the palmar compartment of the forearm and the palm of the hand.

'''Displacement under plaster:''' the first 3 weeks. If the reduction is not stable

Stiffening of the fingers, especially at the metacarpophalangeal level. Favoured by post-traumatic oedema

'''Carpal tunnel syndrome:''' sometimes early, favoured by the extent of displacement, possible even without displacement (haematoma).

=='''Late complications:'''==
'''Complex regional pain syndrome type 1:''' 15-35%. Oedema, heat, pain, stiffness of the wrist and fingers. Sometimes involvement of the shoulder. Delayed radiographic signs.

'''Cals vicieux :''' favoured by insufficient reduction or secondary displacement with consolidation in a poor position. Extra-articular or articular, radiocarpal or distal radioulnar. Reproduces the deformity of the wrist. Impact on pain symptoms, mobility and grip strength.

Osteoarthritis: related to joint damage; directly correlated with the quality of reduction. The impact on function is variable.
