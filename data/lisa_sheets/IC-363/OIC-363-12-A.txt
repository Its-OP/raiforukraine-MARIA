Pathologies associated with proximal femur fractures

L''''ost√©oporose'': must be detected and treated

Risk factors for falls should be investigated and, if possible, corrected. Management of orthostatic hypotension. Investigation of ''treatments that may contribute to falls'': ''antihypertensive drugs'', ''hypnotics'', ''hypoglycaemic drugs'', etc.

Treatment of vision problems. In rehabilitation, coordination exercises, balance work, post-fall rehabilitation.


Sarcopenia: must be investigated. Dietary management to limit protein loss. Muscle maintenance through physical activity.


In the event of a ''pathological fracture'': treatment of the ''causative disease''.
