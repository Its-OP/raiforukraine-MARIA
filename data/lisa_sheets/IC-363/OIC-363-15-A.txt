The radiographic work-up should enable the "diagnosis" to be made and any "associated lesions" to be looked for, and the criteria for severity to be defined.

The radiographic assessment includes 2 or 3 incidences of the wrist (''Face, profile, +/- ¾''').

Normal radiological appearance: ''mean inclination of the radial glenoid from the front = 25°''; ''head of the ulna 2 mm shorter than the radius''; ''inclination of the radial glenoid from the side 10-12°''.


The assessment specifies whether the fracture is ''simple'', ''transverse'' or ''metaphyseal''; whether the fracture is ''articular'' or ''extra-articular''; whether it is ''displaced'' or not; the ''direction of displacement''; whether there is a ''comminution''; whether there are any associated lesions''.


Associated lesions :

           - Ulnar: distal radio-ulnar dislocation; fracture of the ulnar styloid; fracture of the head of the ulna.

           - '''Fracture of the carpal bones'''

           - '''Intracarpal ligament lesion''' (scapholunate suspected in the presence of scapholunate diastasis associated with an external cuneal fracture)

           - '''Radicarpal ligament injury''' (bone tear)

For joint fractures, a CT scan will show: the different fracture lines; joint relationships; associated lesions.


The ''radiological severity criteria'' are :

           - The '''articular character'''

           - L''''existence of associated lesions''''

           - Fractures considered ''unstable'' in the presence of: ''significant dorsal comminution''; ''associated ulnar fracture''; ''tilt > 20°''.
