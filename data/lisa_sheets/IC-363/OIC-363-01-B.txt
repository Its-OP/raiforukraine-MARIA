Fracture of the lower extremity of the radius is the most common traumatic bone injury, ahead of fracture of the proximal extremity of the femur.

After the age of 40, the incidence of distal radius fractures increases linearly in women.

Fractures of the proximal end of the femur are common, estimated at 90,000 cases a year. It mainly affects ''elderly subjects'', with a strong ''female predominance''. In the elderly, the occurrence of a proximal femur fracture is associated with an "excess mortality of 20% at one year".

50 to 65% of elderly patients with a fracture of the proximal end of the femur have "comorbidities". The morbidity of FH is significant, with "20% postoperative complications" and "30-50% reduction in autonomy". 10-30% of patients become dependent and 25% enter an institution within a year of the fracture.
