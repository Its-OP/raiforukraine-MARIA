Proximal femur fracture :

'''Intense pain''', acute during mobilisation

'''Sitting in a chair and standing up not obtained before surgical fixation'' (or arthroplasty).


In young patients (physiological age <60 years), the objective in cases of proximal femoral fracture is to ''preserve the native hip joint''. In the case of a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture, the risk of osteonecrosis increases with the length of time the fracture has progressed. The reduction and osteosynthesis of a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture in a young patient should be carried out as soon as possible''. In the case of an extracapsular fracture, even a displaced one, the risk of osteonecrosis is low, and osteosynthesis can be performed as an emergency.

In elderly patients, the "delay in operation of more than 48 hours" (calculated from the diagnosis of the fracture to the operation) is the "main factor in mortality". The prognosis of proximal femur fractures depends on the time and quality of the joint surgical and anaesthetic management, as well as on the management of the consequences of frailty and age-related co-morbidities.

'''An increase in the length of time it takes to receive treatment increases the risk of decompensations and the occurrence of complications'''.

Management of proximal femur fractures as part of an orthogeriatric organisation should improve prognosis.
