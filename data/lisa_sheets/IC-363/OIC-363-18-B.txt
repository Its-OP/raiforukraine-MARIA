the two main determinants are the ''direction of travel'' and the ''energy of the trauma''.

== 1- Posterior displacement fractures: ==
In addition to the '''simple extra-articular fracture of the Pouteau-Colles type'', there are :

joint fractures:

                       The fracture associates a pull-out fracture of the ulnar styloid:

                                   Sometimes shows evidence of tearing of the bony insertion of the triangular ligament

                                   No subsequent functional consequences in the absence of distal radio-ulnar instability

                       The rarer fracture combining a fracture of the neck of the ulna

                                   in major displacements of the radial epiphysis

joint fractures

                       High-energy fractures require a CT scan

                       '''Simple external cuneal fractures''' with a simple oblique line facing upwards and outwards: look for associated damage to the scapholunate ligament.

== 2- Anterior displacement fractures ==
Supra-articular fractures (Goyrand-Smith)''''

                       Fork-bellied deformation

                       Anterior tilt of the epiphysis accentuating the anteversion of the radial glenoid

                       Oblique line at the top and front of the profile shot

                       Antero-lateral compression on the face

                       Front end with no engagement

Joint fractures

                       From anterior marginal fracture to anterior marginal fracture-luxation: displacement upwards and forwards or even anterior dislocation of the carpus
