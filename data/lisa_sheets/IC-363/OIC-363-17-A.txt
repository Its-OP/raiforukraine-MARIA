In addition to a full clinical examination to look for any associated lesions, particular attention should be paid to :

== '''Vascular complications:''' ==
- Search for hypoperfusion by measuring radial and ulnar pulses and assessing skin recolouration time.

- Active bleeding

== '''A skin opening''' ==

== '''A neurological complication:''' ==
- Median nerve (compression by haematoma or fracture displacement): sensitivity of the palmar surface of the thumb, index and middle fingers.

== '''A tendon complication:''' ==
- Incarceration of the long extensor tendon of the thumb in the fracture site: loss of active extension of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb.

== '''A large displacement fracture:''' ==
- Risk of soft tissue damage
