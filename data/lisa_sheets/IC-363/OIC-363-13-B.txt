In the majority of cases, the mechanism corresponds to a "fall to the ground" on the hand, with the wrist in hyperextension, much more rarely in flexion.

The result is a ''metaphyseal fracture'' with ''dorsal comminution'' in ''hyperextension'' fractures, and ''palmar comminution'' in ''hyperflexion'' fractures.

The line radiated forwards or backwards is much simpler.

It is ''the comminution'' that is responsible for the ''instability of the fracture site''.

The greater the energy and compression in relation to the strength of the bone, the greater the comminution.

In the case of ''high-energy trauma'', any associated ''intracarpal ligament injuries'' should be investigated.
