The clinical picture is characteristic. On inspection, the patient ''supports his traumatised upper limb''.

The patient's history is taken to determine the mechanism of the trauma. The patient's ''activity'' and ''dominant side'' must be assessed, as well as the time of the accident.

On inspection: characteristic ''bayonet'' deformity due to ''lateral translation'' of the epiphyseal fragment. Back of fork" deformity in profile for compression-extension fractures.

Constant oedema, sometimes with eccchymosis.

Diagnosis more difficult in cases of ''non-displaced fracture'': ''exquisite pain'' in the metaphysis on gentle palpation.

Total functional impotence of the wrist.

Eliminate immediate complications.
