Fracture of the proximal end of the femur may be the result of "high or low energy mechanisms".

High-energy" mechanisms include road accidents, falls from high places and sports accidents, resulting in a fracture of an otherwise healthy bone.

The vulnating force may be transmitted through the femur or have a more direct action on the trochanteric mass.

Low-energy trauma, such as a simple fall from a patient's height, can lead to a fracture of the proximal femur on a pathological bone. This is most often due to "osteoporosis", which is common in the elderly. The proximal femur may also be weakened, regardless of age, by bone metabolism disorders or a primary or secondary bone tumour.

Falls can be mechanical, caused by clumsiness, muscle loss, visual problems, impaired alertness or obstacles. Falls can also occur after an illness (cardiac, neurological, hypoglycaemic, etc.).
