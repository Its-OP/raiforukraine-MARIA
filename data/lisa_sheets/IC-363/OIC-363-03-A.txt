The diagnosis of proximal femur fracture should be made in the event of "any fall in the elderly".

The positive elements of the diagnosis are :  

- groin pain",

- l''''impotence fonctionnelle du membre inférieur concerné''',

- the presence of ''clinostatism'' (inability to lift the heel off the bed surface),

- the ''typical position'' combining ''shortening of the limb, adduction and external rotation''.

Some of these clinical features may be missing, particularly in the case of a non-displaced fracture.

Open skin is exceptional, but areas of contusion may be present, particularly in the trochanteric region. Changes to the skin covering should be investigated.

Vascular and nerve complications must be ruled out by palpating the pulses and checking for distal motility and sensitivity.
