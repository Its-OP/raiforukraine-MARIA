Ultrasound is the first-line examination but has poor sensitivity. It rarely reveals dilatation of the main bile duct or calculi in the common bile duct.  It often only shows vesicular calculi. Diagnosis is based essentially on the transient elevation of transaminases.

Bili-MRI and echo-endoscopy are the best tests for identifying stones in the common bile duct, but they are not used as a first-line treatment.

CT has a lower diagnostic value than biliary biliary MRI and biliary echo-endoscopy for identifying stones in the common bile duct.
