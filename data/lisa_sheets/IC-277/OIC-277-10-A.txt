Lithiasis is the migration of small stones into the main bile duct without signs of angiocholitis or pancreatitis.


The elements of a positive diagnosis of lithiasis migration are :

- the pain of hepatic colic,

- absence of infectious syndrome (no fever) or inflammatory syndrome

- an often significant rise in transaminases, rapidly improving with a reduction of more than 50% in less than 48 hours.

- the presence of vesicular calculi on ultrasound, and generally no dilatation of the bile ducts.
