The elements of the positive diagnosis of acute cholecystitis are :

- hepatic colic pain, possibly associated with right hypochondrium tenderness

- a frequent infectious syndrome (fever, chills),

- biological inflammatory syndrome (neutrophil hyperleukocytosis, increased CRP and/or PCT),

- Ultrasound: thickening of the vesicular wall > 4 mm (triple sheet appearance), vesicular distention and the presence of vesicular calculi.

- Liver function tests were normal.
