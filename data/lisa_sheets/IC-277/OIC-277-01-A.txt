Lithiasis is the presence of stone(s) in the biliary tree formed from bile.
It may be located in the gallbladder and/or in the main bile duct.

Hepatic colic is pain associated with sudden tension in the bile ducts, caused by the transient blockage of a stone, either in the cystic duct or in the main bile duct.

Acute cholecystitis is an acute infection of the gallbladder. Acute lithiasis cholecystitis is caused by prolonged obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone.

Angiocholitis is a bacterial infection of the main biliary tract, generally caused by a stone lodged in the ampulla of Vater (hepato-pancreatic ampulla).

Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas caused by the migration of a gallstone into the ampulla of Vater.
