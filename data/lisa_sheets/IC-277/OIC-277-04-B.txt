The most frequent complications of vesicular lithiasis are :

- hepatic colic,

- cholecystitis,

- lithiasis migration,

- lithiasis of the main duct,

- angiocholitis,

- acute pancreatitis.

There are rarer complications such as biliary ileus (occlusion of the small intestine by migration of a large gallstone lodged in Bauhin's valve, secondary to a choledochoduodenal fistula).


Hepatic colic is pain associated with sudden tension in the bile ducts, caused by the transient blockage of a stone, either in the cystic duct or in the main bile duct.

Acute "lithiasis" cholecystitis is an acute infection of the gallbladder caused by prolonged obstruction of the cystic duct by a stone.

The other complications (lithiasis of the main bile duct, lithiasis migration, angiocholitis, acute pancreatitis) are linked to the migration of a vesicular calculus into the main bile duct:
 
- Main bile duct lithiasis is an obstruction of the main bile duct in the absence of infection or pancreatitis. It may be responsible for jaundice in cases of prolonged obstruction of the ductal lumen.

- Angiocholitis is a bacterial infection of the main biliary tract, generally due to the impaction of a stone in the ampulla of Vater (hepato-pancreatic ampulla). Angiocholitis can be complicated by liver abscesses, septic shock and multiple organ failure leading to death.

- Acute pancreatitis is an acute inflammation of the pancreas caused by the migration of a gallstone into the ampulla of Vater.
