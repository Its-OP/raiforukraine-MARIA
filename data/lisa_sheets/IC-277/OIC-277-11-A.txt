The elements of the positive diagnosis of acute angiocholitis are typically but inconstantly the triad of biliary pain - fever - jaundice, appearing successively in 48 hours.

When the characteristic triad is not present, the arguments in favour of the diagnosis are the combination of cholestasis (icteric or not) and an inflammatory or infectious syndrome.

An ultrasound scan is performed as a first line of defence, to look for vesicular lithiasis and dilatation of the bile ducts (inconstant).

In the event of a non-contributory ultrasound scan, an abdominal CT scan without and with injection is recommended.

MRI and/or echo-endoscopy may be discussed in 3rd line.
