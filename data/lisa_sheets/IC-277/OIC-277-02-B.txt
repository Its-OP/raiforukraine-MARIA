The incidence of vesicular calculosis in Western countries is around 20% of the general population. It increases with age, reaching 60% after the age of 80. Eighty per cent of individuals with vesicular calculosis are asymptomatic.

Despite its frequency, screening for vesicular lithiasis is not indicated. In fact, the cumulative probability of a complication from vesicular lithiasis is 20%.
