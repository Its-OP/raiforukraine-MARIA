In the event of severe sepsis or septic shock in the setting of angiocholitis, resuscitative management measures are urgently required:

- optimising the circulatory system (filling, vasopressor amines if necessary),

- antibiotic therapy without delay after bacteriological sampling, management of any associated organ dysfunctions)

- endoscopic biliary unblocking is preferred. If this is not available or fails, percutaneous drainage may be proposed.

- Biliary deobstruction can only be considered after the resuscitative management described above.
