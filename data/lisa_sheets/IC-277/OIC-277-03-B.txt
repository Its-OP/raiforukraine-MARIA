'''The 2 main types of gallstones are: cholesterotic (80%) and pigmentary (20%).'''


Biliary cholesterol lithiasis is due to an increase in the concentration of cholesterol in the bile, with supersaturation of the bile with cholesterol, followed by lithiasis precipitation.

The main risk factors for cholestatic biliary lithiasis are :

- age

- the female sex

- overweight (obesity)

- pregnancy

- prolonged fasting and parenteral nutrition

- history of gastrectomy or bypass surgery

- certain drugs (oestrogens, fibrates, somatostatin analogues)


Pigment lithiasis is due to precipitation of unconjugated bilirubin, which is insoluble.

The risk factors for pigment lithiasis are :

- increased bilirubin production (haemolysis, sickle cell disease and thalassaemia)

- biliary obstacles

- chronic biliary infections
