The principles of treatment for acute angiocholitis are :

- analgesic treatment

- first-line broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for digestive tract germs, with secondary adaptation to an antibiotic susceptibility test

- emergency clearance of the bile duct (by endoscopy or radiology).

Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography (ERCP) is an interventional endoscopic procedure performed under general anaesthetic using dedicated endoscopic equipment (side-view duodenoscope).

ERCP allows the main bile duct to be accessed, followed by endoscopic sphincterotomy before instrumental extraction of the stone.

- cholecystectomy:
Secondary cholecystectomy depends on the patient's condition (physiological age) and the presence or absence of cholecystitis.
