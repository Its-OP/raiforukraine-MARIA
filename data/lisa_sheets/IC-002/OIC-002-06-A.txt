The ''code of ethics'' defines the standards to be applied by the profession, i.e. the principles that enable practice in line with professional values. It is drafted by the Ordre National des Médecins, submitted to the Conseil d'Etat, to Parliament (vote), published in the Journal Officiel and incorporated into the Code de Santé Publique.

A ''conflict of values'' arises when care involves values which tend to lead to divergent decisions, for example the protection of life and respect for the autonomy of a patient who wishes to die. The term "conflict of interest" is used when the professional's judgement is potentially influenced by an interest other than that of the patient or society, such as financial gain.
