Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promotes the practice of medicine in accordance with current scientific data, interpreted in the light of personal experience and applied with respect for the patient's preferences and values.

Medicine based on the patient's responsibility and experience" takes note of the patient's practical skills and day-to-day experience of illness. This experience gives patients the right to take part in treatment decisions, thereby giving them a sense of responsibility. Patients' rights have been strengthened, and shared decision-making is advocated as a relational ideal.
