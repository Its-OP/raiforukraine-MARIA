Professional orders are the regulatory bodies for the regulated professions: doctors, pharmacists, midwives, dental surgeons, nurses, masseurs, physiotherapists and chiropodists. The orders ensure that the principles of morality, probity and competence, which are essential to professional practice, are upheld, that professional rights, duties and obligations are respected, and that professional relations are based on mutual trust.
