The diagnostic strategy focuses on differentiating between Raynaud's disease (primary RA) and secondary RA. Primary RA is the most common (4 out of 5 cases).

Clinical examination, in search of arguments to cast doubt on the primary origin of the RA. The clinical features that raise the suspicion of secondary RA are :

*male sex;
* onset after the age of 40
* absence of summer remission;
* no family history of RA;
* Involvement of the thumbs;
* unilateral;
*digital ulcers (or retractile scars ('''''[[Abnormal scar SD-083|abnormal scar]]''''') of digital ulcers ('''''[[Skin ulcer SD-092|skin ulcer]])''''' ;
* abolition of a pulse ;
*a pathological Allen manoeuvre.

As well as:

- clinical features suggestive of scleroderma: telangiectasia, sclerodactyly, subcutaneous calcinosis, pyrosis, etc.

- occupational exposure to vibrating machinery or repetitive hand trauma '''''([[Prévention des risques professionnels SD-315|prevention of occupational risks]]'')'',

- iatrogenic effects of a drug or toxic treatment (e.g. tryptans, β-blockers, clonidine....) ( '''''[[Voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug SD-340|voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic or potentially toxic drug]]; [[Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care SD-348|suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or care]]'').'''''
