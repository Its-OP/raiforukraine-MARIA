The diagnosis is based on a combination of anatomopathological and serological criteria.

On upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the appearance of villous atrophy of the duodenum is suggestive. Multiple biopsies are taken from this area. The 4 key anatomopathological signs are an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes, total or subtotal villous atrophy, crypt hypertrophy and a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate of the chorion.

Anti-transglutaminase IgA antibodies (weighted IgA assay concomitant with the possibility of associated IgA deficiency) are almost always present. They are highly sensitive and very specific.
