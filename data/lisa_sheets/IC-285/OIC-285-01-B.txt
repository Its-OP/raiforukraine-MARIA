'''<u>Functional causes</u>''''

Most common causes of chronic diarrhoea

* irritable bowel or "trotter's diarrhoea", 6 months-3 years, requires no further examination, recovers with change in diet (limit fermentable sugar)
* irritable bowel in older children and adolescents = same presentation as in adults

'''<u>Organic causes</u>''''

Different causes depending on age

For infants and young children

* in infants: allergy to cow's milk proteins = delayed allergy (non-IgE mediated)
** onset after the introduction of cow's milk (exceptional in breast-fed infants)
** sometimes accompanied by other signs of delayed allergy such as eczema
** diagnosis: avoidance reintroduction, no assessment
** treatment = avoidance diet for several months
* celiac disease
** clinical: weight loss or stagnation, bloating, abdominal pain, signs of malnutrition (amyotrophy), impact on development
** diagnosis :
*** anti-transglutaminase IgA (subject to gluten consumption) + total IgA
*** intestinal biopsy
** treatment: avoidance
* cystic fibrosis (specific genetic diseases)
* parasitic causes: giardiasis

For older children and adolescents

* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
* celiac disease
* secondary lactose intolerance (> 5 years)
