Typical cases associate postprandial abdominal pain and diarrhoea due to malabsorption, the severity being linked to the severity of the associated deficiencies. In children, the presence of a break in the staturo-weight curve should raise the suspicion of coeliac disease.

Apart from these typical forms, there are many pauci-symptomatic (diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome) or even asymptomatic cases. Anemia due to martial deficiency has become one of the most frequent diagnostic circumstances. Diagnosis may be difficult, or may occur as a complication of the intestinal disease or an extra-intestinal complication, with dermatitis herpetiformis (rare) being the most typical. Other autoimmune diseases are frequently associated with coeliac disease (type 1 diabetes, Biermer's disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, etc.). There may be liver abnormalities with no cause other than coeliac disease, which disappear on a gluten-free diet.
