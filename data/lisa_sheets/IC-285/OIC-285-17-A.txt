'''The treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet'', totally excluding foods containing gluten (rye, wheat, barley). This diet, which is difficult to follow and sometimes feels like social exclusion in the event of a late diagnosis, must be accompanied by a dietician. It is important to provide patients with contact details for patient associations.

It is not a disease recognised by the ALD. Once declared to the social security system, patients can claim monthly financial assistance for the purchase of gluten-free food products.

Deficiencies must be investigated and corrected, particularly when the disease is diagnosed. Osteoporosis should be investigated by bone densitometry (50% incidence at diagnosis in adults) and treated.
