The stools are liquid, often accompanied by abdominal pain due to meteorism with borborygms and flatulence.

For example, the diarrhoea associated with lactose intolerance is secondary to a lactase deficiency, and symptoms are triggered by the intake of milk products. Lactose acts as an osmotic substance and is fermented by colonic bacteria. Diagnosis is theoretically confirmed by a lactose breath test, but in practice the diagnostic test is the cessation of diarrhoea on stopping cow's milk, which can be replaced by lactose-free milk. Sources of lactose other than milk are generally well tolerated because they contain less lactose.

Intolerance to FODMAPs (see item 284) is also a cause of osmotic diarrhoea.

Other causes of osmotic diarrhoea are rarer, either iatrogenic or taken without the patient's knowledge: mannitol, sorbitol (sweets, chewing gum), osmotic laxatives, magnesium, antacids (magnesia oxide and hydroxide).
