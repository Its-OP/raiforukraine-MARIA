The majority of GERDs are uncomplicated. Approximately 60% of "symptomatic" GERD is not complicated by oesophagitis.

- Oesophagitis: endoscopic diagnosis (ulcerations of the oesophageal mucosa); endoscopy is used to assess the severity of oesophagitis (less than 5% of severe forms).

The Los Angeles classification enables the severity of oesophageal damage to be assessed endoscopically. There is no parallel between the intensity of symptoms and the severity of endoscopic damage.

- Digestive haemorrhage: oesophageal ulcers may bleed, causing haematemesis, melena or anaemia due to martial deficiency. This is a complication of ulcerated oesophagitis.

- Peptic stenosis is a complication of long-standing GERD that is often overlooked. The most common symptoms are dysphagia and weight loss.

- Endobrachyoesophagus or Barrett's oesophagus: transformation of the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus into intestinal-type glandular epithelium (intestinal metaplasia). This is a precancerous state predisposing to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis is made endoscopically and confirmed by anatomopathological examination of biopsies of the abnormal oesophageal mucosa (intestinal metaplasia). The degree of involvement and the presence of low- or high-grade dysplasia determine the endoscopic surveillance and treatment methods.

- Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus: consequence of a process of carcinogenesis with low then high grade dysplasia before transformation into adenocarcinoma of Barrett's oesophagus (less than 1% per year).

- Alterations in quality of life and sleep that are often overlooked (nocturnal GERD creates micro-awakenings and impairs quality of life and performance at work)
