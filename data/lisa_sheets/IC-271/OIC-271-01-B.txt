Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common and overwhelmingly benign: 10% of the general population report one episode of pyrosis per week, and 2 to 5% daily.

Obesity is the main risk factor for GERD. Other risk factors include hiatal hernia, pregnancy, alcohol, certain bariatric surgeries and certain medications (e.g. nitrates).
