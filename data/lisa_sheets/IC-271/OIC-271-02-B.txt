Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the intermittent passage of part of the gastric contents into the [[Anatomy:Oesophagus|oesophagus]].

This upwelling occurs without any effort to vomit. This definition is "functional" and implies that not all refluxes are symptomatic or acidic.

A distinction must be made between "physiological" GERD (which causes no symptoms or mucosal damage) and "pathological" GERD. Pathological" GERD is characterised by symptoms and/or mucosal lesions (oesophagitis, stenosis, Barrett's oesophagus). In this text, the term GERD is to be understood as "pathological" GERD.


'''Pathophysiology is multifactorial'''

-Attack by gastric fluid, against which the oesophageal mucosa is not protected

-Alteration of the anti-reflux barrier formed by the lower sphincter of the [[Anatomy:Oesophagus|oesophagus]]: hypotonia of the lower sphincter of the oesophagus and '''abnormal increase in Transient Relaxations of the Lower Sphincter of the Oesophagus.'''

-Increased abdominal pressure: anything that "weighs down/presses" on the abdomen will encourage reflux (e.g. coughing, tight clothing, etc.).

Stasis of gastric contents (high-fat, high-calorie meals; gastroparesis)

-Decreased diaphragmatic support function, particularly in cases of hiatal hernia. Hiatal hernias are anatomically defined as protrusions of gastric segments through the oesophageal diaphragmatic hiatus.

   There are 2 types, differing in anatomy, frequency and consequences:

'''Hiatal hernia by sliding:'''

- ascent of the cardia through the oesophageal hiatus

- most frequent form

       (85% of hernias)

- can be accompanied by GERD

'''Hiatal hernia by rolling:'''

- herniation of the greater tuberosity:

     its location is para-oesophageal

- Less frequent form (15%)

- can manifest itself as dysphagia

- can be complicated by strangulation

- is not accompanied by GERD


These two forms can be combined to form a mixed form

'''VERY IMPORTANT: not all hiatal hernias are complicated by GERD'''
