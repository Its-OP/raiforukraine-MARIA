The diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is most often clinical and relies mainly on questioning to look for typical and atypical signs.

A. ''Typical'' GERD combines the following 3 signs:

1) Pyrosis (most characteristic sign): sensation of ascending retrosternal burning (Specificity: 90%)

2) Regurgitation: acidic, biliary and/or alimentary gastric contents flowing back into the mouth without effort or nausea.

3) Postural syndrome: signs 1 and 2 favoured by decubitus (nocturnal period) or anteflexion of the trunk ("yaw sign").

NB: There are "pathological" cases of GERD without pyrosis or regurgitation.


'''B. Atypical'' symptoms (''atypical'' GERD)

Dry cough, angina-like chest pain, dental erosions, certain types of laryngitis. The link remains debated for other symptoms: asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, recurrent otitis media. The difficulty lies in determining the causal link between the symptoms experienced and GERD.

In practice, other more frequent and/or urgent causes of chronic cough or chest pain should be ruled out before exploring the potential GERD responsible for these symptoms.

C. Signs suggestive of neoplastic pathology: dysphagia, weight loss, etc.
