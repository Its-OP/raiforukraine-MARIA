Psychotic disorganisation syndrome corresponds to a loss of psychic unity between emotions, cognition and behaviour.

== On a cognitive level

=== Alterations in the train of thought, with a diffuse, disjointed and sometimes incoherent discourse ===

* Barrages: sudden interruption of speech, in the middle of a sentence, followed by silence.
* Fading: slowing of speech and reduction in volume.
* Alterations in the logical system or illogicality.
* Ambivalence: tendency to experience or express two opposite feelings at the same time.
* Morbid rationalism: unrealistic logic and reasoning.
* Paralogical reasoning: intuitions, mixing of ideas, analogies.
* Impaired capacity for abstraction.

=== Language alterations ===

* Mannerism: precious, offbeat vocabulary.
* Neologism: new words.
* Paralogism: new meanings for known words or distortions of existing words.
* Neo-language: jargonophasia or schizophasia.

== Emotionally

* Ideo-affective disharmony = expression of ideas associated with opposing emotions.
* Discordant smiles, immotivated laughter.

== In terms of behaviour

* Gestural mannerism = poor coordination of movements.
* Parakinesia = unpredictable motor discharges, paramimia (mimics that distort facial expression).
