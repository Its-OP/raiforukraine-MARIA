== Risk factors ==
Factors which modify the level of risk, statistically associated with the occurrence of the disease.

* Biological/genetic: male sex, family history, etc.
* Pre- and perinatal factors: obstetric complications, starvation, folate deficiency, infection, stress, paternal age, born in winter or spring, etc.
* Lifestyle factors: cannabis
* Socio-economic factors: migration, job insecurity, stressful events, etc.
* Environmental factors: being born and growing up in an urban environment.

== Evolution
Generally chronic, fluctuating with acute episodes

Usually starts between the ages of 18 and 25

== ''Prognosis'' ==
5% of patients suffering from schizophrenia die by suicide.

Complete remission in 20 to 25% of cases

Preservation of a generally satisfactory quality of life, even if socio-professional functioning deteriorates most of the time

Good prognostic factors: female gender, favourable environment, good pre-morbid functioning, late onset (after age 35), good awareness of the disorder, early management and good adherence to antipsychotic treatment.
