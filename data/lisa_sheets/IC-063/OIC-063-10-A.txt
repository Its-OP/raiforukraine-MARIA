The positive psychotic syndrome corresponds to [[Delusional ideas SD-124|delusional ideas]] and [[Hallucinations SD-122|hallucinations]].

<br />

==Delusions
Lifetime prevalence of over 90%.

==Psychosensory hallucinations ==
Lifetime prevalence of 75%, most often in the acute phase.

Hallucinations arising from sensory manifestations. All the senses may be involved.

*Auditory hallucinations: most frequent, simple sounds (ringing, melody) or voices (acoustico-verbal hallucinations), often negative (criticism, comments on actions, injunctions), associated with attitudes of listening and the implementation of means of protection.
*Visual hallucinations: 30% of patients, elementary (lights, coloured spots, shadows, etc.) or complex (objects, people, scenes).
*Tactile hallucinations: 5% (burns, stings).
*Less frequent hallucinations of the other senses: Gustatory, olfactory or cenesthetic.

==Intrapsychic Hallucinations ==
Intrapsychic hallucinations do not involve the senses. They correspond to delusions whose theme is the loss of psychic intimacy: inner voices, thought echoes, thought reading, thought stealing, influence syndrome (impression of being remote-controlled by an external force).
