* Junctional tachycardias are clinically manifested by palpitations called "Bouvere's disease". They classically occur in young subjects (adolescents, young adults) and on healthy hearts.
* They are manifested by :
** palpitations (sometimes with cervical beats)
** sudden onset and abrupt cessation
** of variable duration
** a sensation of ''regular'' tachycardia
** with '''post-critical polyuria'''
** stopped by vagal manoeuvres or injection of adenosine'' or 5'-adenosine triphosphorus
* The ECG shows :
** per-critical: a ''regular tachycardia, most often with fine QRS'', with retrograde atrial activity (negative in the lower leads) sometimes invisible or hidden in the repolarisation
** outside palpitations: normal pattern or indicative of ventricular pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)
