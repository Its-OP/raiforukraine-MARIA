The elements of seriousness are the '''terrain''', the '''poor haemodynamic tolerance''' and the '''ventricular tachycardia''' which we look for by:

'''The Interrogation:'''

*Personal history:
**underlying cardiac disease (ischaemic, dilated, hypertrophic, congenital...),
**rhythm disorders, particularly ventricular,
**pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator
*family history
**sudden death in infancy or before the age of 35 in the family pointing to arrhythmias with a genetic cause (family tree).
*symptoms :
**lipothymia, syncope (''Malaise/loss of consciousness)''
**signs of low output (cerebral: confusion, digestive: abdominal pain)
**heart failure signs (''dyspnoea'')
**angina (linked to acute or functional coronary syndrome) (''chest pain'')

'''The electrocardiogram:'''

*Evoking an absolute emergency (risk of cardiorespiratory arrest):
**Any regular tachycardia with wide QRS is suggestive of ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise.
**repolarisation disorder suggestive of acute coronary syndrome
*ECG elements of severity:
**fine QRS tachycardia with poor clinical tolerance
**signs of underlying heart disease (sequelae, primary electrical disease)
