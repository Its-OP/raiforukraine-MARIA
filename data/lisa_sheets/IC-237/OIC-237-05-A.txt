* These are ''premature and ectopic beats'':
** in advance of ''normal'' beats and of different morphology because originating outside the normal conduction pathways.
** often followed by compensatory rest

*A distinction is made between extrasystoles :
**atrial'': originating in the ears and having a P'''' wave appearance that is different in morphology and premature compared to the sinus P wave, followed by a QRS identical to the baseline QRS.
**ventricular'': originating in the ventricles and having a premature ''wide QRS'' appearance different from the basal QRS without a prior P wave
**junctional'': rarer and originating in the hisian conduction pathways, they often take on the appearance of identical, premature QRS compared with the basal QRS without a prior P wave.

*'''Characteristics of extrasystoles:''''
**frequency (nb/24h)
**repeatability: isolated, doublets, bursts
**short/long/variable coupling (proximity of extrasystole to T wave)
**morphology: right/left delay, mono/polymorphic
**triggered by stress or at rest

*Often observed in the general population, they do not constitute a pathological element in themselves, but can be :
**symptomatic'' (sensation of jerkiness, missing beat or chest shock)
**initiate more serious arrhythmias (atrial extrasystoles and atrial fibrillation; ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation).
**Malignant ventricular extrasystoles are said to be''' :
***frequent
***polymorphic
***in bursts
***short coupling (R/T phenomenon)
***triggered by effort
***occurring in the setting of heart disease

*General causes include: alcoholism (''acute drunkenness''); electrocution; respiratory pathologies; hyperthyroidism (''goitre or thyroid nodule''); electrolyte abnormality (''monitoring of a patient in chronic renal failure, dyskalaemia''); ''anxietyÃÅ'', depression (''sad mood/moral pain''); pregnancy; sleep apnoea syndrome.
