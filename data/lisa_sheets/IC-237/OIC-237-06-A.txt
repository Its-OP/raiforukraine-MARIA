* Sinus tachycardia is defined as an acceleration of the normal sinus rhythm.

* It is most often ''reactionary or adaptive'':
** physiological context: effort, emotion, stress
** cardiac context: heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion (''dyspnoea, chest pain'')
** extracardiac context : fever, sepsis (''hyperthermia/fever''); anaemia ('''melena/rectorrhagia, drop in haemoglobin''), hypovolaemia ('''acute haemorrhage''); hypoxaemia ('''dyspnoea''); hyperthyroidism (''goitre or thyroid nodule''); pregnancy; alcoholism (''acute drunkenness''); withdrawal syndrome (''management of forced alcohol withdrawal''); drugs.

* Exceptionally, it occurs in isolation, and is known as ''inappropriate'' sinus tachycardia.
