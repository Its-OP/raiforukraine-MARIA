'''There are two types of ECG recording:'''

* The '''percritical''' ECG:'''
** i.e. concomitant with palpitations, allows an electroclinical correlation to be established. This is the only way of obtaining a definite diagnosis.
** Because palpitations are often transient in nature, it is rarely obtained on admission to the emergency department or on consultation.
** If it cannot be obtained during the initial treatment, a ''Holter ECG'' is performed, with a recording time of 24 to 96 hours in the case of frequent palpitations (>1/week) or a ''long-term ambulatory ECG'' (7 to 21 days) in the case of less frequent symptoms.
** If triggering circumstances are identified, a recording should be made under the usual conditions in which the palpitations occur, to make the examination more sensitive (e.g. stress test).
* The ''inter-critical'' ECG
** Carried out without palpitations, the ECG is often normal.
** However, it can also provide clues as to the mechanism of the palpitations (e.g. ST segment elevation, ventricular pre-excitation, etc.).
