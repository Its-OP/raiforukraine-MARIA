An individual is considered to be poor when his or her standard of living is below the poverty line.

According to Castel, social vulnerability is like an intermediate space between a zone of integration corresponding to professional stability and solid sociability, and a zone of disaffiliation corresponding to a situation of unemployment, social isolation and a feeling of insecurity<sup>.</sup> Vulnerability is therefore linked to both risk and the individual's ability to resist it.

Exclusion: the final stage of precariousness, as the consequence of a situation of precariousness that drags on and worsens, fed by environmental factors and by itself.

In sociology, marginalisation is when an individual or group of individuals deviates from the norm of society, excludes themselves from it or is excluded from it, sometimes abruptly breaking social ties.
