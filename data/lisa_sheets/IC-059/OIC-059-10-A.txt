The mission of the PASS (Permanence d'accès aux soins de santé - health care access centres) is to provide effective access and care for people in need, not only in hospitals, but also in institutional or association networks for care, reception and social support.

Lits halte soins santé (LHSS): medical-social facilities providing medical-social care for homeless people whose state of health, without requiring hospitalisation, is not compatible with life on the streets.
