According to the Haut Conseil de la santé publique <sup>:</sup> " ''precariousness does not characterise a particular social category, but is the result of a chain of events and experiences that lead to situations of economic, social and family fragility'".

According to the WHO, health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being.
