Hippocratic Oath: "My first concern shall be to restore, preserve or promote health in all its aspects, physical and mental, individual and social".

Code of ethics (article 50): the doctor must "facilitate the patient's obtaining the social benefits to which his condition entitles him. To this end, he is authorised, unless the patient objects, to communicate strictly essential medical information to the named medical officer of the social security body to which he belongs, or to another doctor working for a public body which decides on the granting of social benefits".

Article 54 (L. 1110-3 of the French Public Health Code): "all doctors, whatever their speciality, must provide care to all patients in precarious situations".
