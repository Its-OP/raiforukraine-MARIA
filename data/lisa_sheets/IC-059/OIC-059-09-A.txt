The breakdown of social ties is accompanied by serious somatic health problems and behavioural disorders.

CMU-C beneficiaries :

- declare themselves to be in poorer health than the rest of the population

- report more illnesses than the rest of the population of equivalent age and sex, up to twice as many for certain conditions such as depression and diabetes.

People living in precarious conditions have difficulty accessing healthcare, both because of 'refusal' practices on the part of certain healthcare professionals and because of financial difficulties.
