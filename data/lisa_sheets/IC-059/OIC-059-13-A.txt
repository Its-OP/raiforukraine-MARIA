PASS (Permanence d'accès aux soins de Santé - health care access offices)

Mission Accompagnement Santé: MAS (formerly PFIDASS)

- Ensuring that "support is extended to all difficulties in accessing care", and not just to situations where people are turning away from care.

- Clarity'': simple and understandable for as many people as possible, policyholders, partners and healthcare professionals alike, to ensure that the mission is shared more effectively.

- No stigma: accessible to all policyholders.

- '''Uniqueness''': a single name for uniform appropriation by the entire network.

Five major issues are now the entry point for policyholder support from the Mission Accompagnement Santé:

- Difficulties accessing rights,

- Giving up or having difficulty accessing care,

- Refusal or difficulty in accessing care due to a disability,

- Fragility in the face of digital technology,

- Complex social situation.
