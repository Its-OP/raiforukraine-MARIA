Social inequalities: consequences for health inequalities :

- Social differences in life expectancy

- Social differences in health expectancy

- Social differences in healthcare consumption

- Social differences in self-reported health

- Social differences in the adoption of health-promoting behaviours

- Life expectancy linked to socio-professional category (manager: highest life expectancy versus blue-collar worker: lowest)
