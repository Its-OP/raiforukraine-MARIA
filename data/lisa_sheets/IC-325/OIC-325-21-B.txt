==No-fault liability==
The French Public Health Code ([https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000020628252/ article L1142-1]) provides for ''two liability regimes'' in medical law:

*A fault-based liability regime,
*no-fault liability.

The aim of no-fault liability is to make good the loss suffered by compensating the victim (or his heirs) "without having to prove fault" on the part of the person who caused the loss.

==Role of ONIAM===
In the event of a medical accident, the victim (or his/her heirs) may refer the matter to the ''Commission de Conciliation et d'Indemnisation'' [CCI] in his/her region. In the case of ''no-fault'' liability, the victim will be compensated by the Office National d'Indemnisation des Accidents Médicaux, des Affections Iatrogènes et des Infections Nosocomiales (ONIAM) on the basis of ''national solidarity''.

The ONIAM's mission is therefore to organise a system of "out-of-court", rapid and free compensation for victims of medical accidents, whether at fault (in the event of insurance failure) or not, "without going to court".
