==Definition==
Inappropriate prescribing refers to prescribing that creates more risks than benefits for the patient.

Inappropriateness may relate to :

*Prescribing without a clinical indication, not complying with the marketing authorisation (MA) or the official recommendations of learned societies.
*Failure to take into account the patient's characteristics when choosing the active ingredient, dose, galenic form or route of administration of the drug: age, weight, co-morbidities (chronic renal failure, hepatocellular insufficiency, etc.), pregnancy, breast-feeding, for example.
*Failure to take account of potential drug interactions.
