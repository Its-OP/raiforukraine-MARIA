== Principle of imputability
Imputability is the estimation of the causal link between the drug and the observed effect.

Imputability is assessed by the regional pharmacovigilance centre during the pharmaco-medical evaluation of the report of an adverse drug reaction.

The French imputability method is based on chronological criteria (time of onset, evolution after discontinuation of the drug, re-administration), semiological criteria (existence of favourable factors, absence of differential diagnosis, pharmacological properties of the drug, etc.) and bibliographical criteria.
