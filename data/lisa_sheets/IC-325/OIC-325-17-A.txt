The [[Discovery of a therapeutic hazard or a medical error SD-331|errors]] may occur at various stages of the medication circuit and may result in the patient being administered :

*the wrong medicine,
*the wrong dose,
*by the wrong route,
*or the wrong treatment regimen.

==Prescription==
The risks identified as likely to lead to errors are :

*Oral prescription, for example by telephone (normally not authorised except in cases of force majeure), lack of communication between professionals, etc.
*Non-identification or incorrect identification of the patient or prescriber.
*Poorly legible prescriptions, use of abbreviations, incorrect computer prescriptions (''example'': when it is free text)
*Imprecise or incorrect wording: name, form, strength, dosage, duration, frequency or route of administration.
*Wrong choice of medicine
*Contraindications not respected, existence of interactions, associated conditions not taken into account (pregnancy, allergies, past history, etc.).
*Monitoring not specified.

==Preparation==
The risks identified as likely to lead to errors are :

*Lack of asepsis, risk of cross-contamination, failure to comply with preparation conditions (humidity, light, etc.).
*Errors on the manufacturing sheet, misinterpretation of the preparation procedure, etc.
*Errors in the raw material (lack of qualitative and quantitative identification), undetected physico-chemical incompatibility, errors in the nature or choice of excipients, etc.
*Weighing errors and lack of traceability, calculation errors, errors in the dosage of one or more products, dilution or volume errors, errors in the use or qualification of preparation or control equipment and facilities.
*Packaging errors, labelling errors.

==Transport==
The risks identified in connection with the transport of medicines are :

*Alteration of packaging, packaging unsuitable for hygiene, etc.
*Non-compliance with storage conditions: light, temperature (respect for the cold chain), pressure, humidity, etc.
*Security of medicines: unidentified and unsealed trolleys or containers.

==Detention and storage==
In healthcare establishments, medicines are kept in a place that is not accessible to the public. In community pharmacies, only a restricted list of medicines is available for direct access: "medicinal products for officinal use":

*Their packaging is designed to correspond to the dosage and expected duration of treatment.
*This does not apply to drugs with major contraindications, a risk of interactions, or which are intended for paediatric use.

A number of measures are proposed to prevent errors during storage or distribution in dispensing trolleys (in establishments):

*Equipment: secure cupboards, favour unit packaging, harmonise labelling.
*Environment: adequate lighting, guarantee good storage conditions.
*Staff: appoint a person to manage stock in the care unit, take into account the risk of confusion due to similar names and packaging.
*Prefer the full/empty system: the user picks supplies from the first bin. When the first bin is empty, the user signals that it is empty. This signal triggers a command to replenish the bin. At the same time, the user picks supplies from the second bin.

==Dispensation==
Risks may arise during :

*analysing prescriptions (difficult or too quick to read), communicating information
*galenic preparation
*Delivering medicines to care units or directly to patients (storage methods, distractions, work interruptions).

The main errors inherent in this stage are: dose errors, errors of omission, drug errors (similarity of name, presentation, etc.) and galenic form errors.

==Patient information==
Informing the patient, who is involved in the care process, is an essential step in avoiding administration errors.

A lack of communication between caregiver and patient can lead to a number of risks of confusion when patients self-administer their medication: dosage (units, drops, etc.), frequency, errors in administration technique, what to do in the event of adverse reactions, etc.

Information campaigns must be tailored to the specific situation of each patient (pathology, level of understanding, culture, lifestyle, etc.). They are carried out in a climate of trust and formulated in an understandable, clear and precise way. Those providing the information should ensure that it is understood by the patient (rephrasing, leaving time for questions) and those close to the patient, if present.

==Administration==
The risks identified in connection with the administration of medicines are :

*Errors in dosage, route of administration, form, timing, duration, error in administration technique
*Omission of administration
*Administration of out-of-date or degraded medication, unauthorised or unprescribed medication, product selection errors (anaesthetic trays, pre-prepared medication, medicine cabinet).
*Failure to record administration, failure to pass on medication NOT TAKEN by the patient to the prescriber and pharmacist.
*Errors in reading or interpreting labelling (frequent)
*Incorrect identification and programming of administration devices.
*Patient errors (e.g. double rooms in hospitals)
*Incorrect preparation of weekly diaries.

To make administration more secure: do away with transcriptions, keep the identifying packaging until the last moment, ask for the patient's identity, inform the patient, etc.

Finally, if you have any doubts about the drug, do not administer it.

==Patient monitoring==
To reduce the risk of medication errors, it is particularly important to :

*Know the elements of monitoring by treatment and approach.
*Monitor clinical and biological parameters, and carry out pharmacological therapeutic monitoring where necessary.
*Monitor the occurrence of adverse effects.
