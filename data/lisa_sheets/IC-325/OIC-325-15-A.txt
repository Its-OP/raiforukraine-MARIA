=Identify a medication error, its mechanisms and know the consequences=

==Definition==
According to the French National Authority for Health, a medicinal product error is defined as any preventable event which could cause or lead to the inappropriate use of a medicinal product or to harm to the patient when the medicinal product is under the control of the healthcare professional, patient or user.

This is an unintentional act involving the medicinal product during the care process.

A medicinal product error is said to have occurred when the error has been confirmed, and a "near miss" or potential error when the error has been identified and avoided in time.
<br />

==Mechanisms==
A medication error may be linked to professional practice, healthcare products, procedures and systems covering the entire medication circuit: prescribing, communication of the prescription, dispensing, preparation, distribution, administration, education, therapeutic monitoring/follow-up and use. Causes directly related to the product may also be found, and linked to the labelling, packaging or nomenclature of the product.
<br />

==Characterisation of an error==

*its classification: "error, potential error or risk of error".
*its stage: prescribing, dispensing, preparation, administration, therapeutic follow-up, etc.
*the nature of the error: drug, dose, dosage/concentration, route of administration, flow rate, administration technique, patient, time of administration, duration of administration, omission, etc.
*their causes: communication problems, human factors, name confusion, labelling and/or information problems, packaging or design problems, etc.

<br />

==Consequences==
A medication error can result in :

*An adverse event resulting in harm to the patient
*A near miss in which the patient almost suffered harm
*No harm or risk of harm
