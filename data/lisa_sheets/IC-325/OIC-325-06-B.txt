== Epidemiology of iatrogenic risks


An adverse event related to healthcare is an unfavourable event for the patient as a result of diagnostic, treatment, prevention or rehabilitation strategies and procedures.

Risks related to healthcare are regularly assessed, in particular through the national study of adverse events related to healthcare in healthcare establishments (ENEIS). The main results of this ENEIS study (<nowiki>https://drees.solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/2020-10/er398-3.pdf</nowiki>) are as follows:

* 3 to 5% of medical and surgical admissions were due to a serious adverse event.
* Approximately 50% of serious adverse events leading to hospitalisation were associated with healthcare products, half of which were avoidable.
* The observed incidence of serious adverse events during hospitalisation in medicine or surgery is around 7%.
* 2 out of 5 serious adverse events occurring during hospitalisation are considered to be avoidable.
* In 2 out of 5 cases, serious adverse events occurring during hospitalisation lead to prolonged hospitalisation.
