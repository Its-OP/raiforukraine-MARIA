Counterfeiting a medicine is the deliberate and fraudulent misrepresentation of a medicine:

    - its identity: name, composition, activity or other details.

    - and/or its source: manufacturer, country of manufacture, country of origin, marketing authorisation holders, distribution stages.

It can be applied to :

    - specialities or generic products

    - products containing the correct ingredients/components, no active ingredient or an insufficient amount of active ingredient, or products whose packaging has been tampered with.

Dating from 1992, this World Health Organisation (WHO) definition serves as a reference. The same definition was extended to counterfeit HEALTH PRODUCTS by the International Medicines Products AntiCounterfeitingTask force (IMPACT) in 2008.

Not to be confused with :

    - patent infringement or patent litigation

    - Unregistered products: medical products (generics or specialities) that are not authorised for sale in a given country but are authorised for sale elsewhere.

    - Unintentionally inferior products: batches that do not meet standards, quality defects or failure to comply with good manufacturing or distribution practices.

Fake medicines" have a broader definition to extend the scope of the WHO's fight against counterfeit medicines:

- counterfeit medicines: the concept of intellectual property protection varies greatly from country to country

- patent infringement: requires chemical analysis of the product

- trademark infringement: e.g. imitation packaging

The term "counterfeiting", which is ambiguous, is therefore being abandoned.

Several texts have been adopted to strengthen this fight, including the Council of Europe Convention on counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes threatening public health (known as Medicrime).
