=Define and explain the general mechanisms of the main drug-induced pathologies=
Drug-induced pathologies are numerous and polymorphous. When faced with any clinical picture, it is advisable to think about the drug.
<br />

==''General mechanisms of drug-induced pathologies'''==

*Type A, predictable effects: these undesirable effects are directly due to the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the drug and are often dose-dependent.

Examples: extra-pyramidal syndrome in a patient treated with neuroleptics, directly linked to the dopaminergic blockade exerted by the neuroleptics, acute renal failure in a dehydrated patient treated with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system directly due to the action of these drugs on intra-renal haemodynamics, etc.

*Type B, unpredictable effects: these effects cannot be explained by the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug.

Example: immuno-allergic reaction following the administration of a medicinal product

==Physiopathology of the main drug-induced pathologies ==

===''Extrapyramidal syndrome''===
Dopaminergic blockade (neuroleptics, and "hidden" neuroleptics such as metoclopramide (anti-emetic))

===''Atropinic or muscarinic syndrome'' ===
Resulting from the anti-cholinergic properties of certain drugs.

Mechanism:

*muscarinic receptor antagonism at peripheral level: counteracts the bradycardia-inducing effects of acetylcholine, antispasmodic action on smooth muscle fibres in the digestive tract and urinary tract, reduced secretions (gastric, salivary, lacrimal).  
*In high doses, a central excitatory action may be observed (excitation, confusion, hallucination, hyperthermia, coma).

Existence of an "anticholinergic" drug impregnation scale:

*Level 1, demonstrated anticholinergic potential, e.g. valproic acid, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, etc.
*Level 2, anticholinergic effects usually observed at high doses, e.g. carbamazepine, loxapine, etc.
*Level 3, high anticholinergic potential: amitriptyline, clozapine, imipramine, nortriptyline, clomipramine, etc.

===Neuroleptic malignant syndrome ===
Idiosyncratic, rare and severe reaction combining hyperthermia, severe muscular rigidity, disturbed consciousness and signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction (sweating, tachycardia, hypertension or labile blood pressure). Diagnostic criteria have been established by the DSM IV. All neuroleptics may be implicated.

===''Serotonin syndrome'''===

*Mechanism: most often the result of a drug interaction inducing an increase in the bioavailability of serotonin at the synapse. This results in post-synaptic hyperactivation of 5-HT1A receptors.
*Clinical manifestations in the context of taking a serotonergic agent: altered mental state (agitation, confusion), myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, tremor, diarrhoea, coordination problems, fever, etc.
*Drugs involved: antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, serotonin reuptake inhibitors), tramadol, antiparkinsonian drugs (selegiline), etc.

===''Bradycardia, conduction disorder''===

*Mechanism: negative chronotropic effect
*Drugs involved: beta-blockers, anti-arrhythmics, digoxin, anticholinesterase agents, non-dihydropyridine anticalciques (diltiazem, verapamil), etc.

=== ''QT prolongation, torsade de pointe'' ===

*Mechanisms: drugs that act on potassium channels or drugs that induce hypokalaemia.
*Drugs involved: a large number. Cardiotropic drugs (anti-arrhythmics, digitalis), psychotropic drugs (neuroleptics, imipraminic antidepressants, etc.), anti-infectives (quinine, macrolides, etc.), anti-histamines, etc. Hypokalaemic drugs (diuretics, etc.).

===Heart failure ====
Mechanisms: direct negative inotropic effect (beta-blockers, non-dihydropyridine anticalciques, antiarrhythmics, etc.), or impairment of myocardial function (anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, etc.).

===''Blood pressure variation'''===

*Arterial hypertension: due to a water retention effect (e.g. corticoids) or an increase in peripheral resistance (alpha adrenergic sympathomimetics, including nasal vasoconstrictors).
*Arterial hypotension, orthostatic hypotension:'' by a dopaminergic effect (levodopa, ICOMT, IMAOB), by an alpha-blocker effect (imipraminic antidepressant), by a vasodilator effect (nitrate derivatives, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (sildenafil, etc.), by an effect of reducing extracellular volume (diuretics).

===''Hepatitis'''===

*Toxic mechanisms:

For example, paracetamol: the detoxification capacity of the toxic metabolite by glutathione is exceeded (either in an overdose situation or in a glutathione-depleted situation (malnutrition, chronic alcoholism, etc.).

*Immunoallergic mechanism

===''Musculoskeletal effects'''===

*Osteoporosis: corticoids, heparins, aromatase inhibitors, etc.
*Pain and rhabdomyolysis: statins, for example.
*Tendinopathies: fluroquinolones

===''Haematological effects'''===
Agranulocytosis, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, haemorrhage

Mechanisms :

*either toxic, dose-dependent, often progressive in onset
*Or immunological: formation of an antibody-antigen complex on the surface of the cell responsible for its destruction, dose-independent effect, sudden onset (e.g. heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).
*Haemorrhage and anticoagulants

===''Cutaneous effects''===
see "[[Toxidermia]]" ITEM 115

===''Respiratory effects'''===

*Bronchospasm: due to an effect on beta-adrenergic receptors in the smooth muscle cells of the bronchial tree (beta-adrenergic blockers).
*Respiratory depression: due to the central effect of morphine, for example.

=== ''Effects on the immune system'' ===
Immune system suppression (immunosuppressants, e.g. cyclosporine, corticosteroids, etc.)

Autoimmune diseases (therapeutic antibodies that inhibit PD1/PDL1 checkpoints: nivolumab, ipilimumab, for example)

===''Carcinogenic effect'''===
e.g. acute leukaemia secondary to previous cancer chemotherapy

===''Effects on the nervous system'''===

*Toxic peripheral neuropathies (e.g. vincristine, fludarabine, platinum salts, etc.)
*Central effects: sedative (e.g. benzodiazepines, first-generation antihistamines), excitatory (corticoids), etc.

===''Endocrine effects'''===

*Diabetes induced by corticosteroid therapy, for example
*Hypothyroidism (e.g. anti-VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors)
