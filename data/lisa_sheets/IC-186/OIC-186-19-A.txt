The multi-allergen test is prescribed by the ''primary care physician''.

It is prescribed for children when questioning points to a respiratory or food allergy, and when an allergist cannot be consulted for several months.

We look for IgE sensitisation.

- In respiratory allergy, tests identical to those used in adults (see above)

- For food allergies, prescriptions depend on the child's age:


o ''Before the age of 1'', a ''fx5'' test is prescribed (milk, egg, fish, peanut, soya, wheat) which can detect > 90% of food allergies

o ''After 1 year'', a ''TrophatopÂ® child'' is prescribed, which includes the allergens tested in the fx5 and extends it to other allergens (mustard, hazelnut, shrimp, kiwi, beef, sesame). The test can detect over 90% of allergies before the age of 6 and over 80% after the age of 6. A negative result rules out an allergy to the panel of allergens tested.


Warning: ''a positive multi-allergen test does not mean allergy''. In fact, if exposure to the allergen detected as positive is well tolerated, there is no allergy (e.g. positive specific IgE to peanuts, even though the patient eats peanuts without any problem, means sensitisation and not allergy). This is important because it is not necessary to avoid the food in this case, or even "it may lead to a long-term allergy to the food" (break in tolerance).
