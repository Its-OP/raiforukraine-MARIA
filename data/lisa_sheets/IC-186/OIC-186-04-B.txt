Prevalence of drug hypersensitivity: approximately 7% of the general population, ''mainly non-allergic'' (>90% of cases) in both children and adults.

- The most common clinical form is non-allergic urticaria caused by drugs (see Lisa 187 "urticaria").

- Allergic hypersensitivity to drugs is therefore rare, but can sometimes lead to severe anaphylaxis.

- The most frequent allergens are ''antibiotics'', in particular ''beta lactam antibiotics'' and, in the operating theatre, ''curares''.

- In France, ''most deaths'' due to anaphylaxis in adults are of ''drug-induced'' aetiology.<br /> In France, ''most deaths'' due to anaphylaxis in adults are of ''drug-induced'' aetiology.
