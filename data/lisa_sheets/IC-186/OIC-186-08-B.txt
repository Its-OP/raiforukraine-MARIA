Peanut is the food most frequently implicated in severe anaphylactic food allergy and responsible for death.

- Prevalence in the general population: 1% ;

- '''Allergy generally persistent''' throughout the patient's life.

- Rarely associated with an allergy to other legumes;

- Frequently associated with an allergy to nuts (walnuts, pistachios, cashews, hazelnuts).

The diagnosis of allergy to peanuts or nuts is based on :

- history (clinical history compatible with an immediate reaction)

- food category survey (consumption of peanuts and/or nuts)

- skin tests (pricks) with standardised extracts or, more often, with the native food. A negative test generally rules out an allergy

- Multi-allergen test (in primary care if no short-term allergic opinion is available), then specific IgE (peanut and nuts).

- a provocation test to provide proof, if necessary, that the suspected food is responsible (gold standard).


Treatment is based on the treatment of anaphylaxis during the 1st<sup>er</sup> allergic accident (see Lisa 388 fact sheet), and "secondary prevention" via the avoidance of the allergen and therapeutic education, (in particular by training the patient / those around him in the treatment of anaphylaxis).
