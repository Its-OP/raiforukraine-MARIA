Respiratory allergies manifest themselves as asthma and/or rhinitis (see Lisa sheet item 188). The ''diagnosis of respiratory allergy'' is based on the demonstration of a strong association between exposure to an allergen and the onset of symptoms.

This association is evaluated :

1- by the "unity of place, time and action".

o "Per-annual pneumallergens" (responsible for per-annual symptoms) are most often "indoor allergens":

ยง dust mites and cockroaches, animal dander: dogs, cats, rodents; mould.

ยง Certain outdoor moulds such as Alternaria are also involved in allergic phenomena.

o "Seasonal pneumallergens" are most often "outdoor allergens":

ยง pollens from trees, grasses (the most ubiquitous), herbaceous plants,...


2- and by "evidence of sensitisation" to the allergen (positive skin test/presence of specific IgE antibodies).
