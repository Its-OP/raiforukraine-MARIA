The environmental factors mentioned are :

- Changes in eating habits: "late diversification", contact with "new food allergens" (sesame, etc.), etc.

- Passive smoking (pre- and post-natal);

- The "indoor allergen" environment, modified by energy-saving measures over the last 50 years (confined indoor air): dust mites, animal allergens, mould, cockroaches, food proteins in house dust, etc.)

- Atmospheric pollution (adjuvant role / non-specific inflammation, like an adjuvant in a vaccine)

- The ''decline in microbial biodiversity'': the hygienist theory is based on the observation of an epidemiological relationship between the decline in infectious contacts and the increase in allergic and auto-immune diseases; the current theory is that the decline in biodiversity (role of the microbiota) is to blame.

- As a result, the incidence of atopy is lower:

o in the youngest siblings (more often infected by older siblings);

o in children who have been to cr√®ches (infectious contagion) ;

o in children conceived, born and raised in rural areas and environments rich in bacterial endotoxins.


Occupational factors : The diagnosis of occupational allergy is based on evidence of a "link between the onset of allergic symptoms and occupational exposure" (improvement in symptoms at weekends or during holidays, at least at the beginning of the course).


In particular, asthmatics should be systematically screened for occupational allergies. The professions most concerned are :

- Baker (allergen = wheat, flour mite)

- Healthcare professionals (latex, aldehydes, ammoniums)

- Hairdressers (persulfates)

- Painters (isocyanates)

- Cleaning agents (ammoniums, etc.)

- Woodworkers
