Therapeutic education is a ''fundamental aspect of the management of food allergy''. It aims to empower allergic patients (and/or their families in the case of children) and is part of the secondary prevention of allergy.


- In the ''avoidance diet'' of allergens (learning to read labels for processed foods, identifying high-risk foods)

- In the '''' use of the emergency kit''': assessment of symptoms leading to its use, definition of what to do, learning how to handle products, in particular self-injectable adrenaline (pen)

- The emergency kit contains :

o H1 antihistamines and oral corticosteroids, bronchodilators if there is a history of bronchospasm, auto-injectable adrenaline if there is a history of or risk of anaphylaxis.


The ''projet d'accueil individualis√©'' (PAI), in the case of a child, is drawn up at the request of the parents. The PAI is a ''waiver of doctor-patient confidentiality'' and makes it possible to draw up: 1) a list of dietary restrictions to be observed, 2) a treatment protocol in the event of an accidental allergic reaction at school or during the children's extra-curricular activities.
