Respiratory allergy in children results from the pressure of an environment against a predisposed genetic background (polygenic disease). In France today, ''10% of children are asthmatic''. This risk increases when one of the two parents is asthmatic (25% of asthmatic children in this case), and to more than 50% if both parents are asthmatic.


The ''main triggers'' in childhood asthma are primarily

- viral infections

- allergy to pneumallergens (the same as in adults)


There are other ''clearly identified factors'' that trigger asthma in children:

- exposure to tobacco from conception

- indoor air pollution and atmospheric pollution


Alterations to the microbiota of newborn babies could increase the risk of developing allergic pathologies.
