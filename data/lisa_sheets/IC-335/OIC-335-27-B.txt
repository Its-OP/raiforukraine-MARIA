'''Acute complications of Le Fort fractures'''

* very frequent epistaxis, spontaneously resolving in most cases, sometimes massive, requiring anterior and posterior tamponade with a double balloon tube (Bivona type); such tamponade must be carried out under cover of anthiobioprohpylaxis, and after ruling out an associated fracture of the anterior stage of the base of the skull.
* Nerve involvement: hypoesthesia or even anaesthesia in the infraorbital nerve territory (branches of the V2).
* orbital involvement: oculomotor abnormalities, even direct ocular involvement (BAV which may lead to blindness),
* associated cranial involvement: possible irradiation of fractures at the anterior level of the base of the skull (meningitis, anosmia).

Secondary complications of Le Fort fractures

* Sequelae of occlusal and morphological abnormalities: due to the absence or failure of reduction.
* Sensory sequelae: hypoesthesia or even sequelae of painful dysesthesia in the V2 nerve territory (despite reduction).
* Sensory sequelae: visual abnormalities, anosmia.
* in cases of neuromeningeal breach (Le Fort II and III): CSF rhinorrhea, meningitis.
* cranial trauma syndrome associating headaches, memory disorders, mood disorders and sleep disorders.
