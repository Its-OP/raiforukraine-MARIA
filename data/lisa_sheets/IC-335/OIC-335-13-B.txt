Fractures of the zygoma are laterofacial fractures always associating 3 fracture sites:

- fracture of the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus radiating upwards towards the floor of the orbit and downwards towards the zygomatomaxillary arch;

- fracture of the temporal process of the zygoma

- fracture of the frontal apophysis of the zygoma (generally opposite the fronto-zygomatic suture)
