This is a surgical emergency; if the incarceration is not reduced rapidly, the inferior rectus muscle becomes ischaemic and may become necrotic, fibrosed and therefore a source of sequellar diplopia which cannot be resolved.

the floor is approached via a transconjunctival or transcutaneous route, depending on the surgeon's choice. In an emergency, severe oedema may make the transconjunctival approach difficult.

a subperiosteal detachment of the orbital floor is performed, allowing it to collapse into the maxillary sinus (in a way, a "trap door" fracture is transformed into a "blow out" fracture), and freeing the inferior rectus muscle, often accompanied by intraorbital fat. the bone fragments threatening the muscle are removed.

The floor is reconstructed, usually using an allogeneic material (absorbable or non-absorbable polymer, titanium, etc.).

Antibiotic prophylaxis is associated with nose-blowing, which is contraindicated.
