Early complications

* Hypoesthesia of the V2 nerve due to damage to the nerve in its intraorbital course and/or at the level of its emergence (infraorbital foramen).
* Infectious complications, in the maxillary sinus, or more rarely (but dreadfully) intraorbital.
* Limitation of mouth opening (trismus)
* Diplopia, enophthalmos and ocular dystopia, due to damage to the walls of the orbit (particularly the floor); in the absence of anatomical reduction of these walls, enophthalmos and diplopia are permanent. Rarely, diplopia is of neurological origin (contusion or damage to the oculomotor nerves in the superior orbital fissure) but is then often accompanied by suggestive associated signs (mydriasis, ptosis).
* A drop in visual acuity is possible in association with contusion of the globe at the time of the trauma. Cases of blindness have been reported.

Secondary complications, generally reflecting the absence or inadequacy of initial treatment

* Morphological sequelae: sunken cheekbone, enophthalmos, ocular dystopia.
* Maxillary sinusitis
* Residual diplopia
* Hypoesthesia and neuralgia of the infraorbital nerve.
