Ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint after fracture of the condyle is possible, and is clinically manifested by a progressive and chronic limitation of mouth opening; it is more frequent in cases of intra-articular fracture.

radiological evidence of ossification of the joint region

Treatment is essentially preventive, with early mobilisation of these fractures; if ankylosis is present, surgery involves resection of the ankylosis block and interposition of a material/prosthesis to prevent recurrence.
