'''Extreme emergency situations'''

* Bleeding from an orifice (stomatorrhagia, epistaxis, otorrhagia) or a wound
* Asphyxia
* Traumatic blindness

'''Serious fractures;''' These are :

* either a panfacial fracture, associating a fracture of the mid-face with a fracture of the mandible;
* or a fracture radiating towards the craniofacial confines with a neuromeningeal complication.

These situations sometimes require multidisciplinary management involving neurosurgeons in the case of meningeal breaches, fractures of the cranial vault or frontal sinus.

'''Severity criteria for soft tissue injuries of the face'''

*Transfixing wounds
*Periorificial wounds
*Lesions affecting the eyelids, eye and lacrimal ducts,
*Injury to the facial nerve,
*Injury to a salivary gland and its salivary duct.
*Bite wounds
*Burns to the face
*Presence of foreign bodies
