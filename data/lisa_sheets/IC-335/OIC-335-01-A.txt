'''1. vital emergencies'''

Vital emergencies must be diagnosed quickly and treated as soon as the casualty is collected from the scene of the accident:

ASPHYXIA This may be caused by upper airway obstruction (bone fragments, dentures, teeth, blood clots), possibly glossoptosis (complicating a fracture of the mandible), or a facial burn. Freedom of the upper airway must be systematically checked: if it cannot be maintained, naso- or orotracheal intubation, or even a tracheotomy, should be considered.

HYPOVOLEMIC SHOCK with major haemorrhages, as the face is richly vascularised. Haemodynamic functions must be monitored systematically. Resuscitation measures are not specific.

association with another trauma: any facial trauma must, until proven otherwise, be considered as a cranial trauma and a cervical spine trauma. in polytrauma patients, the associated thoracoabdominal or orthopaedic trauma often takes precedence.

'''2. Functional emergencies

Functional emergencies should also be investigated, as they will require rapid treatment in a specialist department:

VISUAL INJURY: damage to the optic nerve, diplopia, disfiguring eyelid wounds. If the eyeball is exposed, it must be protected with a regularly moistened dressing until definitive treatment.

FACIAL PARALYSIA due to facial nerve injury: a facial motor examination must be carried out on a patient who is vigorous, as the injury may be masked by subsequent sedation or worsening of consciousness;
