the action to be taken depends on whether the biting animal is known or not

The greatest risk is infection, particularly by rabies (rare but fatal).

'''Case 1: known animal'''

check for unusual behaviour (agitation, recent aggressiveness) that could indicate contamination

rabies, and seek veterinary advice.

'''Case 2: unknown animal'''

Always ask the nearest rabies centre what to do (risk varies from region to region)


if the animal is known to be alive, systematic veterinary surveillance is undertaken, with an examination on D3, D7 and D15. If, after this period, the animal is still asymptomatic, there is no need to vaccinate the bitten patient against rabies. If the dog shows suspicious signs, the patient should be vaccinated.

If the animal is dead or killed, its head must be sent to the Institut Pasteur in Paris for a histological diagnosis of its brain matter. The vaccination protocol is started while awaiting the results, and stopped if there is no rabies contamination.
