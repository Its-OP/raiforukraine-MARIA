* Pain at the fracture line, with functional impotence
* Modification of the dental articulation by displacement of the bone fragments (resulting in a disorder of dental occlusion (gap, premature contact, etc.))
* Trismus, i.e. limitation of mouth opening caused by reflex contracture of the masticatory muscles.
* Hypoesthesia, even anaesthesia in the territory of the inferior alveolar-dental nerve (branch of the V3), in the case of damage to the mandibular canal.
* Gingival bleeding (stomatorrhoea) and hypersalivation, sometimes with drooling (sialorrhoea).
