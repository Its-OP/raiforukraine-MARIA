<u>A disorder of dental occlusion</u> is present whatever the stage of the fracture; functional impotence and epistaxis are frequent

'''Fracture de Le Fort I''''

* Horseshoe-shaped ecchymosis at the back of the upper vestibule.
* Painful palpation of the floor of the upper vestibule.
* Isolated, painful mobility of the palatal plateau and the upper dental arch in relation to the rest of the facial mass.

'''Fracture de Le Fort II et III'''

* Loss of nasal root, collapse of the nasal pyramid and
* Periorbital ecchymosis "like glasses",
* The face is depressed with global oedema and multiple ecchymoses: typical "lunar" facies.
* Periorbital subcutaneous emphysema (pneumorbitis), increased in the event of a Valsalva manoeuvre (spontaneous blowing of the nose by the patient, contraindicated).
* Painful palpation of fracture sites
* Mobility of the palate, maxillary dental arch and nasal pyramid in relation to the rest of the facial mass.
* The zygomas are stable in Le Fort II and mobile in Le Fort III.
* Hypoesthesia in the infraorbital nerve territory (V2).
* Tearing as a result of damage to the walls of the lacrimal sac. Other visual symptoms (visual disturbance, diplopia) may occur as a result of orbital damage. (Cf item fracture of the orbital floor)
* Cerebrospinal rhinorrhoea in case of irradiation of the horizontal fracture of the root of the nose at the anterior level of the base of the skull (generally masked by epistaxis).
* Anosmia in cases of irradiation of the fracture to the sieve plate of the ethmoid.
