a meningeal breach at the anterior level of the skull is possible in the case of fractures of the CNEMFO (Cadre Naso Ethmoido Maxillo Fronto Orbitaire, or "obsolete nose"), or Le Fort fractures II and III.

These fractures are caused by high-kinetic trauma, in which the patients are to be considered as head trauma victims.

CSF rhinorrhea may occur, but is frequently masked by the associated epistaxis.

The risk is that of meningitis, which must be detected and prevented by appropriate vaccinations. As far as possible, analgesic treatment should not include paracetamol, so as not to mask hyperthermia.
