The repair of facial skin wounds requires exploration to look for signs of severity, foreign bodies or vascular and nerve damage;

after exploration and antisepsis, under local or even general anaesthetic, careful suturing is carried out plane by plane; extensive trimming or flaps are not indicated in the acute phase.

signs of seriousness :

Nerve damage'', particularly to the facial nerve (7th cranial pair), requiring the face's motor skills to be tested; it is suspected in deep damage to the parotid region, or on the theoretical course of a branch of the facial nerve.

Vascular involvement: arterial branches of the external carotid artery, particularly the temporal and facial pedicles, which are relatively exposed.

Periorificial damage, which causes scar retraction, requires careful suturing and follow-up. In particular, palpebral wounds and internal ''canthi'' wounds close to the lacrimal ducts must be explored, and completed by an ophthalmological examination, in search of an associated globe wound and/or keratitis.

'''Salivary involvement''': Wounds in the parotid region may damage the salivary parenchyma, and be complicated by a collection and/or a salivary fistula; a section of the parotid duct must be detected, and sutured to a catheter to prevent stenosis of the duct and a salivary fistula.

'''Loss of substance''''s: in the case of serious wounds, possibly from biting, or ballistic trauma, a loss of substance may be observed; in the acute phase, the aim is to avoid infection and prevent retraction; secondary reconstruction is always to be planned.
