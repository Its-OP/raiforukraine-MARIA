'''<u><big>dental contusion</big></u>'''

it manifests itself after direct trauma to the tooth as spontaneous dental pain, which may persist for a few hours to a few days, with no radiological abnormalities; follow-up is essential, as mortification of the tooth may occur, leading to infection and dental dyschromia. the treatment is odontological.

<u>'''<big>Dental fractures</big>'''</u>

'''1. crown fracture, with or without pulpal exposure'''

The tooth is painful, especially when the pulp is exposed (increased by heat and cold). A retro-alveolar image shows the fracture line and its position in relation to the pulp. If the pulp is exposed, endodontic treatment is required.

'''2. Root fracture

the patient reports pain and/or tooth mobility; the examination is poor. the diagnosis is based on the retroalveolar X-ray the more or less apical location of the fracture has an important prognostic value: the more distal the fracture, the more compromised the tooth.

in the two previous cases, and pending a dental consultation, treatment is essentially symptomatic.

'''3. Alveolodental dislocation'': a retroalveolar X-ray is taken as soon as possible;

When the dislocation is incomplete (or subluxation), the treatment consists of reducing the dislocation and putting in place a restraint.

In the event of complete dislocation, if the state of the periodontium permits and if the tooth has been recovered, reimplantation and retention should be attempted rapidly, at best within one hour of the trauma, especially if the patient is young.
