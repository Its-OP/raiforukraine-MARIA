in cases of suspected fracture of the floor of the orbit,

# A complete ophthalmological examination, including visual acuity and oculomotricity, is systematically recommended.
# a CT scan of the facial mass, without injection of contrast product, with reconstruction in the 3 planes of space (particularly coronal) and possibly in the orbital axis, to document the fracture and any complications (damage to the orbital foramen, intra-orbital haematoma, muscle incarceration, etc.).

These two examinations are necessary and sufficient. Orbital MRI is not a first-line examination; they should not delay surgical management if muscle incarceration is clinically suspected.
