The INTERROGATOR will ask the patient's family and friends (if the patient is unable to do this themselves) to specify :

#trauma modalities'': the circumstances in which the trauma occurred and, above all, its intensity

2. the "existence of functional signs": perception of a cracking sound, initial loss of consciousness, spontaneous or provoked pain, functional discomfort (manducatory, visual, respiratory and phonatory), etc.

3. history and treatment

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, symmetrical and comparative

1. l''''Inspection of the face''' search :

a skin lesion at the point of impact (wound, bruise, haematoma),

haemorrhage from a natural orifice or wound

localised or generalised oedema

a deformity that most often indicates a displaced fracture, often masked by the rapid onset of post-traumatic oedema.

2 ''Facial motor examination'' (facial nerve, VIIth pair of cranial nerves).

3. Examination of facial sensitivity (trigeminal nerve, fifth pair of cranial nerves).

4. Endocavitary examinations :

- Nasal cavities: by anterior rhinoscopy using a nasal speculum after evacuation of clots by washing and blowing the nose

- Oral cavity: examination of the dental articulation, search for dental and mucous membrane lesions. removal of foreign bodies: tooth, clot, dental prosthesis, etc.

- External auditory canals, to check for clots or wounds.

5. the ''<nowiki/>'Manducation examination'' assesses temporomandibular joint movements (mouth opening, propulsion and right and left diductions of the mandible), dental occlusion, presence of trismus.

6. l''''Examen ophtalmologique''' reports :

visual acuity, limited eye movement (leading to diplopia), pupil condition, palpebral function, etc.

Look for ocular dystopia: enophthalmos, hypoglobe, elevation of the globe, exophthalmos, etc.

If in doubt, seek specialist ophthalmological advice.

7. '''Neurological examination'''

It looks for an immediate or delayed disturbance of consciousness (Glasgow score, to be reassessed during monitoring), an abnormality of the pupils and direct and consensual pupillary reflexes, anterograde or retrograde amnesia, anosmia, cerebrospinal rhinorrhoea (often masked).
