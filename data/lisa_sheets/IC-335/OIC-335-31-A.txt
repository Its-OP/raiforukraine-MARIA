Head trauma is a frequent reason for consultations, but fortunately the vast majority (95%) are mild head injuries, defined by a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) greater than or equal to 13. Of these, less than 10% of children actually present with an intracranial lesion, and less than 1% will require neurosurgical intervention.

The aim of the treatment is to ''determine which children will need to be scanned and monitored in hospital'', and which will be able to return home with monitoring instructions.

Risk factors for intracranial lesions should be investigated in every child who has suffered a cranial trauma, so that treatment can be adapted accordingly:

*Suspicion of abuse
*Age â‰¤ 3 months
*Loss of consciousness
*Dangerous mechanism:
**Road accident in a car if the passenger is ejected from the vehicle or if another passenger has died or in the event of a rollover or if the victim is an unhelmeted pedestrian or cyclist;
**a fall of more than 0.9 m before the age of two (the height of a table) or more than 1.5 m after the age of two;
**CT by a high-kinetic object...to be specified on a case-by-case basis (hammer blow, etc.).

*Paediatric Glasgow score below 15 (calculation depends on patient's age).
*Agitation, drowsiness, slowness of speech or repetitive questions.
*Disconsolate crying or abnormal behaviour according to the parents.
*Clinical signs of skull base embarrassement or lesion (retroauricular ecchymosis, periorbital ecchymosis, otorrhagia or haemotympanum, CSF rhinorrhoea/otorrhoea).
*Vomiting or severe headache if the child is over 2 years old.
*Subcutaneous haematoma / loccipital, temporal or parietal haematoma if the child is less than 2 years old.

The criteria for hospitalisation following head trauma, whether or not imaging was required, are relatively similar:

*loss of consciousness
*severe trauma mechanism
*GCS not back to 15 or abnormal behaviour according to the parents
*vomiting or severe headache (if persistent for more than 12 hours after the trauma, brain imaging may be indicated)
*non-frontal haematoma if the child is less than 2 years old clinical signs of skull base embarrassement or lesion
*presence of significant recent CT abnormalities or
*inability to perform a cerebral CT scan despite its indication
*the presence of other risk factors: intoxication, drugs, alcohol, suspected abuse.

The decision to carry out brain imaging is based on the PECARN (Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network) decision tree according to the child's age, in order to determine the risk of developing clinically severe intracranial lesions.
