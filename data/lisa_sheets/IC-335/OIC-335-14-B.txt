On inspection

* The relief of the homolateral cheekbone is erased: the face is asymmetric. This displacement of the zygoma is often masked by oedema and should be checked after a few days.
* Painful limitation of mouth opening (trismus), related to compression or skewering of the temporal muscle opposite the fracture.
* Homolateral epistaxis, indicating the presence of blood in the maxillary sinus, and external subconjunctival haemorrhage.
* The clinical signs of a fracture of the floor of the orbit may be associated: diplopia, possible limitation of movement of the eyeball (particularly in elevation) in the case of incarceration of the inferior rectus muscle, enophthalmos and/or ocular dystopia.

On palpation

* Displacement opposite the fracture sites ("stair-step" appearance).
* More or less mobile pain in the body of the zygoma.
* Hypoesthesia in the infraorbital nerve territory (terminal branch of the maxillary nerve, V2).
* Periorbital oedema and ecchymosis, even subcutaneous emphysema of the lower eyelid, sometimes resulting from an effort to blow the nose or sneeze (intrasinusal hyperpressure).
