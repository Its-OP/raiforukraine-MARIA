the patient generally reports a cracking sound during the trauma (direct impact on the nose)

* Epistaxis due to a wound in the richly vascularised nasal mucosa.
* Initial pain, decreasing later, exacerbated by mobilisation.
* Ecchymosis and oedema,
* Deformity of the nasal pyramid, more or less pronounced, to be characterised in the frontal and sagittal planes.
* Nasal obstruction: this can be demonstrated by having the patient breathe out through the nose over a mirror (known as the Glatzel mirror). Anterior rhinoscopy (with a speculum) can show simple oedema of the mucosa, a mucosal wound or even a haematoma of the septum, which is a therapeutic emergency.
