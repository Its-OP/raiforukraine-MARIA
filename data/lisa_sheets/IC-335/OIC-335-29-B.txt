The facial CT scan, without injection, with reconstruction in 3 planes and 3D, allows a precise assessment of fractures, while limiting patient radiation. It can be performed at the same time as a whole-body scan in polytrauma patients; a brain scan is often combined with the injection of iodinated contrast.

In addition to assessing the lesions, CT scans can detect an associated intra-orbital or intracranial haematoma, a pneumocele indicating a meningeal breach, and provide a precise assessment of intra-orbital and nasal lesions prior to surgical reconstruction.

The scanner is the basis for computer-assisted surgical procedures sometimes used to treat Le Fort fractures (Planning, Navigation and Customised Implantable Medical Devices).

Haemostasis and anaemia tests, and pre-transfusion tests are often required in this context.
