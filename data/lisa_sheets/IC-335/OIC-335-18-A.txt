* ecchymosis and periorbital oedema, which may be severe and interfere with palpebral opening.
* subcutaneous emphysema, in the event of inappropriate nose blowing (which should be avoided)
* enophthalmos, possibly associated with dystopia (hypoglobia)
* binocular diplopia
* limitation of globe elevation, possibly associated with signs of vagal activation (sweating, lipothymia, tachycardia, etc.): these clinical signs indicate incarceration of the inferior rectus muscle (in the case of a "trapdoor" fracture); this is a surgical emergency
* a drop in visual acuity, or blindness at the most, raises fears of associated trauma to the globe and/or an intra-orbital haematoma, which are surgical emergencies.
