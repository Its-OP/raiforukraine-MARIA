======1-'''Formes localisées'''======
====Atteinte du membre supérieur ou syndrome épaule-main, et du membre inférieur :====
- Shoulder-hand syndrome combines pain, vasomotor disorders, and joint stiffness in the shoulder and hand. Elbow involvement is rarely described. It frequently occurs in the aftermath of hemiplegia (rapid onset after stroke).

- Lower limb involvement usually involves the ankle or foot.

- Hip involvement is rare, more often in men, but can also occur in the third trimester of pregnancy. MRI is essential in order not to miss a subchondral fracture or incipient hip osteonecrosis.

- We describe ''fragmentary forms'' (Figure 1), limited to a joint segment (patella, metacarpal, etc.), as well as ''extensive forms'', ''plurifocal''.

======2-''Hot, cold and atrophic forms'''======
- '''Hot form:''' this is the onset phase, often brutal, in the aftermath of the trauma. It can last from a few days to a few months. It manifests as a warm, erythrosic oedema, sometimes erythrocyanotic, and hypersudation. Pain and functional impotence are significant. Analgesic treatment must begin at this stage.

- '''Cold form:''' it begins around the fourth month. The skin is cold and cyanotic. Skin disorders appear as well as trophic skin disorders, which are sometimes severe. The pain may be permanent or only occur when the joints are moved. There are cold forms from the outset. These forms are more common in children.

- '''Sequellar atrophic form:''' SDCR at this stage is no longer progressive. The atrophic sequelae concern the skin, muscles and appendages. There is aponeurotic retraction and joint stiffness, without permanent or provoked pain.
