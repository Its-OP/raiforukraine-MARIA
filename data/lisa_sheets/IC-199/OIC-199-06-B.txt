'''Rang B'''

'''Section: Additional examinations'''

'''Entitulé : Knowing the imaging tests to order when there is a suspicion of CRDS'''

'''Descriptif : Radiographies (en 1ère intention) ; IRM et scintigraphie osseuse'''

- '''The diagnosis of CRDS is clinical.'''

- '''There is no additional pathognomonic test for CRDS'''

- Additional tests are carried out to rule out differential diagnoses.

- Biological tests were normal, ruling out an infectious or inflammatory etiology (normal ESR and CRP).

- Joint fluid is a mechanical fluid.

- Imaging examinations may be normal without rejecting the diagnosis. They are of no use in monitoring the course of the disease and should not influence the indication for treatment.''


1- X-rays

'''.     X-rays must be comparative''''

.     Local and regional hypertransparency of the bone pieces may be observed due to trabecular rarefaction and cortical resorption.

.     X-rays may be normal throughout the course of the disease. Since CRPS is a diagnosis of elimination, it is important to remember the importance of negative signs: absence of pinching of the joint space, absence of erosions, etc.

.     Radiological healing may be accompanied by "ad integro" restitution, but pseudo-dystrophic anomalies may persist after healing.  


2- Technetium bone scan

- Scintigraphy is of no benefit either for the clinical diagnosis of CRDS or for assessing the progression of the disease.

- However, hyperfixation can be observed in the early vascular phase and late hyperfixation in the bone phase.

- Scintigraphy can assess locoregional extension.

- Scintigraphic hypofixation may occur, particularly in children and adolescents, in so-called cold forms from the outset, and may be encouraged by under-use of the limb (off-loading, plaster cast).

- It ensures that an underlying cause, in particular a crack or fracture, is not overlooked.

- A normal scintigraphy does not rule out the diagnosis of CRDS.

3- MRI

- MRI in CRPS should remain the exception and may be performed to rule out differential diagnoses of bone oedema or other joint pathologies.

- During CRDS, certain non-specific MRI abnormalities may be observed: bone oedema (T1 hyposignal, T2 STIR hypersignal, T2 FAT SAT), intra-articular effusion (T2 hypersignal), soft tissue oedema (T2 FAT SAT hypersignal, enhanced by gadolinium).

'''A normal MRI does not rule out the diagnosis of CRDS.'''
