Title: Contributing factors

Description : none


'''<u>Traumatic factors+++</u>'''''

- Trauma, even minor trauma, can be the cause of CRPS (surgery, fracture, sprain, etc.).

- There is no relationship between the intensity of the trauma and the intensity of the symptoms.

- The time taken for symptoms to appear varies, but is generally no more than three months.


'''<u>Neurological conditions</u>''''

- Central: stroke, meningeal haemorrhage, brain tumour, multiple sclerosis

- Peripheral: peripheral nerve damage.


'''<u>Tumor pathologies</u>''''

- Intra-thoracic tumours, leukaemia, lymphoma.


'''<u>Visceral or metabolic pathologies</u>''''

- Myocardial infarction, phlebitis, arthritis, diabetes, hypertriglyceridaemia, hypothyroidism.


There are no psychological triggers, but as in all chronic pain syndromes, vulnerability factors, certain psychological conditions (thymic disorders) or psychopathology can contribute to the chronicisation of pain.
