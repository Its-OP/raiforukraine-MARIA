'''Title: Incidence, Prevalence of CRDS''''

'''Description : A few figures about the SDRC'''


- The incidence is not well known and is estimated at 25/100,000 inhabitants.

- Prevalence is around 20/100,000 inhabitants (USA)

- The ratio of women to men is 3:1.

- 10% of CRDS are idiopathic, and up to 40% occur after a fracture event.

- The average age of onset is generally 40-50 years, although CRPS may occur in children.

The upper and lower limbs are affected in the same way (note the discrepancy with the PRM college, which states that the upper limbs are more often affected).
