'''Description : Principles and first-line treatments'''


1- '''Rehabilitation management'''

- Functional rehabilitation is the essential and indispensable element in the treatment of CRPS.

- Treatment must be given as early as possible to avoid under-utilisation of the limb concerned and the onset of trophic disorders.

- Satisfactory pain relief (if necessary medication) should facilitate rehabilitation and enable it to begin quickly.

- Educational care helps patients to understand their condition better and to adhere more effectively to the various treatments on offer.

- '''Progression in adults and children is generally satisfactory if treatment is started early and the patient is actively put back into motion.'''

- Follow-up physiotherapy (whatever the condition) and occupational therapy (if the upper limb is affected) are indicated. A variety of analytical exercises are performed, if necessary in a rehabilitation centre for the most severe cases. Efforts are made to prevent capsular and tendon retractions, drain soft tissue oedema and avoid functional exclusion of the affected limb.


2- '''Management of medication'''

- It should facilitate functional rehabilitation.

- Paracetamol and weak opioids may be offered. Their efficacy should be regularly assessed, as should their tolerability and possible misuse.

- The presence of allodynia and hyperalgesia suggestive of central sensitisation may lead to the use of antidepressants and antiepileptics in the treatment of CRPS as for neuropathic pain (see item 135).

- Strong opioids, NSAIDs and corticosteroids should not be used in CRPS without specialist advice from a rheumatologist, rehabilitation specialist or algologist'' (chronic pain structure).


3- Non-invasive neurostimulation techniques

- '''Transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation''' may be offered in conjunction with rehabilitation.

- It is prescribed by a pain doctor (see item 135).

- The analgesic effect may make it easier to resume physical exercise. Improvement is highly variable and unpredictable.


4- Psychological care

.      Even if patients with CRPS have no particular psychological functioning, they may have particular personality traits and a vulnerability to pain.

.      Multidisciplinary care, which is necessary from the moment a patient becomes chronic, must take into account anxiety, physical problems and medico-legal issues.

.      Treatment by a clinical psychologist places the pain in the patient's history, mobilises elements of trust, recognises axio-depressive elements and can encourage the use of psycho-corporal techniques.

5- Spinal cord stimulation

For ''severe CRDS refractory to conventional treatments'', and after multidisciplinary assessment in a chronic pain structure, spinal cord stimulation may be proposed (validated for refractory CRDS) (see item 135).
