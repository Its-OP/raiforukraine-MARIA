'''Title: terminology and definition'''


. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is defined by joint and periarticular pain associated with sensitivity disorders, vasomotor, sudomotor, muscular and trophic disorders. It often appears after a fracture or minor trauma.

. Pain is essential to the diagnosis; it is regional, indicating the possible extension of symptoms, sometimes to an entire limb; it is complex, reflecting the variability of symptoms in terms of location, presentation and time.

. CRPS I: formerly algodystrophy. There is no evidence of peripheral nerve damage.

. CRPS II: a peripheral nerve lesion is identified. Symptoms may follow a neurological pattern.

The course of the disease is unpredictable, and the persistence of symptoms, particularly pain, can have a major impact on function and quality of life.
