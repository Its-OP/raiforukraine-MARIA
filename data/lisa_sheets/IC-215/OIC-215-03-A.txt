==Infectious illness: purpura ''fulminans''==
Purpura ''fulminans

*rapid extension (a few minutes or hours) in size and number of a vascular purpura, with at least one necrotic or ecchymotic element over 3 mm in diameter, associated with sepsis or septic shock
*most often secondary to bacterial meningococcal or pneumococcal infection, which may (but not always) be part of infectious meningitis.


The clinical signs to look for in favour of "fulminans" purpura are :

- '''Fever ([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]])'''

- Signs of haemodynamic failure ([[Discovery of arterial hypotension SD-043|'''hypotension''']], mottling, polypnoea, collapse, oligoanuria, etc.).

- Neurological signs (obnubilation, [[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|'''coma'''']], meningeal syndrome). Note that the meningeal syndrome may be absent.

- Necrotic and/or ecchymotic and/or extensive purpura (physical examination to be carried out with the patient in underwear).


Vital prognosis is at stake (death in 20% of cases under treatment) and treatment is urgent and hospital-based. It consists of :

- As a matter of urgency, and before any examination: intra-muscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) injection of antibiotics (preferably 3rd generation cephalosporin: cefotaxime or ceftriaxone);

- Perform blood cultures (if possible and without delaying the injection of the first dose of antibiotic);

- Carry out a biological check-up (detailed below);

- The use of droplet precautions (surgical mask) during treatment.


Lumbar puncture is "contraindicated" until the coagulation disorder has been corrected.


== Haemorrhagic emergency: profound thrombocytopenia ==


Profound thrombocytopenia is defined as a circulating platelet count of less than 20,000 platelets/mm<sup>3</sup> and is associated with a significant and serious risk of haemorrhage (''[[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]]'').


The signs of seriousness to look for are

- Purpura of the mucous membranes: haemorrhagic bullae of the mucous membranes (endo-buccal), gingivorrhagia reflecting a high risk of haemorrhage.

- Epistaxis, macroscopic haematuria.

- Meno-metrorrhagia ('''[[Abnormal genital bleeding (excluding known pregnancy) SD-112|abnormal genital bleeding]] (excluding known pregnancy)''').

- Digestive haemorrhage ('''[[Melena/rectorrhagia SD-010|melena/rectorrhagia]]''', haematemesis '''([[Blood emission through mouth SD-014|blood emission through mouth]]))''''

- Signs suggesting intracranial bleeding (headache, confusion, coma, focal deficit, convulsive seizure).

Treatment depends on the cause and the degree of urgency.
