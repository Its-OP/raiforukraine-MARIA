==''In case of thrombocytopenic purpura'''==
- Blood count (in the case of purpura, there is no need to check for thrombocytopenia (platelet abnormality) on a citrate tube, as there are clinical signs associated with thrombocytopenia);

- Search for a ''decrease in the prothrombin rate (PT)'', or a ''prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)'', fibrinogen (in search of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC));

- '''Blood smear ([[Prescription and analysis of blood smear SD-222|prescription and analysis of blood smear]]);'''

- Liver function tests ;

- Blood group, test for irregular agglutinins (which will enable a platelet or red blood cell transfusion to be carried out if necessary).

In case of '''fever ([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]) and/or new heart murmur ([[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation]])''':

'''prescription of blood cultures ([[Positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]).'''
<br />

- '''C-reactive protein (CRP) ([[c-reactive protein (cr) elevation SD-203|C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation])'''''
