Two main mechanisms:

- '''Vascular purpura = pathology of the vascular wall'' = most often infiltrated

o by inflammation of the wall (vasculitis)

o by fragility of the capillary vascular wall

- '''Thrombocytopenic purpura''' = '''primary haemostasis disorder''' (especially thrombocytopenia ('''[[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]]'''), possibly thrombopathy) = usually non-infiltrated and non-confluent

|Vascular purpura of vasculitis
|'''Vascular purpura due to capillary fragility*'''''
|'''Thrombocytopenic purpura'''
|-
|Mechanism
|Inflammation of the vascular wall
|Fragility of the vascular wall
|Thrombocytopenia (platelet abnormality) (more rarely thrombopathy)
|-
|Usual clinical appearance
|infiltrated, sometimes necrotic
|Non-infiltrated, non-necrotic
|Non-infiltrated, non-necrotic
|-
|Distribution
|Declive, predominantly in the lower limbs

Aggravated by orthostatism

No mucosal involvement
|No elevation, areas of friction (perifollicular in scurvy)

Mucosal involvement possible (gingivorrhagia)
|May affect all areas but predominates in declining areas

Mucosal damage possible
|-
|''Other bleeding sites'''
|No
|Yes (gingivorrhagia possible in scurvy)
|Yes

(haematomas, ecchymoses, epistaxis, gingivorrhages, intra-oral haemorrhagic bullae or visceral haemorrhages)
