==Main causes of vascular purpura===

===Infectious causes===
- Purpura fulminans

- Infective endocarditis<br />.

===Vascularity===

==== Small-calibre vasculitides====
- ANCA-associated vasculitides (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis) [[Know the main types of systemic vasculitides 2C-193-DE-B01|(systemic vasculitides)])

- Immune complex vasculitis (cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, IgA vasculitis (formerly rheumatoid purpura), post-infectious vasculitis)

- Cutaneous vasculitis (often drug-induced)<br />.

==== Medium-calibre vasculitis====
Periarteritis nodosa


NB: Purpura is never present in large-vessel vasculitis.

===Capillary fragility===
- Bateman's purpura senile (purpura secondary to capillary fragility in the elderly)

- Endogenous or iatrogenic hypercorticism

- Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) (undernutrition/malnutrition)<br />.

==Main causes of thrombocytopenic purpura==
The main causes are :

- Defect in platelet production in the bone marrow: central thrombocytopenia

- Immunological: immunological thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) ([[Thrombocytopenia in adults and children|Thrombocytopenia in adults and children]])

- Platelet consumption: associated haemostasis disorder (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy (haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). These 2 causes constitute an emergency.

- Platelet dysfunction (thrombopathy) without thrombocytopenia (e.g. secondary to antiplatelet medication).
