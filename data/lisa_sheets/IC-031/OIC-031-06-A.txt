At the end of labour, there are several stages in the birth process, including the engagement phase of the foetal mobile, the descent phase and the expulsion phase, also known as the release phase.

The woman can push with each uterine contraction and relax between them.

As the body expels, the head settles under the symphysis and then deflects, revealing the frontal humps, eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

Once the head is free, it rotates back spontaneously. Downward traction is used to release the anterior shoulder. The posterior shoulder is then released by pulling upwards. Releasing the rest of the body poses no problem.
