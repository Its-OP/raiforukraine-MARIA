== Definition
Childbirth is the physiological process that leads to the expulsion of the placenta and membranes. It completes childbirth. Delivery is the 3rd stage of childbirth.

== Physiology
Delivery takes place in three stages.

==== 1) Delamination ====

==== 2) Expulsion ====
- the placenta is usually presented to the vulval orifice by its foetal side (Baudelocque mode);

- sometimes the maternal side or one of the edges appears first (Duncan mode).

==== 3) Haemostasis ====
This is ensured by :

- by uterine retraction

- Vessel thrombosis, involving coagulation factors.

== Clinical ==

=== Reappearance of uterine contractions after clinical remission ===
- the uterine fundus rises above the umbilicus,

- the umbilical cord unwinds at the vulva and a little blood flows out,

=== Expulsion of the placenta ===
- it may be spontaneous, during an expulsive effort or by impaling the uterine fundus

- After delivery, the uterus forms the safety globe.

=== Respecting the physiological mechanism ===
Do not pull on the cord or manoeuvre it too hastily.

== Examination of the placenta
- Search for an aberrant cotyledon

- The place of insertion of the cord is noted on the foetal surface, and the presence of two funicular arteries and one funicular vein is checked.

- On the mother's side, the cotyledons must be juxtaposed without any continuity.

Artificial delivery must be performed in the event of an incomplete placenta, immediate post-partum haemorrhage, or failure to deliver within 30 minutes.

== Fourth stage of labour
During this phase, known as the return to normal, the mother must be constantly monitored in the delivery room for 2 hours.

Heart rate, BP, uterine retraction (uterine height and tone) and blood loss are monitored.

Uterine expression will be performed 2 or 3 times during this period.

Immediate post-partum haemorrhage, defined as a volume of blood loss equal to or greater than 500 ml, is one of the most frequent causes of maternal mortality in France '''([[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|Acute haemorrhage]], [[Abnormal post-partum genital bleeding SD-110|Annormal post-partum genital bleeding]])'''.
