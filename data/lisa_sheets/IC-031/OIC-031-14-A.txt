The "post-natal period" covers the entire period from childbirth to the reappearance of menstruation ("return from childbirth").

==Physiology==

===Uterine evolution===
Under the influence of sub-clinical uterine contractions (UC), the uterus decreases in volume and re-enters the pelvic cavity. These contractions are painful in multiparous women ("trenches").

The uterus, which is large and globular for the first 15 days, returns to its normal size in 2 to 3 months. There is a physiological serosanguinolent discharge ("lochia"), which is bloody for the first few days and gradually clears.

Uterine involution varies according to the prescription of oxytocics and whether or not the mother is breast-feeding.

===Return from childbirth===
In the absence of breastfeeding and oestroprogestogen treatment, the return of labour occurs around the 45th day post-partum (6 to 12 weeks).

Occasionally, a small amount of haemorrhage may be observed around day 20 for 2 to 3 days, this is known as the '''petit retour de couches''' ''([[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|Acute haemorrhage]], [[Abnormal postpartum genital bleeding SD-110|Abnormal postpartum genital bleeding)]'''.

Reconstitution of the endometrium takes place in 3 phases:

- regression phase: 4 to 5 days, degeneration of the uterine decidua ;

- healing phase: until day 25;

- proliferation phase: 25-45<sup>th</sup> day.

If breast-feeding is used, the endometrium retains a regressive, resting appearance and the return of childbirth occurs in 4 to 6 months.

The 1st<sup>cycle</sup> may be ovulatory.

The return from childbirth occurs around 40 days (6 weeks) after the end of breastfeeding.
