== Settling the patient
Fetal heart sounds and uterine contractions continue to be monitored during expulsion.

The bladder must be emptied beforehand.

== Pushing technique
Voluntary expulsive efforts must be concomitant with EC. The patient must inhale, blow out, then inhale, hold her breath, chin forward and push effectively downwards for the duration of the contraction.

You can also use the push and exhale technique.

The patient should rest and relax between each CU, breathing widely and deeply.

== Release Technique
When the head starts to deflect. The perineum bulges, the surgeon will then be able to control the expulsion.

A hand placed on the top of the head prevents the head from coming out abruptly. The progressive deflection of the foetal head allows the operator's other hand to search for the chin.

When the head is out, check that there is no cord circular.

Once the head is free, it rotates spontaneously, bringing it into a position that is adapted to that of the back and shoulders. The operator must accentuate this restitution in order to encourage engagement and descent of the posterior shoulder.

The surgeon then gently pulls in the umbilical-coccygeal axis, and when the anterior shoulder is fixed under the symphysis, the axis becomes horizontal, the posterior shoulder reaches the vulvar fork and the anterior shoulder is released. The child is then lifted vertically and anteriorly, keeping an eye on the perineum to release the posterior shoulder.
