==Bone girdle==
The pelvic girdle is a symmetrical osteoarticular ring made up of :

- 4 pieces of bone :

- the 2 hip bones,

- the sacrum,

- the coccyx ;

- 4 joints, very little mobility :

- the 2 sacroiliac joints,

- the pubic symphysis,

- the sacrococcygeal joint.
<br />

===Upper strait===
This is Demelin's "engagement cylinder".

This cylinder is limited :

- at the top by the anatomical upper strait defined by the plane passing through the upper edge of the pubic symphysis and the promontory

- inferiorly by the superior obstetrical strait defined by the plane passing through the innominate lines, the retropubic point of the pubic symphysis (margella) and the anterior face of the 1<sup>rst</sup> sacral piece (S1).


The DS is narrowed in the sagittal plane by the protrusion of the promontory, and is shaped like the heart of a playing card. The axis of the DS is oblique posteriorly and inferiorly.

===Pelvic excavation===
Between the engagement cylinder and the lower orifice of the pelvis, the excavation (or pelvic canal) is formed by the anterior surface of the sacrum and coccyx and the posterior surface of the pubis.


Where the lower third and upper two thirds meet, there is an oblique plane running downwards and forwards through the two sciatic spines: this is the middle strait (MS).

===Inferior Dent (ID)===
This is the lower orifice of the pelvic canal, defined as the space between the plane of the DM and the planes of the DI.

This space is a triangular prism:

- the upper surface is represented by the plane of the DM ;

- the anterior surface, oblique downwards and backwards, joins the lower edge of the pubis to the ischium, following the ischiopubic branches;

- the posterior surface, which slopes upwards and backwards, is determined by the 2 ischials and the tip of the coccyx.

==Soft basin==
It is made up of :

- the vagina ;

- the pelviperineal diaphragm: a musculotendinous hammock comprising :

- a deep plane: bundles of the levator ani muscle and sacrotuberous ligament,

- a superficial level: muscles of the superficial perineum.
