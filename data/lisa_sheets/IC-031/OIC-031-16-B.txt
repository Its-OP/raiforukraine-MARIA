The immediate post-partum period is a good time to address the issue of birth control.

It should be noted that 5.5% of all abortions in France take place within 6 months of childbirth ('''[[Request for voluntary interruption of pregnancy SD-332|Demand for voluntary interruption of pregnancy]]''').

==When to start contraception?==
Fertility returns early after childbirth and effective contraception should be started no later than 21 days after childbirth (''[[Prescribe contraception and emergency contraception SD-257|Prescribe contraception and emergency contraception]]'').

Postnatal contraception is provisional and should be discussed again at the postnatal visit.

==Choosing a contraceptive method===

=====Non-medical methods: Ogino and Knaus, Billing=====
Their effectiveness is highly controversial in normal circumstances, and their use in the post-partum period is strongly discouraged.

=====Barrières=====
Sexual activity can resume as soon as the perineum is comfortable and healed and the pale red blood has disappeared.

The following methods can be used:

- spermicides in the form of creams, ova, sponges ;

- condoms.

The diaphragm is more difficult to use.

=====Contraception intra-utérine=====
Inserting an IUD within a few days is safe and does not increase the risk of infection or perforation.

This is the ideal method of contraception for breastfeeding women.

=====Contraceptifs hormonaux=====

======Œstroprogestatifs (OP)======
OP contraceptives should not be prescribed in the 6 weeks following childbirth, whether or not the woman is breastfeeding.

As OPs have been little evaluated in the context of breastfeeding, they are not favoured in this context.

======Microgestatifs======
They are prescribed continuously with no metabolic or systemic repercussions.

The main disadvantages are metrorrhagia and spotting.

They do not alter the parameters of breastfeeding.

======Implants progestatifs======
The implant can be prescribed in the immediate post-partum period, does not interfere with lactation and, like oral microprogestins, does not increase the risk of thromboembolism.

===Sterilisation===
Sterilisation can be an alternative to contraception if the woman, well informed beforehand, wishes to undergo it. The post-partum period is a favourable time for sterilisation, and does not lengthen the hospital stay.

It can be done :

- at the time of a caesarean section;

- within 24-48 hours after an uncomplicated delivery.

==Contraception and breastfeeding==
Breastfeeding, even if exclusive, does not provide sufficient contraception.

Only exclusive breastfeeding under very specific conditions (the LAM method) can be used for contraceptive purposes for a period of 6 months.
