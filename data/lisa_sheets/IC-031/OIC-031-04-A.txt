The ''[[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|uterine contraction in a pregnant woman]]'' (UC) is the driving force behind childbirth; it causes the cervix to dilate and the foetus to pass through the birth canal.

==Means of study==
The mechanical study of EC is commonly used in obstetrics thanks to monitors which allow simultaneous recording of the foetal heart rate and uterine contractions:

- external tocography is used to record the duration and frequency of CU ;

- internal tocography to obtain basic tone and intrauterine pressure

==Role and effects==

===Formation and enlargement of the lower segment===
A temporary formation that only appears in the 3rd<sup>trimester</sup> of pregnancy, the lower segment is developed between the body and the cervix at the expense of the uterine isthmus: this is the incision zone for transverse segmental caesarean sections.

===Effacement and dilation of the uterine cervix===
EC in labour leads to :

- shortening of the neck to the point of obliteration;

- Dilatation is then progressive until complete dilatation (10 cm).

===Formation of the water sac===
During labour, the membranes separate. The water sac thus formed is the portion of the membranes uncovered by the dilation of the cervix.

Its role is twofold:

- Protects against infection and trauma

- mechanical aid for cervical dilatation.

===Effects of EC on the foetal mobile===
Under the effect of uterine contractions, the foetal motile will cross the levels of the birth canal:

- upper strait ;

- pelvic excavation ;

- lower strait ;

- perineum.
