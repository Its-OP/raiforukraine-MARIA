A woman's stay in the maternity unit allows her to :

- check that the uterus is involving properly and that there is no haemorrhage''([[Abnormal postpartum genital bleeding SD-110|Abnormal postpartum genital bleeding]])''' ;

- control breast-feeding ;

- prevent and detect local and general infections, as well as thromboembolic accidents;

- take care of the perineum ;

- provide good medical information and carry out certain preventive actions.

1 Uterine involution

The uterus must be retracted and toned: a "safety globe". Uterine involution must be monitored daily and may be encouraged by oxytocics.

2 Breastfeeding ([[Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding SD-273|Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding]])

(''See specific question)''

3 Prevention of infections and thromboembolic events ([[Prescription and monitoring of treatment with anticoagulants and/or anti-aggregants SD-248|Prescription and monitoring of treatment with anticoagulants and/or anti-aggregants)]]

Monitoring and prophylaxis are based on :

- temperature and pulse curves ;

- examination of vaginal discharge ;

- early detection of clinical signs of urinary tract or other infections;

- getting up early;

- correction of any anaemia.

Depending on the patient's risk of thromboembolism, she may be offered compression stockings with or without anticoagulant treatment for up to 6 weeks post-partum.

4 Perineum care

This involves frequent toileting and avoiding maceration. Pelvic re-education is not systematic.
