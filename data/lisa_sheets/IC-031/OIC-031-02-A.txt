The foetus, curled up on itself, forms an ovoid with 2 poles

== Fetal head
The foetal head is ovoid in shape, with the small end corresponding to the chin and the large end to the occiput.


We describe :

- longitudinal suture ;

- This longitudinal suture is joined by two other transverse sutures:

- one before,

- the other posterior ;

- At the intersections of the longitudinal suture with these last two sutures, there are two fontanelles:

- the anterior fontanel or bregma,

- the posterior fontanel or lambda.
