The pregnant uterus is made up of 3 parts: the body, the lower segment (the portion of the uterus that distends at the end of pregnancy) and the cervix (which itself contains 2 orifices: one external and one internal).

The uterus is made up of three tunics:

- the serosa

- the mucous membrane transformed into deciduous tissue during pregnancy;

- the muscularis or myometrium: the bundles of smooth muscle fibres are arranged in two circular layers, external and internal, on either side of the plexiform layer, whose bundles enclose numerous vessels. In a retracted uterus, the retraction of the fibres erases the lumen of the vessels, which has the effect of reducing the haemorrhage of normal delivery: this is the phenomenon of living ligatures.
