== Definition
It is the crossing of the DS by the largest circumference of the presentation.

The presentation is then said to be engaged

== Clinical ==
Involvement is diagnosed by questioning, inspection, abdominal palpation and vaginal touch.

=== Abdominal palpation ===

=== Vaginal touch ===
He is looking for :

- Farabeuf's sign: the foetal head is engaged when only 2 fingers fit between the foetal cephalic pole and the sacrococcygeal plane;

- Demelin's sign: the foetal head is engaged when the index finger, inserted perpendicular to the anterior surface of the pubic symphysis, comes up against the presentation.


It is also possible to determine the descent of the presentation in relation to the level of the sciatic spines (level 0). If the vertex is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 cm above this level, the presentation is said to be at levels -1, -2, -3, -4 or -5. Below the level of the sciatic spines, it is level + 1, + 2, + 3, + 4 or + 5.
