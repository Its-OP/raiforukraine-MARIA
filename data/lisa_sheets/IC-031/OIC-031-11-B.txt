== Definition of expulsion ==
This is the 3<sup>th</sup> time of the 2<sup>th</sup> stage of childbirth. It begins when the fetal head is at the lower part of the excavation and ends with the birth of the child.
<br />

== Physiology of cephalic release ==
From a dynamic point of view, the maternal abdominal thrust reinforces the uterine contraction and the desire to push is determined by the contact of the presentation with the pelviperineal floor.

There are 3 stages in the removal of the foetal head:

- distension of the posterior perineum

- distension of the anterior perineum

- presentation clearance
