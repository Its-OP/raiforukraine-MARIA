Epistaxis is active bleeding from the nasal cavity (anterior epistaxis) and/or the posterior pharyngeal wall (posterior epistaxis).

The severity of epistaxis depends on :

*Abundance and duration of bleeding,
*Repetition of haemorrhagic episodes,
*Fragility of the patient (age, cardiovascular condition, pre-existing blood depletion induced by another aetiology).

When epistaxis is accompanied by respiratory signs (cough, dyspnoea, sputum) or digestive signs (vomiting, nausea), the differential diagnoses to be ruled out are haemoptysis and haematemesis respectively.
