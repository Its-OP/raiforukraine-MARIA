'''The first stage of management aims to assess the severity of the epistaxis by specifying:'''

Through questioning :

*Abundance (a few traces of blood in one or more glasses),
*Duration (from a few seconds to several minutes),
*Repetition of episodes (over several hours or days),
*Risk factors (age, pre-existing impairment of general condition),
*Risk history (cardiovascular disease, haemostasis disorders, arterial hypertension, antithrombotic treatment, Rendu Osler disease).

Clinical examination :

*Signs of haemorrhagic shock (tachycardia, arterial hypotension, confusion, pallor, mottling),
*Signs of bronchial congestion related to possible inhalation (cough, sputum, bronchial rales, polypnoea, desaturation, sweating, agitation).

'''The second stage of management aims to find the etiology of the epistaxis:'''

*Accidental or polytraumatic context,
*Recent nasosinus surgery,
*Malignant tumour pathologies (pre-existing unilateral nasal obstruction, involvement of the cranial pairs, altered general condition, high-risk profession (woodworking)), or benign (nasopharyngeal fibroma in adolescents),
*Rendu Osler disease (frequent epistaxis since childhood, family history, mucocutaneous telangiectasia).

'''The third stage of management is to look for comorbidities likely to aggravate epistaxis:'''

*Antithrombotic treatment (anti-vitamin K, platelet anti-aggregants, new anticoagulants such as "xabans"),
*Diseases responsible for haemostasis disorders (haemopathies, liver failure, kidney failure, coagulation factor deficiencies, autoimmune diseases).
*Arterial hypertension (current anti-HA treatments).
