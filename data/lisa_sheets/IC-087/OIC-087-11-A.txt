*This is the ''tamponade technique to be proposed as 1st<sup> intention''.
*It is performed on a seated patient after blowing the nose to evacuate clots.
*The nasal cavity is first soaked with a local anaesthetic solution (spray or cotton wool) if there are no contraindications.
*The material used may or may not be absorbable. If available, absorbable material is preferred in cases of coagulopathy or Rendu Osler disease.
*The drill bit is inserted with a pair of forceps along the floor of the nasal cavity and pushed into the posterior part of the nasal cavity. It is then compressed from back to front.
*The non-absorbable anterior tamponade is left in place for 24 to 48 hours and its effectiveness is checked regularly by an oral examination of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
