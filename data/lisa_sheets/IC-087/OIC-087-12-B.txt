*It is recommended after anterior tamponade has failed.
*It allows compression of both the nasal cavity and the emergence of the sphenopalatine artery to reduce blood flow to the naso-sinusal mucosa.
*The double balloon probe has replaced anteroposterior tamponade with a compress, which is performed under general anaesthetic.
*It is performed on a patient in a sitting position after blowing the nose to evacuate clots.
*The nasal cavity is first soaked in a local anaesthetic solution (spray or cotton wool) if there are no contraindications.
*The tightness of the 2 balloons is checked before the probe is inserted.
*The probe is inserted along the floor of the nasal cavity. The posterior balloon is first inflated with water for injection and then the anterior balloon.
*The tube should be deflated after 24 to 48 hours, and its effectiveness checked regularly by examining the posterior pharyngeal wall in the mouth.
