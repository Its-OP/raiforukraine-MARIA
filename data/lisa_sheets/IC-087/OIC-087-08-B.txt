The impact of hypertension on the occurrence of epistaxis is controversial. High blood pressure is thought to be associated above all with the risk of recurrence of epistaxis.

* During the initial clinical examination of an epistaxis, an elevated BP may be associated with patient stress and should be checked 30 minutes later to confirm.
* If an elevated BP is confirmed, treatment with calcium channel blockers in electric syringe or tablet form may be necessary if there are no contraindications.
* A cardiological opinion is recommended if this initial management strategy fails.
* At a distance from the epistaxis, the patient's BP should be reassessed by the attending physician.
* If the patient is already known to be hypertensive, a reassessment of background treatment is recommended at a distance from the epistaxis.
