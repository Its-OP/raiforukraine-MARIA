The prevalence of breastfeeding in maternity hospitals in France is ''around 70%'' (around 60% exclusive breastfeeding and 10% partial breastfeeding). The median duration of breastfeeding in France is 15 weeks.

The factors that have a negative influence on breastfeeding fall into 5 categories:

- Factors linked to the mother : young" mother, single, "low socio-economic status", recent immigrant mother, moving close to the birth, "primiparity", first experience of breastfeeding, "negative past experience of breastfeeding", ambivalence or lack of desire to breastfeed, late decision to breastfeed, "lack of knowledge about breastfeeding", perception of insufficient milk, uncertainty about the quantity of milk taken, ''lack of self-confidence'', lack of confidence in her ability to breastfeed, embarrassment when breastfeeding in public, ''postnatal depression'', breastfeeding difficulties, early use of a dummy, ''smoking'', ''obesity'' and ''occupation'';

- Factors linked to the newborn and its state of health: weight loss > 10%, "poor weight gain", "sucking problems";

- Factors linked to the environment: ''lack of support'' ''from the partner'', negative perception from the father ;

- Factors linked to the organisation of maternity care: ''delayed initiation of breastfeeding'', ''delayed first skin-to-skin'', breastfeeding ''at fixed times'', use of artificial milk supplements in the maternity unit, lack of awareness and ''lack of support from professionals'';

- Health policy factors: "short and poorly paid" maternity leave.
