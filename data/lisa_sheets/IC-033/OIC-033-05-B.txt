== '''Insufficient milk''' ==

- '''Arbitrary limitation''' of the frequency or duration of feeds;

- '''Complement''';

- '''Blocked milk duct''' ('''73. [Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]''''[[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|)]]]: associated with engorgement corresponding to the blocked duct area.

== '''Crevasses''' ==
Mechanisms and contributing factors: '''abnormal friction'' between the nipple and the newborn's mouth ('''poor latch on'', sucking problems or tongue curl that is too short).

== '''Mastitis (lymphangitis or galactophoritis)''' ==
Mechanisms and contributing factors :

- '''Milk stasis and engorgement''' ;

- '''Superinfected crevices.'''
