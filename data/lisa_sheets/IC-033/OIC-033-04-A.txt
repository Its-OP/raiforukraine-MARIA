'''Milk insufficiency''''

Main cause of early cessation of breastfeeding.


'''Engorgement mammaire'''

Definition: milk stasis leading to an increase in intra-alveolar pressure with oedema and inflammation, all of which prevents milk flow and quality feedings.

Diagnosis (''164. [[Breast clinical examination abnormality SD-164|Breast clinical examination abnormality]]'') :

- Breast '''swollen''' ('''9. [[Parietal mass/tumefaction SD-009|Parietal mass/tumefaction]]'''[[Parietal mass/tumefaction SD-009|)]], '''tense''', '''painful''' ('''73. [[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]'''[[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|)]], '''shiny''' with oedema or even '''diffuse redness''' ('''85. [[Erythema SD-085|Erythema]]''') ''';''''

- Little or no fever;

- '''No paraclinical examination''' is indicated in this situation: '''clinical''' diagnosis ('''178. [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]''').


'''Crevasses'''

Definition: breakdown of the skin barrier.

Diagnosis (''164. [[Breast clinical examination abnormality SD-164|Breast clinical examination abnormality]]'') :

- '''Sore nipple''' ('''73. [[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]''') without skin signs then becomes '''red''' ('''85. [[Erythema SD-085|Erythema]]'''[[Erythema SD-085|)]], irritated and finally appear '''cracks''' and '''skin erosions''' ;

- Bleeding (''40. [[Nipple discharge SD-040|Nipple discharge]]'').


'''Mastitis (lymphangitis or galactophoritis)'''

Definition: inflammation of the breast with or without infection.

- Lymphangitis = inflammatory mastitis;

- Galactophoritis = infectious mastitis.

Diagnosis :

- The clinic

- Between the '''2<sup>ème</sup> and 12<sup>ème</sup>''' week postpartum;

- '''Flu syndrome''' with '''fever''' above 38.5 °C ('''44. [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Hyperthermia/fever]]'''), chills, sudden onset, associated with '''pain''' in one breast ('''73. [Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]'') ;

- On clinical examination (''164. [[Breast clinical examination abnormality SD-164|Breast clinical examination abnormality]]'''), the breast presents a red ('''85. [[Erythema SD-085|Erythema]]''') and indurated ('''9. [[Parietal mass/tumefaction SD-009|Parietal mass/tumefaction]]'''), sometimes with an associated lymph node;

- Clinical signs do not differentiate between infectious and non-infectious mastitis. The presence of ''pus in the milk'' (Budin's sign) (''40. [[Nipple discharge SD-040|Nipple discharge]]'') is nevertheless '''in favour of galactophoritis''.

- Paraclinical (''178 [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]'')

- '''NFS/CRP''': '''inflammatory syndrome'' ('''186. [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]'''; '''203. [[Elevated c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203|Elevated C-reactive protein]] (CRP)''') with hyperleukocytosis ('''216. [[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|Leukocyte abnormality]]'''[[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|)]] without necessarily pointing to infectious mastitis.

- '''Bacteriological milk sample''' '''Germ count > 10<sup>6</sup>/mL''' in favour of '''mastitis''' '''infectious''' due to the micro-organism isolated. Most frequent germ: ''staphylococcus aureus''; less frequently: E. coli and, rarely, streptococcus B (consider this in cases of bilateral mastitis).

- Breast ultrasound in the case of an ''atypical'' or ''dragging'' situation to rule out the diagnosis of a breast abscess


'''Breast abscess'''

Definition: well-defined collection of pus in the breast.

Diagnosis :

- The clinic

- The onset is often "insidious" with "chronic pain" and the picture evolves slowly;

- Clinical picture often severe, with '''redness''' ('''85. [[Erythema SD-085|Erythema]]'''), '''pain''' ('''73. [[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]'''), '''heat''' and '''oedema''' ('''9. [[Parietal mass/tumefaction SD-009|Parietal mass/tumefaction]]''').

- '''Fever more moderate''' than in mastitis ('''44. [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Hyperthermia/fever]]''') or even absent.

- On clinical examination (≠ mastitis) ('''164. [[Breast clinical examination abnormality SD-164|Breast clinical examination abnormality]]'''): '''fluctuating mass''' ('''9. [[Parietal mass/tumefaction SD-009|Parietal mass/tumefaction]]''') with change in skin colour to a ''purplish red'' ('''85. [[Erythema SD-085|Erythema]]''') ± skin necrosis;

- Paraclinical (''178 [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]'')

- '''NFS/CRP''': '''inflammatory syndrome'' ('''186. [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]'''; '''203. [[Elevated c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203|Elevated C-reactive protein]] (CRP)''') with hyperleukocytosis ('''216. [[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|Leukocyte abnormality]]''') ;

- Mammary ultrasound in case of doubt: the most specific examination.
