Practical advice on breastfeeding (''273. [[Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding SD-273|Management of normal and difficult breastfeeding]]''') are as follows:

- Immediate breastfeeding;

- Flexible breastfeeding: free hours on request

- A "comfortable" "installation" during feeds: the newborn's mouth must take "a large part of the areola" and not just the nipple, you must "give both breasts at each feed";

- A ''healthy lifestyle'' which includes: plenty to drink, a varied diet rich in protein and calcium, the ''ban on smoking'' ('''314. [Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314|Prevention of tobacco-related risks]]''), alcohol ('''313. [Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313|Prevention of alcohol-related risks]''') and stimulants (coffee, tea), daily washing of the breasts with soap and water, protection of the nipples with a dry compress to prevent maceration.

- Ideally, breastfeeding should last 4 to 6 months.
