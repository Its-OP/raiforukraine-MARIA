- The decision is generally based on guidelines. Ex. HAS. They are used to guide the decision in situations where there is a high prevalence of treatment, a particularly high cost or a high risk of accident.

- Graduation of levels of evidence and corresponding grades of recommendations. E.g. WHO and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, etc.

- These levels of evidence will be used to generate "clinical practice recommendations (CPR)", published in France most often by the HAS.

- Recommendations can be ''analysed'' (relevance, internal and external validity, consideration of bias), using tools such as the AGREE grid.
