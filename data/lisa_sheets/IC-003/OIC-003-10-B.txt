- A decision must aim at ''effectiveness'' = '''achieving its objectives'''''''efficacité'' = '''parvenir à ses objectifs'''

- So we need to agree on the ''objectives''.

- L''''efficiency'' = '''ability to achieve objectives at the cost of optimal resource consumption.'''

- Tools such as the benefit/risk ratio and the cost/effectiveness ratio, as well as meta-analyses using mathematical modelling, can clarify the debate.

- L''''utilité'' undoubtedly has a moral meaning. Back to the patient: the question of conflicting standards. In a healthcare system that is largely reimbursed (welfare state), the usefulness of a procedure cannot be measured simply by the usefulness "perceived" by the patient.
