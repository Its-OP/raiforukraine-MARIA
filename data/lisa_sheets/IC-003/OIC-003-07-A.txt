There are an increasing number of complementary examinations available, falling into four categories:

1.     Imaging

2.     Biological analysis

3.     Endoscopy

4.     Functional tests

The prescription of a complementary test must be made after considering the information that the result will provide (post-test probability), the associated risks, the cost, and the consequences of the result on diagnostic and therapeutic management or prognostic information.
