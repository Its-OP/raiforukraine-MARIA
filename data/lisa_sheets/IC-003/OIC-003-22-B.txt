- Controversy = public disagreement about knowledge (its veracity, stability or applicability).

- The 'normal' state of research, in contrast to the stabilised state of knowledge

- Regularity of controversy in media societies

- ''Fake news'' throughout history, battles of authority

- Knowing how controversy works :

o Publication and counter-publication

o Debate and contestation

o Various 'arenas' for controversy (journals, congresses, media platforms, courts, parliaments)

o Variable, but relatively stable sociological players (medical researchers, practitioners, patients, industry, public authorities)
