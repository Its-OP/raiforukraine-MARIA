- Symptomatologies sometimes '''typical''' => simple reasoning and well codified response with solidly supported recommendations = '''Archetypal recognition''' ('''pattern recognition''). Situations often ''complex''.

- '''Hypothetico-deductive method''': '''triad of hypotheses, clues, confirmation (or invalidation)'''. '''Attentive listening''', then evocation of '''compatible previous clinical situations. Hypotheses'' to be confirmed or refuted by history-taking and clinical examination. The doctor then constructs a series of ''working hypotheses'' which will be confirmed or refuted by the history and clinical examination.

- '''Intuitive mode''': or analogue ("it's business as usual"), highly operational mode: routines.

- '''Algorithmic''' approach: binary approach (yes/no, presence/absence) explores by exclusion, independently of the context.

- '''Exhaustive'' approach:''' in very complex situations, in the face of doubt. It is very costly in terms of time and energy in very complex situations. Risk of incidentalomas.
