<The liability of a healthcare professional or institution may be sought for two purposes: either to penalise the professional or institution, or to compensate a user who has suffered the consequences of an adverse event associated with healthcare. The penalty may be criminal or disciplinary in nature. Compensation is the responsibility of the person responsible (self-employed) or their employer if they are employed (public or private). It may also be obtained through an amicable procedure before the conciliation and compensation commissions. Compensation for victims is ensured by the obligation for doctors and health establishments (public or private) to take out professional indemnity insurance. As well as providing compensation for victims, this insurance covers salaried doctors when the fault is detachable from the service or when the mission entrusted to them is exceeded.
