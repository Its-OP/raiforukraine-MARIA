The ''pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain'' involves the interaction of various factors: hormonal, psychological, anatomical, neurological, etc. There are various hypotheses involved in the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain:

* The ''ischaemic hypothesis'' secondary to uterine contractions during menstruation and to hyperactivity of the uterus in certain situations. Prostaglandins are thought to be responsible for an increase in the contractility of myometrial smooth muscle cells, causing a painful phenomenon of ischaemia.  

* The ''spasmodic hypothesis'' secondary to a delay in the opening of the cervical canal due to a tone of the cervico-isthmic sphincter that is not coordinated with the cycle and with the fall in progesterone, leading to cervical resistance to the evacuation of menstrual periods. Prostaglandins are also thought to be involved at cervical level, which may hinder the flow of blood.

* The ''congestive hypothesis'' secondary to certain hormonal factors and factors responsible for pelvic stasis (constipation, pelvic muscle weakness, pelvic varicose veins) may explain some chronic pain.

* The ''role of hormonal factors'': the imbalance in the oestrogen-progestogen balance in the 2nd part of the cycle in favour of oestrogen may be responsible for certain chronic pelvic pain with congestion phenomena. Similarly, hyperestrogenism at the time of ovulation or a drop in oestrogen levels before menstruation can explain certain chronic intermenstrual or premenstrual clinical pain symptoms.

* The role of psychological factors is difficult to assess, but not negligible. They must be taken into account in the maintenance of chronic pelvic pain. The pelvic-genital area is a frequent site of somatisation of psychological conflicts in women. A sympathetic ear and attitude on the part of the doctor will help the patient to open up and discuss certain personal issues.


The pathophysiology of acute pelvic pain is less obvious than that of chronic pelvic pain. The pelvis contains numerous organs in close proximity to each other, which have different innervations. There are 3 main efferent pathways:

* the pelvic plexus responsible for sacral or perineal pain. It innervates the vagina, cervix and uterine isthmus, utero-sacral ligaments, cul-de-sac of Douglas, lower ureters, bladder trigone and rectosigmoid.

* the hypogastric plexus, responsible for hypogastric pain. It innervates the uterine body, the proximal third of the fallopian tubes, the broad ligament and the bladder cap.

* the aortic plexus, responsible for pain in the iliac fossa, flanks and lumbar fossa. It innervates the ovaries, the distal portion of the fallopian tubes and the retroligamentous ureters.
