Acute pelvic pain can be of genital or extra-genital origin. Although we are going to focus on pain of gynaecological origin, it is important to rule out non-gynecological causes that may present the same symptoms. In fact, "digestive" aetiologies (appendicitis, sigmoiditis, digestive obstruction) and "urinary" aetiologies (pyelonephritis, renal colic) may be responsible for acute pelvic pain associated with "acute abdominal pain in children and adults|abdominal pain]" and therefore require appropriate and specialised treatment.

Because of their frequency and prognosis, the ''main'' ''diagnostic hypotheses of gynaecological origin'' to be aware of and investigate in the presence of acute pelvic pain are :

- ectopic pregnancy

- torsion of the appendix

- Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis|upper genital infection]]

- haemorrhagic rupture of an ovarian cyst.

Aseptic necrobiosis, a possible complication of a uterine fibroid, as well as spontaneous miscarriage or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a woman who has been treated in the previous month with ovarian stimulation as part of a [[Medical assistance for procreation: main biological, medical and ethical aspects of treatment in MAP]] remain causes of acute pelvic pain that should also be considered depending on the context.
