The main additional biological tests to be carried out in the event of acute abdominal pain are :

* Quantitative measurement of plasma Î²-hCG to rule out pregnancy.
* Blood count to check for :
** ''''' anaemia (SDD 217)''''', signs of serious internal haemorrhage which may be secondary to cyst rupture or EP.
** a ''hyperleukocytosis <u>(SDD 216)</u>'', as part of an infectious syndrome.

* The '''C-Reactive Protein''' (CRP) <u>(SDS 203)</u> assay to look for an '''inflammatory syndrome (SDS 186)''' in the context of a [[Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): gonococcal, chlamydial, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis|high genital infection.]]]

* A ''pre-operative work-up'' (Group, RAI, Rh, TP, TCA, fibrinogen) in case of strong suspicion of ruptured EP or adnexal torsion or severe sepsis on IGH leading to rapid surgical management.

Bacteriological samples will also be taken from the vagina, cervix, uterus or abdomen (during laparoscopy) in cases of suspected acute or chronic upper genital infection.
