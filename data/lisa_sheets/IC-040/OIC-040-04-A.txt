Questioning to explore acute pelvic pain should include :

* Date of onset of pain: recent.
* Pain progression: generally rapid.
* Type of pain: stabbing, twisting, colicky, radiating.
* Date of last menstrual period.
* Gynaecological, obstetrical and surgical history.
* Presence of contraception.
* Look for associated signs: infectious syndrome, nausea, vomiting, functional urinary signs, sympathetic signs of pregnancy, metrorrhagia.
* Look for analgesic positions.
* The presence of risky behaviour (unprotected sex).

A meticulous and rigorous clinical examination is an essential part of the investigation of acute pelvic pain. It is generally more effective and informative than for chronic pelvic pain.

Depending on the aetiology, the findings on questioning and clinical examination will differ and will help to guide or confirm the diagnosis.
