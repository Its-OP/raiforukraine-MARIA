In the vast majority of cases, acute pelvic pain requires emergency surgical management. Whether for ''[[Symptomatic ectopic pregnancy|ectopic pregnancy]]''', ''[[haemorrhagic cyst rupture with haemoperitoneum]]'', ''[[adnexal torsion]]'' or ''[[Sexually transmitted infections (STI): gonococci, chlamydiosis, syphilis, human papillomavirus (HPV), trichomoniasis|complicated upper genital infection with abscess]]'', laparoscopic surgery must be performed urgently to reduce mortality and morbidity and safeguard the prognosis for fertility. 

In certain cases of asymptomatic ectopic pregnancy, medical treatment with an intramuscular injection of methotrexate may be considered, with the patient's full cooperation and regular monitoring until Î²-hCG levels are negative. An uncomplicated upper genital infection (no abscess, no pyosalpinx) will be treated with antibiotic therapy without the need for surgery.
