Pelvic pain" refers to all the painful symptoms, spontaneous or provoked, occurring in the pelvic region. They may be secondary to gynaecological, digestive, urinary or rheumatological disorders. It is important to know how to ''differentiate'' [[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]] between acute and chronic pain, as their aetiologies will be different and, above all, their ''management will be more or less urgent''.

*Acute pelvic pain" is recent pain, lasting less than 1 month for most authors, or less than 3 months for some, often with a sudden or rapid onset. Diagnostic and therapeutic management of acute pelvic pain must be rapid because of its potential severity and impact on vital prognosis or future fertility prognosis.

*Chronic pelvic pain (SDS35) is defined as pain that has been present for more than 6 months. It is frequently accompanied by behavioural or social repercussions. The main causes of chronic pelvic pain are digestive, urinary or gynaecological. Chronic gynaecological pain may or may not be related to the cycle.

Rigorous questioning combined with a meticulous clinical examination, in particular a gynaecological examination, can point to a diagnostic hypothesis which will be confirmed by "targeted and well-chosen paraclinical examinations".
