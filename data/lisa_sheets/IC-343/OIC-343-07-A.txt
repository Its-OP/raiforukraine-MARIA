'''Neurological causes''' (refer to the corresponding items)

- Meningeal haemorrhage.

- Meningitis and meningoencephalitis (bacterial, viral, parasitic [neuromalaria] and prion).

- Intracranial expansive processes (tumours, brain abscesses, haematomas).

- Head trauma (subdural, extradural and intraparenchymal haematomas).

- Cerebral infarcts (located in the brain stem, basal ganglia and large infarcts).

- Generalised epilepsy (post-critical phase or non-convulsive malignant state).

In fact, confusion can occur in the course of any chronic neurological pathology (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease) in the presence of physical stress (see Understanding the main non-neurological causes of mental confusion). The underlying neurological pathology is then more of a risk factor than the cause of the confusion.

'''Non-neurological causes'''

- Toxic causes:

o alcohol (acute drunkenness or withdrawal/delirium tremens) ('''[[Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313|prevention of alcohol-related risks]]''')

o drugs

o medication, particularly psychotropic drugs (beware of hidden psychotropic drugs and anticholinergics), in the event of acute intake or withdrawal

o toxic substances (pesticides, solvents, CO) ('''[[Voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic substance or a potentially toxic drug SDD-340|voluntary or involuntary intake of a toxic substance or a potentially toxic drug]]'''')

- Metabolic causes

o Hydroelectrolytic disorders (hyper/hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, dehydration) '''([[Dyscalcemia SD-200|dyscalcemia]]; [[Dyskalemia SDD-201|dyskalemia]]; [[Dysnatremia SDD-202|dysnatremia]])'''''

o Hypoglycaemia '''([[Hypoglycaemia SDD-209|hypoglycaemia]])''''

o Endocrinopathies: metabolic decompensation of diabetes mellitus, acute adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, acute anteropituitary insufficiency '''([[Thyroid balance analysis SDD-194|thyroid balance analysis]], [[Hyperglycaemia SDD-208|hyperglycaemia]], [[Dysnatraemia SDD-202|dysnatraemia]])''''

o Chronic decompensated or acute renal, hepatic and cardiorespiratory failure '''([[Cholestasis SD-198|cholestasis]], [[Increased creatinine SDD-199|increased creatinine]], [[Elevated transaminases without cholestasis SD-206|elevated transaminases without cholestasis]])''''

o Vitamin deficiencies: thiamine (Gayet-Wernicke) and/or PP (pellagra) as part of chronic alcoholism (and its consequences: Korsakoff syndrome) or undernutrition; B12/folate deficiencies '''([[Amaigrissement SD-017|amaigrissement]]; [[Asthénie SD-021|asthénie]]; [[Dénutrition/malnutrition SDD-030|dénutrition/malnutrition]]; [[Prévention des risques liés à l'alcool SD-313|prévention des risques liés à l'alcool]])''''

- Infectious causes : Any cause of fever (urinary tract infections, lung infections), especially if there is an underlying neurocognitive disorder '''([[Urine dipstick analysis SDD-182|urine dipstick analysis]]; [[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SDD-189|analysis of an ECBU]] ; [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SDD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]; [[Elevation of c-reactive protein (cr) SD-203|elevation of c-reactive protein (CRP)]]; [[Leukocyte abnormality SDD-216|leukocyte abnormality]])''''

- Other causes (faecal impaction, acute urinary retention, pain) (''[[Constipation SDD-001|constipation]]; [[Acute urinary retention SDD-097|acute urinary retention]]; [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]]''')


'''The main risk factors for confusional syndrome are:'''

- neurosensory disorders (abnormal vision; hearing loss/deafness)

- chronic psychiatric pathologies ('''[[Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression) SDD-269|Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a patient suffering from a chronic psychiatric disorder (excluding depression)]]; [[Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a depressive patient SDD-288|Follow-up consultation and basic treatment for a depressive patient]]''')

- consumption of alcohol and psychotropic drugs '''([[Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313|prevention of alcohol-related risks]])''''

- immobilisation (hospitalisation, resuscitation, post-operative recovery phase) (''[[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SDD-276|management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]]''')

- pre-existing chronic pathology (''''[[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-266|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-267|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SDD-279|follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology]] ; [[Follow-up consultation for a geriatric patient SD-295|follow-up consultation for a geriatric patient]]''')

- underlying neurocognitive disorder +++: it is justified to reassess the cognitive status of patients at a distance (6 months) from the confusional episode '''([[Memory disorders/cognitive decline SD-131|memory disorders/cognitive decline]]; [[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]])''''
