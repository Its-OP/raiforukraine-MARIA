Broadly speaking, there are three clinical forms of confusional syndrome:

- the ''confused-conionic form'' in which the patient is agitated, prey to dream-like delirium and vegetative disorders (hypersudation, tachycardia),

- the stuporous form, in which drowsiness and psychomotor slowing are the main features,

- the ''mixed form'' alternating irregularly and unpredictably between the states of the first two forms.
