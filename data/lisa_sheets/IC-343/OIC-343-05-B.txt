The clinical diagnosis of confusion ('''[[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]]''') can be aided by the use of diagnostic tools such as the '''''Confusion Assessment Method'' (CAM) :''''

1. sudden onset and fluctuations of symptoms

o Is there a change in the patient's basic mental state?

o Does this behaviour fluctuate throughout the day?

''2. Inattention''

o Does the patient have difficulty focusing?

o Does he lose his train of thought?

o Are they easily distracted?

''3. Disorganisation of thought''

o Is the patient's speech incoherent and disorganised?

o Is the sequence of ideas illogical/unpredictable?

o Does the patient go from one thing to another?

''4. Impaired alertness''

How would you assess your patient's general condition?

o Alert (if alert, criterion 4 is not retained)

o Vigil?

o Lethargic?

o Stupid?

o Comatose?

Three criteria are required. Criteria 1 & 2 must always be present, in combination with criteria 3 and/or 4.
