Imaging '''is not routinely recommended in confusion ([[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]])''', but a CT scan or (depending on the hypotheses and availability of tests) a cerebral MRI should be requested '''as a matter of urgency at the slightest suspicion'' of an underlying neurological lesion '''([[Request for an imaging test SDD-231|request for an imaging test]])''' :

- In the event of focal signs on neurological examination

- If there is a recent history of head trauma or anticoagulant treatment (subdural or parenchymal haematoma) (see item 108 Confusion, dementia: question Know the imaging semiology of chronic subdural haematoma).

- Before any lumbar puncture in cases of suspected meningoencephalitis (item 151. Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children)

- If confusion has set in suddenly (suspected stroke item 340).
