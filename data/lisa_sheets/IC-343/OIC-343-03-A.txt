The clinical diagnosis of confusional syndrome (''''[[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|mental confusion/disorientation]]''') consists of putting together the elements of the definition (cf item 108 Know the definition of confusion and dementia; item 343 Definition of confusional syndrome) :

- Attention deficit disorder''([[Attention Deficit Disorder SDD-129|attention deficit disorder]])'''' severe associated with moderate impairment of alertness''([[Coma and Consciousness Disorder SDD-028|coma and consciousness disorder]])''''''

- acute or subacute, fluctuating (reversal of nycthemeral rhythm) '''([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SDD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia]])''''

- leading to disorganised thinking ([[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|'''mental confusion/disorientation''']]) and behavioural disorders (agitation; apathy; hallucinations; delusions)

The major clinical argument is the ''fluctuation of clinical disorders'' according to the time of day, up to the point of a ''reversal of the sleep-wake cycle'' (nycthemeral cycle), with confusion and agitation worsening significantly in the vesper period and in the dark, while a large part of the day is taken up by sleepiness.

'''There may be somatic signs that are not specific to an aetiology''': a '''[[Tremor SDD-128|tremor]]''' myoclonic (irregular jerking) of the extremities, attitude and action, asterixis (or '''flapping tremor''': negative myoclonus by intermittent and repeated drops in muscle tone) '''([[Abnormal movements SDD-126|abnormal movements]])'''.

After resolution, there is ''lacunar amnesia'' of the entire confusional episode.

Clinical diagnosis can be aided by the use of diagnostic tools such as the '''''Confusion Assessment Method'' (CAM):''''

# Sudden onset and fluctuating symptoms

o Is there a change in the patient's basic mental state?

o Does this behaviour fluctuate throughout the day?

2. inattention

o Does the patient have difficulty focusing?

o Does he lose his train of thought?

o Are they easily distracted?

''3. Disorganisation of thought''

o Is the patient's speech incoherent and disorganised?

o Is the sequence of ideas illogical/unpredictable?

o Does the patient go from one thing to another?

''4. Impaired alertness''

How would you assess your patient's general condition?

o Alert (if alert, criterion 4 is not retained)

o Vigil?

o Lethargic?

o Stupid?

o Comatose?

Three criteria are required. Criteria 1 & 2 must always be present, in combination with criteria 3 and/or 4.
