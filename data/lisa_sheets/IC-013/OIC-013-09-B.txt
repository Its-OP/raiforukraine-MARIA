o ''[[Know the definition of a judicial alert and a judicial requisition 2C-012-DE-B02|Judicial alert]]''': legal term: bringing to the attention of the competent authorities serious facts requiring appropriate measures. In the case of a report made by a doctor, the aim is to protect a victim or to prevent a murder or suicide.

Reporting is a legal exception to medical confidentiality. Doctors cannot be prosecuted for reporting a problem, unless it is established that they did not act in good faith (Art. 226-14 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).  Reports must be written objectively and must not implicate third parties by name. Numerous models are available on the Internet to help doctors draw up their reports, in particular on the website of the French Medical Council (Conseil de l'ordre). The report should be sent to the Procureur de la République (public prosecutor), by telephone and then by email as a matter of urgency, with a copy to the Cellule de Recueil des Informations Préoccupantes (CRIP) if it concerns a minor. Contact details are available on the Internet.
