o '''Assault and battery''''

Violence inflicted "intentionally" on a victim. This means that the perpetrator deliberately sought to injure the victim, even if the act was not premeditated. Both physical violence (punches, kicks, etc.) and psychological violence (threats, harassment, etc.) are punished in the same way.


o '''Unintentional assault and battery'''

Violence committed ''unintentionally''. The injury suffered by the victim is the result of the perpetrator's clumsiness or failure to comply with a legal safety obligation.

o '''Total incapacity for work (ITT)'''

This is a legal and criminal term, not a medical one. TIW is calculated in days and corresponds to the "number of days the victim is physically and/or psychologically incapable of performing the ordinary and essential acts of daily life on his own" (dressing, moving around, eating, washing, etc.). The term "ITT" is therefore ill-chosen, since it does not mean total incapacity in the strict sense of the term, and is ultimately unrelated to work. The duration of TIW will most often be different from the duration of time off work and the duration of treatment. TIW enables the magistrate in charge of the criminal investigation to assess the seriousness of the injuries sustained, and will play a role in classifying the offences and referring the case to the appropriate court (Table 1).

The classification of an offence may also be modified, at the magistrate's discretion, in the event of aggravating circumstances<ref>https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1524</ref> (CA), for example: violence against a minor under the age of 15, violence by an ascendant, violence by a spouse, violence with weapons, violence in a group, etc.
