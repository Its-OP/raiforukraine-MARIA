When drawing up an initial medical certificate, each lesion should be described according to an identical plan, taking care to mention: ''type of lesion, colour, size and shape, location (in relation to anatomical landmarks)''.


'''<u>Elemental lesion types</u> :'''

o '''Erythema:''''

Redness, lasting only a few hours, due to vasodilatation of superficial vessels without subcutaneous haemorrhagic suffusion.

Mechanism of injury: flat blunt (caused by crushing a blunt object against the skin), e.g. a slap.

o '''Contusions:''''

*Ecchymosis:

Subcutaneous haemorrhagic suffusion, with no neoformed blood cavity. Palpation may reveal soft oedema, but no neoformed cavity.

Mechanism of injury: blunt (the bruise may reproduce the shape of the blunt object), crushing, crushing.

*''Haematoma'' :

Subcutaneous haemorrhagic suffusion, with a neoformed blood cavity. The relief of the neoformed blood cavity is perceptible when the skin is palpated.

Mechanism of injury: blunt, crushing, crushing.


The colouration of contusions is linked to the cycle of haemoglobin degradation by macrophagic cells. There is no absolute rule for the development of this colouration. A bluish, reddish or purplish contusion is more likely to be recent, whereas a yellowish, greenish or brownish contusion is more likely to be old. A contusion should never be dated precisely on the basis of clinical description alone.


o '''Abrasion / erosion / excoriation''' :

Loss of the superficial part of the skin covering. The abrasion may become crusty within a few hours.

Mechanism of injury in the case of fine, linear or arciform abrasion: rubbing or movement of a stinging/sharp/cutting object on the skin.

Mechanism of injury in the case of more extensive abrasion: friction.


o '''Wounds'''

Break in the continuity of the skin covering ("opening" of the skin).

A distinction is made between superficial wounds (reaching the hypodermis) and deep wounds. Care should be taken to examine the edges of these wounds.

*Wounds with clean edges:

Mechanism: prickly, sharp, cutting.

*Wounds with contused edges:

Mechanism: blunt, crushing, tearing.

*Ballistic wounds:

A distinction is usually made between an inlet port and an outlet port.  


o '''Visceral lesions, fractures'' :

These injuries can result from a variety of mechanisms, including blunt trauma (e.g. hepatic fracture) or stabbing (e.g. lung injury following thoracic stabbing). They are most frequently described on the basis of imaging examinations.


o '''Scarring lesions'''

Abrasions, excoriations and various wounds may develop into scarring lesions. These lesions are particularly important to describe in the context of chronic violence ([[Child, adolescent: identifying the basic traumatic lesions in maltreatment|maltreatment for example]]). Scar lesions may be pinkish (beginning of healing), then hyper- or hypo-pigmented, flat or keloid.
