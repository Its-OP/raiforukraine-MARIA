'''I Vestibular "neuritis": isolated vestibular syndrome'''

- acute unilateral idiopathic vestibular deficit (most often presumed to be viral in origin)

- abrupt onset of a purely "isolated" peripheral vestibular syndrome with no auditory or neurological signs other than involvement of the vestibular VIII with no vascular, infectious, traumatic or tumour-related cause found


II Associated vestibular syndromes (vertigo + ....)

*'''Vertigo + neurological signs: Vascular accident of the posterior cranial fossa (vertebral artery, basilar trunk)''''

- acute unilateral vestibular deficit of ischaemic or haemorrhagic origin

- sudden onset of central vestibular syndrome, most often associated with neurological signs (Wallenberg syndrome, cerebellar syndrome) and [[Headache SD-118|Headache]].

- vertigo may be the first or only neurological sign

*'''Vertigo + traumatic context:''' '''translabyrinthine fracture of the rock''''

The diagnosis is made easily by the severe ''post-traumatic'' context, usually TC-PC (traumatic brain injury-loss of consciousness).

Fracture of the labyrinth during a rock fracture causes total deafness and severe dizziness. [Otorrhea SD-154|Otoliquorrhea]], cerebrospinal rhinoliquorrhea, otorrhagia, very easily point to the diagnosis.

*Vertigo + otoscopic abnormality: Labyrinthitis

- Acute cochleovestibular damage

- Causes : Acute infectious labyrinthitis (AOM, infectious outbreak on cholesteatoma, cholestomatous labyrinth fistula)

- Etiological diagnosis is by otoscopy +++.
