'''<u><big>General principles</big></u>''''

*Diagnosis of BPPV = in a patient with a typical history of positional vertigo, no abnormalities on otoneurological examination, no spontaneous nystagmus: search for vertigo with nystagmus triggered by positional manoeuvres.
*Diagnostic stage: each semicircular canal is associated with a manoeuvre that places the canal in a vertical position (sedimentation of otoconia). In the case of BPPV, it triggers vertigo with nystagmus in the plane of the canal tested, which is best seen under videonystagmoscopy.
*For BPPV of the posterior semicircular canal (the most common and easiest to treat): Dix and Hallpike manoeuvre.

'''<big><u>Treatment</u></big>''':

* The ENT specialist or vestibular physiotherapist performs a release manoeuvre corresponding to the incriminated canal.  
* A single manoeuvre is generally sufficient.
* For the posterior canal: Semont manoeuvre (fast) or Epley manoeuvre (slow).
