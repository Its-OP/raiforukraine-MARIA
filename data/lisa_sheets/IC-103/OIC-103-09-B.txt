'''I. Meniere's disease'''

- Cochleovestibular labyrinth disease

- Linked to hydrops (increase in endolymphatic volume)

- Diagnostic triad: vertigo evolving in attacks > 20 minutes, deafness and tinnitus appearing or worsening during the attack.


II. Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)'''

- Benign tumour arising from the Schwann cells of the vestibular nerve, but manifesting itself by auditory signs in the foreground associated with very polymorphous vestibular signs.

- Any cochlear sign (sudden or progressive unilateral deafness, unilateral tinnitus) and/or unilateral vestibular sign (major crisis or chronic instability) requires an injected MRI of the cerebellopontine angle.


III. vestibular migraine

- Migraine equivalent with otological component

- Recurrent vestibular symptoms (lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours), without auditory signs, in the context of migraine headaches, and exclusion of other causes of vestibular symptoms.
