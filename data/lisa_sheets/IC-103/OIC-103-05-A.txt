'''Vestibular syndrome'' is damage to the peripheral or central vestibular system.'''

It is vital to distinguish between central and peripheral damage (so as not to miss a stroke in acute vertigo).


'''<u><big>Semiology of peripheral vestibular syndrome: HARMONIOUS</big></u>''''

'''1. [[Vertigo and vertiginous sensation SD-064|Vertigo]] "true"''''

'''2. Peripheral nystagmus'''

*spontaneous
*Observed under Barthels glasses, Frenzel glasses or micro-camera (VNS)
*Direction of nystagmus: Horizonto-rotatory
*A slow phase of drift towards the affected ear followed by a rapid phase of recall (the most visible) which defines the direction of the nystagmus, right or left.
*Inhibited by ocular fixation
*Does not change direction according to the direction of gaze

'''3. Head Impulse Test positive'''

Vestibulo-ocular reflex deficit with refixation jerk during brief rotations of the head towards the affected side.

'''4. Segmental deviations'''

*They all deviate towards the side of the vestibule with the deficit, and are accentuated when the eyes are closed.
*Static balance: Romberg test, deviation of the index fingers ([[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])
*Dynamic balance: Fukuda stomping, Babinski-Weil blind walking.

'''5. Neurovegetative signs:'''' [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]]/[[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], [[Hypersudation SD-025|sueurs]]....

'''6. Example'''': in a right peripheral vestibular syndrome: vertigo, with harmonious slow deviations in the same direction on the right: left horizonto-rotatory nystagmus (slow phase towards the right, rapid phase of recall towards the left) whatever the direction of gaze, postural deviations towards the right.

Any clinical presentation atypical of this example should raise the possibility of a central vestibular syndrome.

Similarly, in a peripheral vestibular syndrome, vertigo, nystagmus, postural disorders and neurovegetative syndrome are of equal intensity. If this is not the case, central vestibular syndrome should also be considered.

<big><u>''<br />Semiology of central vestibular syndrome: DYSHARMONIEUX''</u></big>

It corresponds to damage to the vestibular centres and central connections.

Vertigo can also be rotatory, with brief dizzying sensations and/or often permanent imbalance.  

1. study of nystagmus

*Not attenuated by ocular fixation.
*Can change direction, depending on the direction of gaze.
*Can be vertical or rotatory.
*Persistent over time.

'''2. Head Impulse Test normal'''

'''3. Segmental deviations'''

           - Segmental and axial deviations are usually absent or occur on the side of the nystagmus, indicating disharmony.

'''4. Disturbed oculomotricity'''

-Vertical eye skew deviation

-Jerky eye movements during eye pursuit

'''5. Neurological signs

-Cerebellar syndrome ([[Balance disorders SD-130|balance disorders]])

-Involvement of other cranial nerves

-Alternating brainstem syndromes


All these "central" characteristics lead to the definition of "dysharmonic syndrome".
