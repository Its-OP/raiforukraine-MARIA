*Nystagmus'' refers to back and forth eye movements.  When it is of vestibular origin, it combines a slow movement followed by a rapid return.

- <u>Slow phase</u>: produced by asymmetry in the activity of the vestibular nuclei: physiological asymmetry during movement, or pathological in the case of damage to the labyrinth or vestibular pathways.

- <u>Rapid phase</u>: return of the eye to its initial position.

*Nystagmus is defined by the ''direction of its rapid jerk''.

*Nystagmus can beat in the horizontal, vertical or torsional plane (plane of the semicircular canals).

*In each case, the ''direction of the fast phase'' can be distinguished: left or right, up or down, clockwise or counter-clockwise.

In the case of global peripheral damage (complete vestibular neuritis, fracture of the rock, etc.): the nystagmus is horizonto-rotatory. The rotatory component is discrete. This is the typical nystagmus of peripheral vestibular damage. Pure nystagmus (pure vertical or pure rotatory) is rarely peripheral.

Generally, ''nystagmus is congruent'': the 2 eyes perform the same movements in the same plane and in the same direction.
