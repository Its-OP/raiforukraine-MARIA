'''I Acute infectious labyrinthitis (complication of a (bacterial) middle ear infection)'''

- Decreased hearing/deafness SD-140|Deafness]] and [[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo]] violent rotations lasting several days.

- Initially, it is a serous labyrinthitis and superinfection is only secondary.

- The benign serous form produces an irritant syndrome that is usually reversible with treatment.

- The purulent form destroys the labyrinth, resulting in total deafness and unilateral vestibular areflexia.

- The starting point may be acute otitis media or cholesteatoma.


II Rock trauma

*Translabyrinthine rock fracture

- [[Hearing loss/deafness SD-140|Cophosis]] (=total deafness) and [[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo]] severe and disabling.

- Central compensation restores the balance within a few weeks.

- The fracture is visible on CT scans of the rock and passes through the otic capsule in a line which is generally axial, opening up the membranous labyrinth anteriorly and/or posteriorly.

*Damage to the inner ear (cochleovestibular) without fracture - this is labyrinthine "concussion".


III Labyrinthine fistulas

*''Post-traumatic'''

- Context: cranial trauma, barotraumatic accident (diving, aeroplane)

- Progressive destruction of the inner ear by leakage of perilymphatic fluid into the middle ear through rupture of the round window or fracture of the stapes plate.

- Symptoms: dizziness triggered by blowing the nose, noise, sneezing or exertion, with progressive hearing loss (sensorineural deafness).

*Labyrinthine fistula complicating cholesteatoma

- Lysis of the labyrinthine bone by the cholesteatoma matrix

- Cochleovestibular symptoms identical to post-traumatic causes but cholesteatoma on otoscopy


ATTENTION , this list includes rather acute vertigo associated with auditory signs (sensorineural deafness), but Meni√®re's disease or vestibular schwannoma, for example, should not be omitted in this context.
