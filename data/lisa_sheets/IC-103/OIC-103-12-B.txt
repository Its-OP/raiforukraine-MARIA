|Description=If associated neurological signs: MRI of brain and IACs; if otological signs: CT of temporal bone + MRI if necessary; if typical peripheral vertigo (e.g. BPPV), no imaging; if atypical, MRI of IACs and posterior fossa.

*High-performance ''rock scanner'' for: temporal bone, tympano-ossicular system, mastoid, facial nerve, bony labyrinth - ''injection-free, high-resolution''.
*MRI for studying soft tissue (membranous labyrinth, internal acoustic meatus, cerebellopontine angles, posterior cranial fossa) - rocks + brain, without and with gadolinium injection and specific sequences (Flair, diffusion) without or with imaging of the supra-aortic trunks.

#<u>In emergency, to rule out a stroke: MRI, if</u> :
##Red flags for cerebellar infarction.
##Dysharmonious vestibular syndrome
##Neurological signs other than vestibular syndrome
##[[Headache SD-118|Headache]] atypical
##VPPB ([[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo]] benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) atypical and persistent
##First atypical acute vertigo in children

2. <u>Persistent vertigo other than typical BPPV</u>: non-emergency MRI (rule out vestibular schwannoma, posterior fossa tumour).

3. <u>Following associated otological signs</u> (tympanic abnormality, [[Decreased hearing/deafness SD-140|conductive deafness]], [[Otorrhea SD-154|otorrhea]]) suggestive of cholesteatoma: CT scan + MRI with diffusion sequences for cholesteatoma, or even labyrinthitis with gadolinium injection.

4. <u>Traumatic context</u>: rock scan (rock fracture, osteomeningeal breach...).
