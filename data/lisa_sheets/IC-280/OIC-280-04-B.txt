The '''diagnostic approach''' aims firstly to confirm the presence of ascites and secondly to identify its mechanism and cause.

It is "based primarily on clinical examination and ascites puncture" (figure opposite).

























Other paraclinical examinations may then be carried out to clarify the cause (Figure 1). The functional signs of ascites vary according to the cause:

Dyspnoea may be present in cases of large ascites or associated pleural effusion.


Questioning should reveal the risk factors for chronic liver disease. A history of solid cancer, haemopathy, heart disease, kidney disease, tuberculosis, abdominal surgery or trauma should be sought.

Other signs of portal hypertension, hepatocellular insufficiency, right heart failure and neoplasia should also be sought.



In the event of abdominal distension, we look for :

- Sloping dullness in the flanks, but with a sensitivity and specificity of only around 70% for the diagnosis of ascites, the presence of which indicates an ascites volume of at least 1500 mL.

In the obese patient, it can be difficult to detect these signs. The differential diagnoses to be evoked are a bladder globe (hypogastric matityÃÅ with a concave downward and non-mobile upper limit) and a large cyst (ovarian, renal or hepatic).

In the event of large ascites, an abdominal hernia may develop. There is a risk of strangulation and rupture of any umbilical hernia.
