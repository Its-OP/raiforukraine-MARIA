*Acute retention of urine should be ruled out in elderly patients hospitalised with [[2C-132|confusional syndrome 132]] of undetermined origin.

*In patients with diabetes or spinal cord injury, acute urine retention may be painless due to bladder hyposensitivity secondary to vegetative neuropathy.

*Autonomic hyper-reflexia may be the only symptom of acute urine retention in patients with spinal cord injury (lesion above T6).

*In sedated patients, acute urine retention may be painless because of [[2C-136|anesthesia 136]] .
