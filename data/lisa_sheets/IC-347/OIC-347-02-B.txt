*Normal micturition requires:
**a voluntarily opening bladder neck
**an un-narrowed urethra
**a bladder that contracts thanks to the detrusor muscle
**a nervous system that allows simultaneous detrusor contraction and sphincter relaxation.

*Acute retention of urine can therefore be caused by :
**mechanical obstruction
**abnormal detrusor contraction
