. Acute hypercalcaemic crisis (corrected calcaemia > 3.5 mmol/L)

*is a therapeutic emergency
*requires symptomatic treatment in the first instance
*followed secondarily by treatment of the cause (discontinuation of treatment, treatment of cancer, endocrine disease, removal of a parathyroid adenoma, remobilisation, etc.).

. Symptomatic treatment of severe hypercalcaemia :

*perfusion of isotonic saline 9â€° (correction of DEC hypercalciuriant effect of volemic expansion).
*anti-resorptive treatment with injectable bisphosphonate (frequent bone involvement).
*dose depends on severity of hypercalcaemia and renal function
*discontinuation of inducing treatments (calcium and vitamin D, thiazides, lithium, digitalis)
*corticosteroids for hypercalcitriolaemia (granulomatosis, lymphoma) or myeloma
*dialysis with a low-calcium dialysis bath if previous treatments are ineffective
