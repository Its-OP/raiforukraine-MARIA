. Total calcium levels include

*a fraction bound to albumin
*an ionised fraction (55%)

. Only the ionised fraction is the regulated form

. Normal total blood calcium levels are between 2.20 and 2.60 mmol/L.

. Normal ionised calcium levels are between 1.15 and 1.30 mmol/L.

. Total calcaemia varies in the same direction as albuminemia (hypocalcaemia in the case of hypoalbuminemia and total hypercalcaemia in the case of hyperalbuminemia).

. In the case of any abnormality in total calcium, it must be confirmed that it is indeed accompanied by a variation in ionised calcium (i.e. an abnormality in calcium metabolism). This can be done by :

*Direct measurement of ionised calcium (Ca++)
*Calculation of corrected total blood calcium: Total blood calcium (mmol/L) + (40-albumin(g/L))x 0.025
