. A positive diagnosis of hypercalcaemia is made when :

*corrected total blood calcium > 2.60 mmol/L and/or
*ionised blood calcium >1.30 mmol/L


. The pathophysiological (mechanistic) diagnosis of hypercalcaemia is based on the values of :

*PHT +++
*Phosphatemia
*Active vitamin D or calcitriol
*25(OH)-vitamin D3
*24-hour calciuria


Hypercalcaemia,

*Low PTH (<10 pg/ml) indicates an extra-parathyroid mechanism (bone in particular).
*A normal or elevated PTH (> 65 pg/ml), associated with hypophosphatemia (Ph < 0.84 mmol/L), indicates primary hyperparathyroidism.

. The diagnostic approach based on the results of the first-line tests (total blood calcium - ionised blood calcium - PTH - 25(OH)-vitamin D - Calcitriol - 24-hour calciuria) is presented in the table in the LiSA sheet Knowing the main causes of hypercalcaemia (diagnostic tree).

. The diagnosis of repercussions includes :

*creatinine levels (impairment of renal function)
*an ECG if hypercalcaemia is detected

. Summary of first-line tests for hypercalcaemia :

*Total blood calcium - Ionised blood calcium - Albumin in order to calculate corrected blood calcium (positive diagnosis of hypercalcaemia).
*Creatininemia (renal repercussions) - ECG (cardiac repercussions)
*PTH - Phosphatemia - Calcitriol - 24h Calciuria (for mechanistic diagnosis)
*Additional examinations for aetiological purposes (as a second-line treatment and once the mechanistic diagnosis has been made).
