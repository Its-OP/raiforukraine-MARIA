. The etiological diagnosis follows the mechanistic diagnosis

. In the case of parathyroid hypercalcaemia with hypercalciuria and hypophosphataemia (Ph < 0.84 mmol/L), the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. This is the most frequent aetiology +++ and is a biological diagnosis +++.

. The main characteristics of primary hyperparathyroidism are as follows :

*Preferential occurrence in women over the age of 40
*Potential complications
**kidney (phosphocalcic lithiasis or nephrocalcinosis)
**bone (bone loss leading to osteoporosis)
*Nature of lesion
adenoma of one of the 4 parathyroid glands +++ **hyperplasia (more than one parathyroid gland)
**hyperplasia (rarer - consider isolated genetic forms or NEM1 or 2a, HRPT2)
**parathyroid carcinoma (exceptional - poorly tolerated - major hypercalcaemia)
*Morpho-functional examinations to aid diagnosis and localization
**Cervical ultrasound and MIBI scintigraphy in 1st intention. Choline PET scan in case of discrepancy or if tests are non-contributory.
**Only useful if surgical treatment is indicated.
**Can help with localisation (if minimally invasive surgical treatment is envisaged).

. Hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure: a progressive complication of hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic hypocalcaemia (known as tertiary hyperparathyroidism rather than primary hyperparathyroidism), most often discovered after transplantation.


. In the case of extra-parathyroid hypercalcaemia (low PTH), a distinction is made between :

*Bone forms (associated with significant hypercalciuria)
**bone metastases (breast lung kidney thyroid testis)
**multiple myeloma or lymphoma
**hyperthyroidism
**vitamin A intoxication (intake of vitamin A or retinoic acid)
**prolonged immobilisation (stroke, complicated pregnancy)

*Digestive forms (associated with hypercalciuria)
**native vitamin D intoxication (Sterogyl Dedrogyl)
**active vitamin D intoxication (Rocaltrol, Un Alfa)
**increased production of calcitriol outside the kidney (granuloma+++)
**sarcoidosis +++
**tuberculosis
**Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
**acromegaly

*Renal forms (normal or low calciuria): thiazide diuretics or related products.

*malignant humoral hypercalcaemia
**paraneoplastic syndrome
**linked to production of a PTH like substance (PTHrp) (small cell carcinoma +++).
**primary hyperparathyroidism but with low PTH and no hypercalcitriolaemia.

*Rarer forms
**calcium intoxication (milk-drinking syndrome)
**rhabdomyolysis corrections

The diagnostic approach based on the results of the first-line tests (Total Ca - Ionised calcium - PTH - Vitamin D - Calcitriol - Calciuria) is presented in the table below [[Fichier:Diagnostic hypercalcémie.jpg|vignette|Principales causes d'hypercalcémie et présentation biologique, par mécanisme]].
