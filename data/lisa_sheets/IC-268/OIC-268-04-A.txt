. The majority of hypercalcaemias are asymptomatic.

. Hypercalcaemia is symptomatic when it is acute and significant

. The signs of acute hypercalcaemia are :

*Digestive: anorexia, nausea, vomiting and rare attacks of acute pancreatitis.
*Neuropsychological: asthenia, cognitive deficits and mood disorders, confusion, hallucinatory or psychotic episodes and coma if hypercalcaemia is severe.
*Renal: polyuro-polydipsic syndrome due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (reduced sensitivity to ADH), extracellular dehydration due to loss of NaCl, sometimes complicated by functional renal failure.
*Cardiological: QT shortening on ECG. If acute hypercalcaemic crisis (ionised calcium > 3.5 mmol/L), rhythm disorders with risk of ventricular tachycardia or severe bradycardia.


. The clinical signs of chronic hypercalcaemia are simply the translation of peripheral calcium deposits: kidney (calcium lithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, more or less complicated by chronic renal failure), valvular and/or coronary deposits.
