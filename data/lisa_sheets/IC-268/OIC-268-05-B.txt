The electrical signs of hypercalcaemia are

shortening of the QT interval +++ * sinus tachycardia
* sinus tachycardia
* repolarisation disorders (ST segment sub-shift)
* ventricular rhythm disorders


Below is an example of an ECG of a patient with hypercalcaemia at 4.6 mmol/L (bone metastases breast cancer).[[File:ECG Hypercalcaemia.jpg|vignette|ECG of a patient with hypercalcaemia at 4.6 mmol/L (bone metastases breast cancer). Note the shortened QT interval of 259 ms and an equally short QTc of 339 ms].
