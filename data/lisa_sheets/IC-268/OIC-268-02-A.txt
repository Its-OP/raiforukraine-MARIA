. Hypercalcaemia is defined as

*a total blood calcium level greater than 2.60 mmol/L
*an ionised blood calcium level greater than 1.30 mmol/L

. Any total hypercalcaemia must be confirmed by measuring ionised calcium and/or calculating corrected total calcium.

. The signs of acute hypercalcaemia are :

*Digestive disorders: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting and rare attacks of acute pancreatitis.
*Neuropsychological: asthenia, cognitive deficits and mood disorders, confusion, hallucinatory or psychotic episodes and coma if hypercalcaemia is severe.
*Renal: polyuro-polydipsic syndrome due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (reduced sensitivity to ADH), extracellular dehydration due to loss of NaCl, sometimes complicated by functional renal failure.
*Cardiological: QT shortening on ECG. If malignant hypercalcaemia, rhythm disorders with risk of ventricular tachycardia or severe bradycardia.
