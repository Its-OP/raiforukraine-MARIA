==Clinical examination==

===General review===

*morphotype assessment: height, weight, body mass index

*Mammary examination to look for '''[[Gynecomastia SD-041|gynecomastia]]''''

===Genital examination===
(unavoidable if there are any indications on questioning and/or abnormal sperm parameters)

o Bilateral and comparative examination of the testicles, epididymides and vas deferens

*assessment of testicular volume
*search for testicular nodule or testicular deformity
*presence and possible dilation of the epididymides
*presence or absence of vas deferens
*search for varicocele in the standing position (at rest and during the Valsalva manoeuvre)
