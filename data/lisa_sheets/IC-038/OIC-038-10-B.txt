|'''Secretory causes'''

(abnormality in the production of spermatozoa by the testicles)



<br />
|'''Testicular origin''''

- Environmental causes (exposure to toxic substances, heat, etc.)

- Genetic causes (Klinefelter's syndrome, microdeletions within the AZF [Azoospermia Factor] locus located on the long arm of the Y chromosome, etc.).

- Acquired testicular pathologies (torsion, testicular cancer, history of cryptorchidism, varicocele).


'''Central origin (Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)''''

- Functional causes (iatrogenic, etc.)

- Tumours of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal region...

- Hyperprolactinemia

- Kallman de Morsier syndrome and other congenital gonadotropic deficiencies

- Haemochromatosis

| '''Excretory causes'''

normal sperm production, but obstruction downstream of the testis
|<Sequelae of genitourinary infection</nowiki>.


- Surgical sequelae


- Bilateral absence of the vas deferens (often secondary to mutations in the CFTR gene (genital involvement in cystic fibrosis))

- Seminal tract tumour (bilateral epididymal cysts, cyst of the prostatic utricle)


- [[Sexual disorders and erectile dysfunction SD-063|Sexological disorders, erectile dysfunction]]

Note: in women, as in men, mixed causes are frequent (e.g. ovulation disorder + tubal obstruction; unilateral agenesis of the right vas deferens + left varicocele).
