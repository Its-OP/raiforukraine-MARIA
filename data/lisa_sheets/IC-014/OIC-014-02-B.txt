The prospect of death becomes starkly apparent as soon as a serious illness is announced, even if this does not rule out any hope of treatment - hence the staggering effect provoked by the revelation of a pathology where the prognosis is vital. Georges Canguilhem, echoing Freud, notes that the prospect of early death arouses both resignation and revolt: "On the one hand, we experience the exhaustion of the forces by which living beings fight against entropy and degradation. On the other hand, mortality as the programmed outcome of "biological life" processes cannot exhaust the meaning of "human existence", whose fundamental dimensions are the project, openness to the future, and inclusion in a network of shared relationships and affects. It is at this existential pole of our living experience that the 'revolt' against death is anchored, insofar as it signifies the end of participation in a world full of meaning and values.

On the part of carers, who are ill-prepared to deal with death in all its many forms, there are mirror-image attitudes: the refusal to accept death may take the form of taking refuge in technology (seeking to avoid the one-to-one discussion by referring the patient to a specialist in a serious pathology or to palliative care services) or in compassionate therapies (implementing yet another line of chemotherapy, which is known to be useless, but which is supposed to demonstrate concern for the patient). These phenomena can be seen as signs of a retreat from clinical practice: we are moving from "exegesis" (of vital suffering and its existential repercussions) to surgical or chemical "exeresis" (of the anatomical support identified as the cause of the disease and possibly of death). The unprecedented increase in life expectancy over the course of the 20th century has had a destabilising counterpart for medicine: there are no longer simply mortals but dying people, defined by the so-called end-of-life period, and ultimately by the length of the agony, which complicates or weakens the medical definition itself (here lies the whole question of determining the precise conditions under which, in France, the law authorises recourse to deep and continuous sedation). This situation creates uncertainty as to what medicine can and should do for patients. As a result, there are often few professionals in direct contact with the near or imminent experience of death in their patients, apart from GPs, palliative care workers and resuscitators.

Dying thus becomes 'work', for the patient, for the relatives and for the carers, with each party looking for points of reference or anchorage in and between different types of awareness of death. To use the typology established by Anselm Strauss and Barney Glaser, these are 'open consciousness', 'closed consciousness', 'mutually feigned consciousness' and 'presumed consciousness':

*Open consciousness" refers to the situation where the medical team and the patient are all aware that the patient is going to die, even if the precise moment of death and the specific conditions of the last moments remain unclear;
*Closed consciousness' refers to the situation where the medical team, and sometimes the family, know that the patient is going to die, but the patient does not;
*In the case of "mutual feigned awareness", both parties know that the patient is dying, but each pretends that the other does not;
*Finally, in the case of "presumed awareness", the patient suspects that he or she is at the end of life, and tries to find clues to confirm or refute this belief.

To conclude, we can say that in our contemporary societies, where we talk less and less about death (the "end of life") and more and more about the "end of life", the relationship between medicine and individuals and death is situated between three main options:

*The desire to postpone death (which entails the risk of unreasonable obstinacy and which is also expressed today in the utopian vision of transhumanist or posthumanist immortality);
*Support for the dying, with the development of palliative care and the ambition to 'pacify' the relationship with death;
*The desire to control the moment or conditions of death (claims in favour of assisted suicide or euthanasia).

Each of these avenues marks the persistence of what is undoubtedly a very ancient desire to combat or even defeat death, or at least to exercise some form of control over it - a desire for which medicine has become an essential instrument. But in its very interventions, in the multiplicity of demands made on it by society, medicine is at least as much a revelation that the meaning of death, resisting all appropriation, never ceases to elude us.
