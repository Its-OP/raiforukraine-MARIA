=== Uterine fibroid ===
This is the most common tumour of the uterus, affecting 20-30% of women over the age of 35. Around 50% of fibroids are asymptomatic and are discovered during a routine gynaecological examination, ultrasound or other pelvic imaging.

=== Organic or functional ovarian cyst ===
In more than 50% of cases, an ovarian cyst is asymptomatic, and is discovered during a clinical examination or an ultrasound scan carried out for another reason. It may be discovered during a complication.


Functional cysts of the ovary are the most common pelvic swelling in women during genital activity. They correspond to follicular cysts or luteinic cysts (of the corpus luteum) which usually regress spontaneously.


Organic cysts are usually benign. Twenty percent of organic ovarian tumours are malignant or borderline, and the risk of cancer increases with age ([[Menopausal follow-up consultation SD-278|Menopausal follow-up consultation]]).
