Pelvic ultrasound by suspubital and endovaginal route looks for criteria of benignity if an ovarian cyst is diagnosed:

- unilocular image ;

- or plurilocular image but with a very thin septum (< 3 mm);

- absence of solid zones (vegetation) ;

- thin wall ;

- regular peripheral vascularisation

- cyst less than 7 cm in size;

- absence of ascites.

If all the criteria for benignity are met, a new ultrasound scan should be performed at 3 months to check that it is not a functional cyst. In this context, there is no indication for ovarian blockade. If the functional cyst has not disappeared after 3 months, it is probably organic and warrants further investigation by pelvic MRI.

If all the criteria for benignity are not met, pelvic MRI should be performed to verify the origin of the pelvic mass and to characterise it.  

The most common benign organic ovarian masses are ovarian endometrioma, dermoid cyst (presence of fat) and serous cystadenoma. Serous cystadenocarcinoma accounts for 90% of primary malignant tumours of the ovary.
