- Haemorrhagic complications ([[Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy) SD-112|Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy)]])

A submucosal fibroid may be responsible for greater haemorrhage (especially in the presence of an intrauterine device), which may lead to hyposidermic microcytic anaemia (Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion). Other topographical forms of fibroids (subserous and interstitial) rarely cause haemorrhagic bleeding.

- Painful complications

Aseptic necrobiosis of a fibroid is the main cause of pain in fibroids. It is secondary to ischaemia of the fibroid and is characterised by :

- Pelvic pain (pelvic pain), which may be very intense, with a fever of 38-39°C;

- Sometimes metrorrhagia of blackish blood;

- On vaginal examination: an enlarged fibroid, painful on palpation;

- Ultrasound: a cocardial image with central hyperechogenicity.

More rarely, there may be torsion of a pedunculated subserous fibroid, or cervical delivery of a pedunculated submucosal fibroid with expulsive colic.

- Mechanical complications

These are compression-type complications:

- bladder (urine retention)

- rectal ("false needs").

- pelvic venous disease, which may lead to thrombosis or oedema of the lower limbs, and more rarely to phlebitis.

- nerve responsible for sciatica, on the back of the thigh, or obturator neuralgia, on the inside of the thigh.

- ureteral: responsible for ureterohydronephrosis, or even renal colic or pyelonephritis.

- Pregnancy complications

There are many complications during pregnancy. They occur at all stages of pregnancy, increasing the risk of hospitalisation, caesarean section and post-partum complications. They are as follows

- Infertility and repeated spontaneous abortions, particularly in cases of submucosal fibroids (difficulty in procreating);

- Necrobiosis, with threat of premature delivery and risk of prematurity;

- Caesarean section interfering with vaginal delivery;

- Dystocic presentation in the case of a large (interstitial) fibroid;

- Dynamic dystocia or delivery haemorrhage due to poor uterine retraction.
