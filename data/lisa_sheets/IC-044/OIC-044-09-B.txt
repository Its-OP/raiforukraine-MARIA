Twist

It occurs mainly in heavy cysts (dermoid, mucinous), or cysts with a very fine pedicle (para-ovary cyst).

The clinical picture is characteristic with acute pelvic pain ([[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]): it is like a thunderclap in a serene sky. The abdomino-pelvic pain starts suddenly from one second to the next and does not subside, becoming worse. It is associated with vomiting and nausea. Often, episodes of subtorsion have preceded the acute accident.

Abdominal examination reveals a picture of generalised abdomino-pelvic defence ([[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|Localised or generalised muscle contraction]]).

The gynaecological examination revealed an extremely painful cul-de-sac. There were no signs of infection, and no signs that might suggest occlusion;

Ultrasound often shows a liquid or heterogeneous latero-uterine image. Doppler may show cessation of vascularisation of the utero-ovarian and lumbo-ovarian pedicles, but this is an inconstant sign.


Intracystic haemorrhage

It often occurs in functional cysts. It is characterised by :

Rapid onset of pelvic pain syndrome

Tenderness in one of the two iliac fossae on clinical examination ([[Localised or generalised muscle contracture SD-029|Localised or generalised muscle contracture]]). One of the cul-de-sacs is filled and painful.

Ultrasound can reveal a cyst with a very fine echogenic content if the examination is carried out soon after the accident, or a heterogeneous cyst if it is carried out later. Associated peritoneal effusion is often observed.


Rupture of the ovarian cyst

It often complicates haemorrhage and/or torsion. The picture is broadly similar to that of haemorrhage. Ultrasound can guide the diagnosis by showing a small peritoneal effusion if it is just the cyst that has ruptured, or a larger effusion if there is an associated haemoperitoneum. The operation can often be avoided if there is progressive improvement without deglobulation; it sometimes requires 24-hour monitoring; in the event of significant haemoperitoneum or deglobulation, laparoscopy confirms the diagnosis and allows treatment to be carried out (Pre-operative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure).


Complicated upper genital infection (ovarian abscess)

It is either secondary to pelviperitonitis of genital origin, or secondary to ultrasound-guided ovarian puncture for treatment of a cyst or oocyte retrieval. It is characterised by hyperthermia, pelvic contractures and hyperleukocytosis.


Pelvic organ compression

Pelvic organ compression (vesical, rectal, venous, ureteral) is rare.


Obstetrical complications

A large cyst embedded in the recto-uterine cul-de-sac (of Douglas) may be responsible for a praevial obstruction hampering descent of the foetal head. In this case, a caesarean section may be required.

An ovarian cyst may be detected at the start of pregnancy; complications are more frequent during pregnancy. There is a specific course of action during pregnancy (abstention up to 16 weeks' gestation to rule out the most frequent functional cysts; in most cases, surveillance but sometimes laparoscopic surgical exploration at the beginning of the 2nd trimester if a large tumour persists, if there is a suspicion of malignancy or if there are symptoms).
