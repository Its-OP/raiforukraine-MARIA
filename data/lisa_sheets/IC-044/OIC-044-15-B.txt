Pelvic organ prolapse ([[Prolapse SD-107|Prolapse]]) is a frequent pathology, the prevalence of which is estimated at between 30 and 50% of women (prolapse of all stages combined) ([[Post-menopausal consultation SD-278|Post-menopausal consultation]]).

However, prevalence is difficult to assess, depending on the studies and diagnostic methods used. Prevalence varies from 2.9 to 11.4% or 31.8 to 97.7% depending on whether a self-administered questionnaire or a clinical examination using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) classification is used.
