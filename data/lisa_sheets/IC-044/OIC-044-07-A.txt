'''Symptoms'''

There is no specific symptomatology for ovarian cysts.

The main warning signs are :

Moderate unilateral pelvic pain, generally of the heaviness type.

Metrorrhagia (pelvic pain) ([[Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy) SD-112|Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy)]]).

Pollakiuria ([[Micturition abnormality SD-023|Micturition abnormality]]) or digestive disorders due to compression.

Depending on the aetiology, certain symptoms may be present, such as dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia in the case of endometrioma ([[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain)]].

But in more than 50% of cases, the ovarian cyst is latent, and is discovered during a clinical examination or an ultrasound scan carried out for another reason.

Ovarian cysts are sometimes discovered during a complication.


'''Physical examination'''

Vaginal touch [[Pelvic mass SD-106|(Pelvic mass]])

Lateral uterine mass independent of the uterus :

This is because it is separated from the cervix by a groove and it does not transmit to the abdominal hand the movements imparted to the cervix by the vaginal fingers and vice versa,

Once again, the vaginal examination reveals its size and characteristics:

Either regular and mobile, pointing to an ovarian cyst or a pedunculated fibroid,

Or irregular and fixed, pointing to ovarian cancer, endometriosis or infection.


Mass of the recto-uterine cul-de-sac

It is :

Either fixed and poorly defined, pointing to ovarian cancer, endometriosis or even digestive cancer.

Either regular, more or less mobile, corresponding to a benign lesion prolapsing into the cul-de-sac


Abdominal palpation

The upper pole of the swelling is sometimes palpated when it is large, to check that the contours are regular.

We are looking for ascites.
