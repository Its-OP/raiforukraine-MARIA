Genital prolapse ([[Prolapse SD-107|Prolapse]]) is a herniation of the pelvic organs through the vagina; it may involve the bladder (cystocele), the uterus (hysteroptosis), the recto-uterine (Douglas) cul-de-sac (elytrocele) and the rectum (rectocele).

The degree of externalization of the prolapse is determined according to 4 stages:

- Stage 1: intravaginal ;

- Stage 2: at the entrance to the vulva ;

- Stage 3: frankly externalized ;

- Stage 4: complete unwinding of the vagina.
