The only specific symptom of genital prolapse is the sensation of a vaginal ball/ball in the vulva. All the other symptoms are much less specific, i.e. they may be associated with the prolapse without being a consequence of it (pelvic heaviness, dysuria, dyschesia, sexual problems, bladder hyperactivity, stress urinary incontinence).

When there is dysuria or dyschesia, women sometimes report the need to perform digital manoeuvres to reintroduce the prolapse into the vagina, in order to urinate or empty the rectum; this is then suggestive that the dyschesia and/or dysuria are caused by the genital prolapse.  

Diagnosis is made by clinical examination (inspection and use of valves to determine the various elements of the prolapse).

It is important to rule out the presence of ascites or a pelvic mass which may cause or aggravate the externalization of a genital prolapse. An abdomino-pelvic ultrasound will therefore frequently be requested to rule out ascites or a uterine or adnexal tumour pathology.
