==== '''Symptoms''' ====

===== - Menorrhagia ([[Abnormal genital bleeding (excluding known pregnancy) SD-112|Annormal genital bleeding (excluding known pregnancy)]]) ([[Menstrual cycle disorders SD-094|Menstrual cycle disorders]]). =====
This is the main revealing sign and the most pathognomonic. The menstrual periods are increased in duration and abundance. This haemorrhage is sometimes directly related to the fibroid if it is submucosal, but is also the result of changes in the uterine cavity, which is enlarged by interstitial myomas altering the contractility of the myometrium. Sometimes endometrial hyperplasia is associated with luteal insufficiency and increases bleeding.

===== - Metrorrhagia ([[Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy) SD-112|Abnormal genital bleeding (outside known pregnancy)]]). =====
They are rarely isolated. Most often they are menometrorrhagia.

===== - Pelvic mass syndrome ([[Pelvic mass SD-106|Pelvic mass]]) ([[Abdominal mass SD-008|Abdominal mass]]) =====
It may result in :

- Pelvic heaviness or signs of compression of neighbouring organs (pollakiuria due to bladder irritability (voiding abnormality) or constipation due to digestive compression).

- The perception by the woman of a pelvic mass which appears progressively and increases without any real pain, or an increase in the volume of the abdomen for some women.

- Sometimes more severe pelvic pain ([[Pelvic pain SD-099|Pelvic pain]]) associated with complications of myomas or associated adenomyosis, or associated vascular disorders.

===== - Dysmenorrhoea ([[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]) =====
This may be due to a fibroid in the cervix or isthmus which is preventing the menstrual flow from draining away.

'''Physical examination'''

===== - Speculum examination =====
Detects and quantifies the abundance of bleeding

== Vaginal touch
Try to feel a mass and locate it in the uterus or not. The touch is bimanual with the abdominal hand to see the mobilisation of the mass.

=== Uterus enlarged overall ===
A generally enlarged uterus most often corresponds to one or more interstitial or subserous fibroids (dimensions to be assessed, regularity of contours or existence of arches which distort its contours). However, it is important to recognise an enlarged, soft, gravid uterus in the context of delayed menstruation. Similarly, patients should not be misled by a bladder globe and should always be examined after urination. The mass is measured in relation to the umbilicus.

=== Latero-uterine mass ===
It is dependent on the uterus:

- This is because it is continuous with the cervix, not separated from it by a groove, and so it transmits to the abdominal hand the movements imparted to the cervix by the vaginal fingers and vice versa.

- A vaginal examination will reveal its approximate size and the regularity of its contours if the patient is thin.

- It most often corresponds to a sessile subserous fibroid with regular contours, but may be due to another pathology adherent to the uterus (ovarian cancer, endometriosis, infectious adhesion block). In this case, the mass is more likely to be irregular.

== Abdominal examination
This enables the upper pole of the swelling to be palpated when it is large, and the regularity of its contours to be determined.
