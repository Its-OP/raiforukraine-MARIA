#'''<u>Know the regulations on health data protection and the legal issues related to digital health</u>''''

'''Personal data''': ''Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to that person's physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity''.

'''Pseudonymisation:'' this involves replacing identifying information with non-identifying or pseudonymous information (a serial number, for example), so that it is no longer possible to link a set of data directly to an individual.

'''Processing of personal data''': any operation on data from its collection to its destruction.

'''Purpose of processing''': main objective of data processing, for example "identification of factors influencing length of stay in intensive care".

'''Data controller''': the natural or legal person who determines the purpose and means of the data processing. For example, the General Manager is responsible for setting up a computerised patient file. The same applies to private practitioners.

'''RGPD''': ''European Regulation of 27 April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (General Data Protection Regulation)''. It sets out the rules to be followed when processing personal data. It applies to all processing of data of European citizens, in a Member State of the European Union or outside the Union, and to all processing of data carried out in a European country.

'''Loi Informatique et libertés du 6 janvier 1978''': this has been amended several times. The latest version of June 2019 takes into account the provisions of the RGPD.

'''CNIL :''' The Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés is an independent authority created in 1978 by the Loi Informatique et Libertés. Since the implementation of the RGPD, the CNIL is the regulator of personal data in France.

A privacy impact assessment (PIA) is a prerequisite for the processing of personal health data.
