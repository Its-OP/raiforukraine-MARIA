==Big data ==
Heterogeneous/complex data, from different sources<ins>,</ins> in increasingly large volumes and with greater speed, which traditional data processing software cannot handle and which is used to solve detection and prediction decision-making problems.


'''The 4 V's of massive data:'''

*Volume: the quantity of data
*Variety: structured, unstructured (text, images), semi-structured data; heterogeneous sources
*Velocity: speed of generation of new data points
*Veracity: data of varying quality (availability, completeness, reliability, relevance)


Challenges

*Data quality
*Large size
*Multiple sources
*Distributed databases
*Individual data protection

<br />

==Artificial intelligence (AI)==
'''Types:'''

*IA strong: self-awareness, complex reasoning
Weak *IA: specific task

'''Approaches:'''

*symbolic AI: knowledge representation, formalisation, expert rules
*Statistical AI: machine learning/statistics

'''Deep learning neural networks:''''

*Composition of artificial neuron units
*Organisation in layers
*Can approximate any function
*Requires significant resources (data, computation)

'''Data processing methods:''''

*Descriptive analysis
**Visualisation
**Descriptive statistics

*Data mining
**Information retrieval
**Information extraction
**Anomaly detection

*Statistical learning
**Supervised
***Classification
***Regression
**Unsupervised
***Segmentation (clustering)
***Similarity

==Applications:==

*'''Individual'''
**Individual follow-up
**Diagnostic assistance
**Risk stratification
**Event prediction
**Decision support
**Assistance and telemedicine

*Collective
**Collective monitoring and surveillance/vigilance (pharmacovigilance, epidemiology)
**Optimisation of care and its delivery
**Research
***Detection of risk factors
***Characterisation of diseases (rare diseases ++)
***Hypothesis generation
***Screening for inclusion in clinical research
***Real-life studies
***Drug development
