'''Gait and balance examination:''''

If possible, it should be carried out without shoes and bare lower limbs, but also without the patient knowing, for example when they enter the consulting room. The examiner must be able to assess :

Locomotion :

- Lower limb movements, step size and speed

- Upper limb movements (e.g. symmetrical swing)

- Posture of the trunk, general gait when walking

- Occurrence of problems in particular circumstances (transfers, turning around, going up and down stairs, walking in tandem or with eyes closed).

Posture:

It can be normal or inclined forwards, backwards or sideways.

Balance:

It is tested with the eyes open and then closed, in bipodal support with the feet together or apart, in monopodal support, during manoeuvres of resistance to retro- or antepulsion.

Neurological examination

It must include a search for a motor deficit, including a study of the osteotendinous and plantar cutaneous reflexes, a search for amyotrophy, a search for a sensory deficit, a cerebellar syndrome, a peripheral or central vestibular syndrome, a Parkinsonian syndrome or movement disorders, vesico-sphincter disorders and cognitive disorders.

'''- The general examination'''

Dermatological examination: looking for scars from trauma or osteoarticular, neurosurgical or vascular surgery, looking for skin trophic disorders.

Osteoarticular examination: looking for pain, mobility limitationś or joint deformities.

Cardiovascular examination: looking for orthostatic arterial hypotension, cardiac rhythm or conduction disorders, arterial disease.

Ophthalmological examination: looking for a drop in visual acuitý.
