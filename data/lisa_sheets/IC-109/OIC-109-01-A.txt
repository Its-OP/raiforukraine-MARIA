- The date of onset of the problems, how they started, the type of main complaint: pain and its relationship to effort, weakness, instability (to be distinguished from vertigo), small steps, stiffness. A third party's opinion is sometimes necessary, as some complaints are better perceived by those around the patient than by the patient (slowing down, loss of arm swing).

- The severity of the disorder must be assessed in everyday life: ''falls or near-falls'', their consequences in terms of morbidity'' (trauma, fractures, hospitalisation) or in terms of independence (unaccompanied outings from home with or without using public transport, accompanied outings, no outings from home).

- Subjects' ability to climb (strength) or descend stairs (balance), their walking perimeter, their independence for activities (housework, cooking) and daily activities (dressing and grooming in particular), the use of a cane, wheelchair or walker, the need for human assistance, etc.

- The full list of medications taken, which should also be known (''the leading risk factor for falls in the elderly'').

- '''Cognitive abilities''' of the subject
