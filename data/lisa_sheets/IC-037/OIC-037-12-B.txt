The risk factors for repeat abortions are :

- young age

- single patient

- unfavourable socio-economic conditions (difficult economic access to contraception, lack of information)

- unsuitable contraception

Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, intrauterine devices and implants could help prevent repeat abortions. Efforts must also be made to detect past or ongoing violence.
