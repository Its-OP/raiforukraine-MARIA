There are a number of factors that can lead to an abortion:

- lack of contraception

- a lack of information on what to do if you forget to take a pill or if you have a condom 'accident'.

- a recent change of method with a failure to comply with the changeover rules

- an unsuitable / ineffective method

It should be borne in mind that 2/3 of women who undergo a termination have contraception. An unwanted pregnancy does not systematically lead to a termination.
