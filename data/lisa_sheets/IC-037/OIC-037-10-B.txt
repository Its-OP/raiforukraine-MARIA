==''Immediate complications'''==

===Pain===
Ibuprofen should be prescribed as the 1st-line treatment. The dose is 400 to 600 mg, to be repeated if necessary, without exceeding 1,200 mg/24 h. Paracetamol + codeine may be an alternative. Paracetamol alone and phloroglucinol are not recommended. The duration of treatment may vary from a few hours to a few days.

For the instrumental method, NSAIDs are recommended to limit intraoperative and postoperative pain. A dose of 600 mg ibuprofen can be administered pre-operatively.

===Failure===
Complete failure is defined by a progressive pregnancy. The risk of complete failure in the case of instrumental abortion is exceptional (1 to 5 â€°). The rate of progressive pregnancy after medical abortion is 1%.

Partial failure is defined as an incomplete abortion. It is more frequent in the case of medical abortion. Two solutions may then be proposed:

- instrumental suction

- misoprostol per os

===Mechanics===
Specific to the instrumental method :

cervical tears in 0.2 to 1% of cases

uterine perforation: 1 to 4 per 1000 operations

===Haemorrhage===
The risk of haemorrhage after an abortion is 1%, with a transfusion risk of 0.1%. This risk is greater in the case of medically induced abortion.

===Infectious infections===
The risk of upper genital infection is around 1% after an instrumental abortion and 0.3% after a medicated abortion. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended only in the case of instrumental abortion. Particular attention should be paid to the clinical inflammatory syndrome after abortion, whatever the technique, so as not to overlook a type A Streptococcus pyogenes infection.

===Deaths===
The risk of death due to abortion is of the same order as that due to spontaneous miscarriage (0.7 per 100,000).

==Secondary complications ==
These are uterine arteriovenous malformations (UAVM). The persistence of ovarian tissue after a medicated or instrumental abortion can lead to a failure to resorb the peritrophoblastic vascularisation and the creation of a UAVM. The treatment for these complications is embolisation by interventional radiology in the event of haemorrhage.

==''Long-term complications'''==
After one or more abortions, there is no increased risk of :

infertility

SCC, except where the interval between the abortion and the subsequent pregnancy is < 3 months

of EP

placental anomalies

premature delivery

an increase in psychiatric disorders

adenomyosis
