The choice of contraception must take into account :

- efficiency

- side effects, contraindications

- constraints on use (lifestyle, family and cultural context)

- of the cost

- the patient's wishes

- failure of the previous contraception

Contraception must be systematically offered to all patients. The choice is made after receiving informed, objective and personalised information.

The methods used after an abortion can be :

- Oral oestroprogestogenic contraception (or patch) and progestin-only contraception to be started on the day misoprostol is taken and on the day of the instrumental abortion.

- the vaginal ring to be started within 5 days of the instrumental abortion and within one week of taking mifepristone

- the implant can be inserted on the day of the instrumental abortion and as soon as the mifepristone is taken

- IUDs can be inserted immediately after instrumental abortion and on the day of the post-medical abortion check-up.

- information on definitive tubal sterilisation may be given depending on the patient's age
