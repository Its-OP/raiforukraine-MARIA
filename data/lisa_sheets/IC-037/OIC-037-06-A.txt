Abortions can be carried out in health establishments or in a family planning centre. They can also be carried out in private practice, but only for medical abortions up to 9 weeks' gestation. Women having an abortion may also consult a gynaecologist, general practitioner or midwife for the first consultation, even if the latter is not attached to a centre performing abortions.
