Two techniques can be used to perform an abortion. The medicinal technique and the instrumental technique (Table). '''[[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent)]]''''


During the medicated technique, metrorrhagia generally occurs within 3 to 4 hours of taking the prostaglandin, but this should not be taken as proof of success. Effectiveness is judged on the basis of complete expulsion without the need for surgery, and also on the rate of progressive pregnancy. Analgesic treatment must be associated.

The instrumental technique can be performed under local, loco-regional or general anaesthetic.
