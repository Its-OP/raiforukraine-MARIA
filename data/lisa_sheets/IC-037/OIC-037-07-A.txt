During this initial consultation, oral and written information is given on the two methods (advantages and disadvantages). The patient is given a guide file and a certificate of medical consultation. The date of the start of pregnancy must be verified or an ultrasound scan must be prescribed. An appointment for the second consultation is also proposed.

The third stage consists of carrying out the abortion.


A follow-up consultation must be carried out between 14 and 21 days after the abortion, whatever the technique used. This is to ensure that there are no complications. The care provider must also ensure that the patient has taken the contraception appropriate to her situation. A psycho-social interview may also be proposed.  This is only compulsory in the case of a "medicinal" abortion. However, a post-operative visit or check-up is strongly recommended, to ensure that there is no active pregnancy in the case of a ''surgical'' abortion and that there are no complications whatever the type of abortion.
