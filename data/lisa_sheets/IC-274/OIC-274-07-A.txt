'''In adults'''

In cases of acute or chronic vomiting, the aetiological diagnosis is guided by the course, associated signs, their occurrence in relation to the meal, the history and physical examination. Vomiting is sometimes only a minor associated sign compared with the other symptoms, for example in the case of a digestive surgical emergency. The aetiological diagnosis is obvious in the majority of cases.

Depending on the context, certain causes should always be considered: pregnancy; overdose or intolerance of drugs (digitalis, opiates, erythromycin, anticancer drugs, theophylline derivatives, etc.); ingestion of a toxic substance (alcohol); exposure to a toxic substance (solvents, paints, cannabinoid syndrome); intracranial hypertension; metabolic causes (acute renal failure, acute adrenal insufficiency, ketoacidosis, hypercalcaemia) ....

''''' Chronic vomiting'''''


There are also many causes, the most common of which are stenosis of the digestive tract and psychiatric causes.

The most common causes of chronic vomiting are listed in Table 2.

'''''Special situations :'''''

Vomiting in pregnancy

In the 1st trimester of pregnancy, vomiting is common (50% of pregnant women) and, in the absence of complications, is considered to be physiological.

Hyperemesis gravidarum" is a pathological and severe form of vomiting in pregnancy. It involves incoercible vomiting that is resistant to symptomatic treatment and may be complicated by dehydration, hydro-electrolytic disorders, acute malnutrition with ketonuria and liver balance disorders (cytolysis and cholestasis, sometimes icteric). Exceptionally, vomiting can lead to B1 deficiency, complicated by Gayet Wernicke encephalopathy.

In the 3rd<sup>trimester</sup>, pre-eclampsia is an emergency situation that may manifest itself as vomiting. Generally speaking, vomiting in the 3rd<sup>trimester</sup> of pregnancy should raise the suspicion of an obstetric or digestive emergency until proven otherwise.

Chemo-induced vomiting

Anticancer drugs have a variable emetogenic effect, in terms of the severity, onset and duration of vomiting. The optimisation of cancer chemotherapy protocols and the development of preventive antiemetic treatments have made it possible to improve the digestive tolerance of anti-cancer drugs.
