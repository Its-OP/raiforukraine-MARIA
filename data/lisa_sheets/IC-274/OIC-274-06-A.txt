Definitions and semiology

Vomiting is a clinical sign corresponding to the active and sudden expulsion through the mouth of some or all of the gastric contents, linked to a mechanism of contractions of the thoraco-abdominal musculature (diaphragm, abdominal and thoracic wall muscles). Vomiting is often preceded and/or associated with nausea, which is a painless, subjective sensation associated with the need or desire to vomit immediately. They are often accompanied by symptoms of activation of the autonomic nervous system (malaise, tachy- or bradycardia, pallor, etc.).

There are many causes, most of which are common and not serious. The prevalence of this symptom is high in the general population: it usually reflects a benign cause that does not require systematic medical treatment (motion sickness, pregnancy, alcoholism, etc.).

Depending on the cause, vomiting may be acute, chronic (lasting > 7 days) or recurrent. The nature and timing of the vomiting during the day can vary, helping to determine the aetiology (bilious, alimentary, faecal, morning fasting, early postprandial or late postprandial ....).

The semiology of some frequent cases of vomiting:

- Fecal vomiting suggesting a low digestive occlusive syndrome (distal small bowel and colon)

- Chronic late postprandial vomiting of partially digested food suggesting gastric stasis: points to acute or chronic upper gastrointestinal obstruction (gastric tumour, ulcerative duodenal stenosis, pancreatic cancer invading the duodenum) or gastroparesis.

- Morning spitting vomiting without nausea associated with headache suggesting intracranial hypertension

'''Differential diagnoses:'''

Regurgitation and merycism (or "rumination") are the two differential diagnoses of vomiting. They correspond to the upwelling of gastric or oesophageal contents into the mouth without any thoracoabdominal muscular effort. Regurgitation is the passive upwelling of food, without the effort of vomiting or nausea, whereas mericism is the voluntary upwelling of food that is swallowed again after being chewed.

'''Clinical examination:'''

- Questioning: mode of onset, use of medication, exposure to toxic substances, associated functional digestive signs (cessation of transit, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, etc.) and extra-digestive signs (dizziness, headaches, etc.).

- Complete physical examination, including neurological examination

- Look for complications: signs of dehydration, malnutrition, haematemesis, melena ....
