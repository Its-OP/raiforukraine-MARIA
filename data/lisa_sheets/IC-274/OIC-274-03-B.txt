'''In adults'''

If there are no signs of complications, no criteria of vulnerability (elderly subjects, presence of co-morbidities, etc.) and/or in a particular anamnestic context (viral gastroenteritis epidemic, food poisoning, acute alcohol intoxication, drug intolerance, pregnancy in the 1st<sup> trimester, etc.), additional tests are not systematically prescribed.


Two objectives:

#'''''Biological impact assessment'''''

This mainly concerns acute forms suspected of complication, particularly in the most vulnerable patients, and chronic vomiting.

In the event of clinical signs of dehydration, weight loss, deterioration in general condition or chronic vomiting, the following should be prescribed:

- A blood ionogram to look for metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia.

- A haemogram to check for haemoconcentration

- Blood creatinine and urine ionogram to check for functional renal failure

- A blood albumin and pre-albumin test to look for biological signs of malnutrition in cases of chronic vomiting or signs of malnutrition

If there is any sign of digestive haemorrhage, a blood count and haemostasis test (PT, APTT, platelets) should be carried out.

#'''''Etiological assessment'''''

No examination is systematic. The prescription of additional examinations in search of a cause will be guided by the context, the history and the clinical examination.

Some typical situations requiring targeted examinations:

- Beta-HCG: to be measured in women of childbearing age presenting with recent vomiting;

- In children with an abdominal complaint: ultrasound is the gold standard for diagnosing hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, small bowel volvulus and acute intestinal intussusception.

- Abdominopelvic CT scan: useful in the event of acute vomiting associated with cessation of transit, suggesting digestive obstruction;
 
- Cerebral scan: for acute vomiting, associated with morning headaches and/or local neurological signs;
 
- Lumbar puncture: to be discussed in the presence of a febrile meningeal syndrome (vomiting, headache, stiff neck, photo/phonophobia, fever) and preceded by a brain scan if there is any doubt about intracranial hypertension;
 
- ECG looking for inferior infarction, typically in diabetic patients;
 
- Determination of blood glucose, urine dipstick, in a diabetic patient, to look for ketoacidosis;
 
- Gastric emptying scintigraphy: to look for gastroparesis in the presence of chronic vomiting in old diabetes, scleroderma, or in the event of accidental vagotomy after abdominal or thoracic surgery;
 
- Oesogastroduodenal endoscopy: a history of postprandial vomiting with deterioration in general condition should prompt a search for gastric neoplasia or a high digestive obstruction;
 
- Corrected or ionised calcium levels: patients with neoplastic bone metastases.
