'''1- Definition'''

- Postnatal endothelial cell proliferation of unknown cause.

- Vascular tumours are common (10% of infants). More common in girls, premature babies and low-birth-weight infants.

2- ''Histoire naturelle'':

- Absent at birth (or preceded by a telangiectatic macule with peripheral halo of vasoconstriction) = notion of a free interval

- Growth phase from a few days to a few weeks of age, lasting 5 to 6 months

- Spontaneous involution phase (lasting 2 to 10 years) beginning with surface whitening

- At the end of the involution phase :

- 50%: complete regression with no after-effects

- 50%: telangiectasia-type sequelae or fibro-adipal nodule (Figure 113.1 ), sometimes requiring treatment.
