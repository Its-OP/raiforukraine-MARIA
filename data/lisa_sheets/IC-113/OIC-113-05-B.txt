===1- Positive diagnosis===
- The diagnosis is clinical

- Congenital red macules of the same temperature as normal skin, disappearing with in vitro pressure

- They are always present at birth and change little.

- Various locations

- Usually isolated (not associated with other malformations) except for involvement of the upper part of the hemiface => must be checked for associated ocular and cerebral malformations (Sturge Weber syndrome). Figure 113.7

Figure 113.7

- Increase in surface area as the child grows

- Lasts a lifetime

.

===2- Differential diagnosis===
- ''Physiological angiomatous spots of the newborn'': very common in newborns, paler (pink), localised in the interorbital region (angioma flammeus) (Figure 113.8) the forehead, upper eyelids or occiput, progressing towards paleness (except on the nape of the neck and occiput);

- ''Early stage infantile haemangioma'' (see above);
