- 10% of infantile haemangiomas become complicated (see 6 situations below) and require

o Specialist advice and follow-up

o early treatment (the first-line treatment in these cases is per os propranolol)

<br />

===''1- Ulceration'''===
Ulceration follows partial necrosis of the haemangioma (Figure 113.4). Areas at risk include the buttocks and vulva, the lips and the folds of the neck.

Possible consequences:

- pain, aggravated by micturition in the case of locorectal disease and affecting feeding in the case of perioral disease;

- bleeding

- residual scar

===''2- Orbito-palpebral haemangiomas'''===
Risk of functional amblyopia due to occlusion of the visual field and/or deformation of the cornea (compression)

===''3- Haemangiomas of the tip of the nose, large haemangiomas of the face (Figure 113.5) and of the mammary region in girls'''===
Risk of sequelae scarring

===''4- Subglottic haemangiomas'' ===
- Risk of respiratory distress due to laryngeal compression

- May be isolated or associated with a "bearded" cutaneous haemangioma (located symmetrically in the mandibular, chin, cervical and lower lip regions) => ENT endoscopic exploration necessary if haemangioma located in these regions and specialist advice sought (Figure 113.6).

<br />

=== ''5- Hemangiomatosis miliaris'' ===
- Multiple small disseminated haemangiomas from a few millimetres to 1 cm in diameter

- May be associated with hepatic haemangiomas, which are sometimes large

- Request an abdominal ultrasound and specialist advice

===''6- Segmental haemangiomas associated with malformations'''===
Rare plaque haemangiomas (known as segmental haemangiomas) may be accompanied by malformations which vary according to their location:

- Face and cephalic extremity: malformations of the cerebellum, heart, great vessels, eyes, sternum (PHACES syndrome);

- Perineal and lumbosacral region: anorectal and genitourinary malformations, spinal dysraphy (PELVIS or SACRAL syndrome).

A segmental haemangioma in these areas warrants MRI and multidisciplinary specialist management.
