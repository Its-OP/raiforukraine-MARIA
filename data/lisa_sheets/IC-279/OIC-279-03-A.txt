In the early (compensated) stage, cirrhosis is asymptomatic. Later, complications may arise: ascites, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, digestive haemorrhage; cirrhosis is then said to be decompensated.  Hepatocellular carcinoma is a complication of cirrhosis and may occur before the stage of cirrhosis in certain chronic liver diseases (haemochromatosis, hepatitis B, metabolic steatohepatitis).





Prognostic scores are used in current practice during the progression of cirrhosis: the Child-Pugh score and the MELD score.
The MELD score is a continuous score and the Child-Pugh score is a discontinuous score in 3 classes (see tables in supplementary documents).

The 5 variables used to calculate the Child-Pugh score are encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubinemia, albuminemia and prothrombin rate.

Classification
 
Child-Pugh score A 5-6 (1-year survival: 100%)

Child-Pugh score B 7-9 (1-year survival: 80%)

Child-Pugh C score 10-15 (1-year survival: 45%)


The 3 blood variables used to calculate the MELD score are bilirubinemia, INR and creatinemia.
