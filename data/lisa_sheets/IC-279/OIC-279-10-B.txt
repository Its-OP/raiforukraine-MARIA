The first step in management is to look for one of these triggers and correct it.

In the event of severe unconsciousness, treatment consists essentially of preventing inhalation of gastric contents by inserting a nasogastric tube and placing the patient in a semi-seated position, or even by orotracheal intubation.

Lactulose should be used as a curative treatment for clinical hepatic encephalopathy or as secondary prevention.

Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that can be used if lactulose fails.
