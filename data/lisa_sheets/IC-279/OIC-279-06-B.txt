The clinical examination may be normal in patients with compensated cirrhosis.  In certain situations, there may be clinical, biological and morphological signs suggestive of cirrhosis (see item OIC-279-04-A).

If compensated cirrhosis is suspected, non-invasive methods can be used to support the diagnostic hypothesis:

- abdominal Doppler ultrasound may reveal ultrasound anomalies suggestive of cirrhosis (irregular liver contours and hepatic dysmorphia) and signs of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, porto-caval shunts);

- Pulse elastometry - based on analysis of the propagation speed of a shear wave using an ultrasound probe - is the most effective non-invasive test. It measures the hardness of the liver expressed in kilo Pascals and thus gives a semi-quantitative estimate of the degree of fibrosis, either using a dedicated device (Fibroscan®) or a probe fitted to the most recent ultrasound scanners. The measurement must be taken on an empty stomach for at least 2 hours.

- simple serum fibrosis tests (Fib4) or specialised tests (Fibrotest®, Fibromètre®...) give a semi-quantitative estimate of the degree of fibrosis but are not validated for all causes of chronic liver disease


Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always essential.
It can be used to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis when non-invasive tests have not been able to provide a definitive answer. It may also reveal lesions related to the cause of cirrhosis, thereby contributing to the aetiological assessment.
The biopsy fragment may be obtained from a percutaneous or transjugular biopsy, depending on whether or not ascites and/or haemostasis disorders are present (see OIC-276-06-B).
