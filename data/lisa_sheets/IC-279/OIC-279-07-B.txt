Identifying the cause of cirrhosis is of major importance, as its treatment can alter the natural history of the disease.

The most common causes of cirrhosis and diagnostic arguments are listed in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|Causes of cirrhosis
|Diagnostic evidence
|-
| colspan="2" |'''Common causes'''
|-
|Excessive alcohol consumption
|History of excessive drinking, ASAT/ALAT ratio â‰¥ 2, elevated gamma-GT contrasted with subnormal alkaline phosphatase, alcoholic hepatitis on histology.
|-
|Metabolic pathology
|Overweight, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, histological data
|-
|Chronic hepatitis C
|HCV antibody, HCV RNA by PCR in serum
|-
|Chronic hepatitis B
|HBsAg, HBV DNA by PCR in serum
|-

|-
|Genetic haemochromatosis
|Transferrin saturation coefficient > 45%, homozygous C282Y mutation of the ''HFE'' gene, +/- hyperferritinaemia

|Primary biliary cholangitis
|Terrain (middle-aged woman, associated autoimmune conditions), cholestasis, M2-type anti-mitochondrial AC, +/- histological data
|-
|Primary sclerosing cholangitis
|Background (young man, associated chronic inflammatory bowel disease), cholestasis, diffuse cholangitis on imaging (bili-MRI or retrograde cholangiography),
|-
|Autoimmune hepatitis
|Territory (female, associated autoimmune diseases), marked cytolysis, hypergammaglobulinaemia developed at the expense of IgG, high anti-tissue AC titre, histological data, etc.
|-
|Secondary biliary cirrhosis
|History of prolonged obstruction of the bile ducts
|-
|Chronic hepatitis B-delta
|HBsAg, anti-HDV AC, HDV RNA
|-
|Budd-Chiari syndrome
|Liver vein obstruction on imaging, prothrombotic disease

The blood tests to be systematically carried out as a first-line procedure in the etiological diagnosis of cirrhosis are: hepatitis C and hepatitis B serologies, fasting glycaemia, cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting ferritinaemia and transferrin saturation coefficient, plasma protein electrophoresis.

Second-line treatment: delta serology (VHD) if HBsAg positive, anti-tissue antibodies (anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti-LKM1, anti-mitochondrial antibodies).
