==<small>''General benchmarks''</small>==

*Acknowledging requests as an expression of suffering in the terminal phase, whether the distress is physical, psychological, social, spiritual or existential.

*In-depth, multi-disciplinary analysis of the request, placing it in the context of the patient's experience and history (in terms of both their illness and their life).

*Collective multidisciplinary deliberation is essential to build up an overall analysis of the situation and to ensure, if the indication is accepted, that there is no other alternative.

*Compulsory collegial procedure to discuss the response, favourable or unfavourable, to the patient's request for deep and continuous sedation maintained until death.

==<small>''Clinical landmarks''</small>==

*Cross-referencing the various pieces of information gathered by the different healthcare professionals (reviewing the patient's medical history, gathering what the patient has to say, describing the patient's current behaviour, understanding the patient's psychological state, analysing the relational context and the people around the patient, analysing the attitude of the carers, etc.).

*Use of third parties (mobile palliative care team, psychologist, psychiatrist, disease experts, etc.)

*Seeking alternatives to sedation to relieve the patient (mind-body approaches, adjusting analgesics, symptomatic treatments, psychotropic drugs, discussing the proportionality of treatments, meeting the family and friends, going home, etc.).

*Identify whether the patient's request corresponds to an indication for deep and continuous sedation maintained until death, as provided for by the 2016 law.

*Identify, where appropriate, whether the patient's request falls within the indications and recommendations for sedative practices in terminal situations.

*When the request is made in an uncomfortable life-threatening emergency situation, the aim is to ensure that the patient is in an advanced or terminal phase of their illness (not requiring intensive care), that the prognosis is vital in the short term, that the acute situation is unbearable for the patient and that there is no other way to relieve the situation.

==<small>''Relationship benchmarks''</small>==

*Let the patient know that we are listening to their request and maintain communication (even if this request has an emotional impact on both the doctor and the patient).

*Trying to understand what motivates such a request, the patient's experience and how this request fits into their history, possibly in conjunction with their family and friends.

*Assume a certain timeframe in responding to this request, the time it takes to analyse and assess the situation.

*Inform the patient whether or not it is possible to respond to his or her request, giving reasons for doing so and recording them in the medical record.

*When the request is made in an uncomfortable life-threatening emergency, it is important to check whether the possibility of sedation in this context had been discussed with the patient, and also to ensure that the patient consents to sedation (whether or not this was anticipated). Calmness and reassurance are essential in seeking to soothe the patient, as is information about the implementation of sedation and its consequences (loss of the ability to communicate in particular).

==<small>''Legal benchmarks''</small>==

*Article 3 of Act no. 2016-87 of 2 February 2016 creating new rights for patients and people at the end of life authorises patients to request deep and continuous sedation until death in certain specific situations.

*Article 4 of the same law states that everyone has the right to receive treatment and care aimed at relieving suffering, by analgesic and sedative means to respond to intractable suffering in the advanced or terminal phase, even if this may have the effect of shortening life.

*Article 2 of Law no. 2005-370 of 22 April 2005 on patients' rights and the end of life already provided for the possibility of using sedative practices when the doctor is unable to relieve the suffering of a person in the advanced or terminal phase of a serious and incurable disease.
