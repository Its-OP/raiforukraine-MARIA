== <small>'''Sedation''</small> ==
''" '''Sedation''' is the pursuit, by medicinal means, of a decrease in vigilance that may go as far as loss of consciousness. Its aim is to reduce or eliminate the perception of a situation experienced as unbearable by the patient, when all available means adapted to this situation have been proposed and/or implemented without achieving the expected relief'' (<u>SFAP - page 7 - box 1:</u> http://www.sfap.org/system/files/sedation-phase-terminale.pdf; <u>HAS 2018 - page 6</u>: https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2018-03/app_164_guide_pds_sedation_web.pdf).

It is implemented <u>at the request of the patient</u> suffering from a serious and incurable disease, in certain situations of intense distress, in a proportionate and intermittent manner, or in a profound and continuous manner in the indications defined by the so-called Claeys Leonetti law (2016).

Sedation of a patient <u>in the terminal phase</u> is also sometimes implemented in trying symptomatic clinical situations (haemorrhage, dyspnoea, agitated confusion, intractable pain, intense refractory psychological distress...) or to accompany the cessation of life-support techniques at risk of major and unbearable discomfort (NIV, cardio-respiratory assistance, etc...).

== <small>'''Euthanasia''</small> ==
''Euthanasia'' is an act intended to deliberately end the life of a person suffering from a serious and incurable disease, at his or her request, in order to put an end to a situation he or she deems intolerable. It is characterised by its <u>intentionality</u> (the intention is to end the person's life by a lethal injection) and its <u>causality</u> (the product administered results in the certain and immediate ending of life).
