==<small>''Clinical and relational benchmarks''</small>==

*Adopt an attitude of acceptance and openness to this discussion.
*Do not hide behind the legal framework or misuse it (by brushing aside the request because euthanasia and assisted suicide are prohibited in France, or by proposing deep and continuous sedation as an alternative without in-depth exploration).
*Listening empathetically while providing a structured and containing framework ([[Knowing the concept of clinical empathy 2C-001-DE-A09]]; [[Knowing how to show empathy towards the patient 2C-001-PC-A01]]).
*Assuring the patient that the care relationship will be maintained even in the event of disagreement.
*Provide the patient with the necessary palliative and end-of-life care skills (both technical and communicational).
*Adopting a multidisciplinary approach in order to :
*#To better understand the patient's request in order to be able to formulate responses that are adapted to the needs of the patient and those around them.
*#To distance oneself from one's own emotions and thus retain a capacity for analysis and objectivity.
