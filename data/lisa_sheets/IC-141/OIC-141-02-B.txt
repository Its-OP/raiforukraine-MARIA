==<small>''Medical indications for transient, intermittent or continuous sedative practices in terminal palliative situations''</small>==

===<small>'''Difficult or painful technical procedures or care if analgesics and/or nitrous oxide fail''</small>===

*Painful dressings
*Painful movements when washing...

===<small>''Acute complications with immediate vital risk and/or unbearable for the patient''</small>===

*Cataclysmic acute haemorrhage (from the ENT, pulmonary or digestive tract, etc.)
*Asphyxial respiratory distress (sensation of imminent death from suffocation with panic reaction, acute dyspnoea, etc.)

===<small>''Refractory suffering''</small>===

*Whether all available and appropriate therapeutic and support methods have been proposed and/or implemented:

~ Without obtaining the relief expected by the patient (e.g. continuous dyspnoea)

~ Or they cause unacceptable side effects (e.g. confusion when opioids are increased despite appropriate rotation and adjustment)

~ Or that their therapeutic effects are not likely to take effect within a timeframe acceptable to the patient (e.g. antidepressant with a very short-term prognosis that does not allow sufficient time for action to be effective).

*Deemed unbearable or unacceptable by the patient (sole judge)
*After consultation with the team (to ensure that all alternative therapeutic or medicinal approaches have been considered and thus validate the refractory nature of the treatment).

==<small>''Other complex palliative situations that may give rise to discussion of the indication for sedative practice, after collective multidisciplinary deliberation''</small>==

*<u>Invasive global, moral or existential suffering</u> despite appropriate care and support (with depth and duration of sedation to be adapted according to the patient's situation and prognosis, intermittent transitional sedation sometimes allowing the care plan to be reassessed at a later stage).

*<u>Stopping life-sustaining treatment with a short-term life-threatening risk</u> (ventilation, cardiorespiratory assistance) <u>or medium-term</u> (haemodialysis, enteral nutrition...) with the possibility of deep and continuous sedation beforehand if there is a risk of immediate unbearable discomfort or secondarily depending on the degree of suffering following this cessation and if the patient wishes to maintain communication or if their quality of life remains satisfactory<br />.

==<small>'''Special cases of indications for the right to deep and continuous sedation, maintained until death, associated with analgesia and cessation of life-sustaining treatment (according to the Claeys Leonetti Act of 2 February 2016)'''</small>==

*Some indications are similar to sedative medical practices already recommended before the 2016 law (see above).
*After an "a priori" collegiate procedure to validate the indications.
*<u>At the request of a competent patient</u> capable of expressing themselves and suffering from a <u>grave and incurable condition</u> :

~ With a short-term vital prognosis and presenting refractory suffering

~ Or who requests that suppletive treatment be discontinued, thereby jeopardising their short-term vital prognosis and risking unbearable suffering.

~ In a patient who is incapable of expressing himself</u> and in whom a decision has been made, after a collegial procedure, to limit or stop treatment</u> in order to refuse unreasonable obstinacy (e.g. an elderly patient with a massive cerebral haemorrhage resulting in severe motor and cognitive disability in whom a decision has been made to stop artificial nutrition, sedation being used to relieve any suffering that the professionals do not perceive).
