==<small>''General benchmarks''</small>==

*As far as possible, avoid situations that may justify sedation.

*Multidisciplinary collective decision including the patient's consent or after a multidisciplinary collegial procedure if the patient is unable to express his/her wishes.

*Building an overall analysis of the situation by trying to understand what the patient is going through, in conjunction with the people around him, and by checking that there are no other alternatives.

*Adapting to the specific characteristics of the place of care (health or medico-social establishments, home)

==<small>"Practical guidelines"</small>==

*Cross-referencing the various pieces of information gathered by the different healthcare professionals (reviewing the patient's medical history, gathering what the patient has to say, describing the patient's current behaviour, understanding the patient's psychological state, analysing the relational context and the people around the patient, analysing the attitude of the carers, etc.).

*Use of external third parties (mobile palliative care team, psychologist, psychiatrist, specialist in the disease, etc.).

*Search for alternatives to sedation to relieve the patient (mind-body approaches, adjustment of analgesics, symptomatic treatments, psychotropic drugs, discussion of the proportionality of treatments, meeting with family and friends, return home, etc.).

*If prolonged sedation, discuss whether life-sustaining treatment should be continued.

*If sedation is indicated, information for the patient, family and carers (aim and objective, desired level of reduced alertness, duration, monitoring criteria, consequences of sedation on the body or communication, sense of time and support, etc.) and anticipation of monitoring/clinical reassessment (alertness scales, frequency of monitoring, etc.).

==<small>'''Quality criteria adopted by the Haute Autorité de Santé''</small>==

*Ensure that the team has palliative care skills (trained doctors and carers, availability of a palliative care resource team, skills in handling sedative treatments, etc.).

*Set up a collegiate, multi-professional process (see above)

*Ensure that the objectives of sedation are understood by the team (with traceability).

*Ensure that patients have been given all the information they need, taking into account their ability to understand.
