'''Acute Intoxication''':

- Symptoms:

           * sedation and impaired alertness,

           * ataxia,

           * dysarthria,

           * a life-threatening emergency involving coma with respiratory depression leading to death

           * domestic accidents (falls among the elderly) or road accidents

           * sexual assault as part of chemical submission.           

- The most frequent causes of acute intoxication are benzodiazepines taken in excess of the doses usually prescribed.

- Why is this?

           * to investigate one or more therapeutic effects (anxiolytics, hypnotics, muscle relaxants, etc.)

           * to avoid the progressive loss of effects when treatment is chronic,

           * in cases of deliberate drug intoxication with suicidal intent.
