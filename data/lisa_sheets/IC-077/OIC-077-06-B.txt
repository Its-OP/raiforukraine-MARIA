* Addiction to psychotropic drugs is often the result of inappropriate medical prescriptions.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Benzodiazepines and related drugs have a very marked addictive potential (22 molecules marketed).

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 20% of the French population has been prescribed benzodiazepines or related drugs at least once and

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 60% of these subjects are women.

Prescription is for a limited period, otherwise tolerance is induced and doses escalate. If this behaviour continues, there are cumulative medical and social repercussions, leading to a diagnosis of harmful use, with the development of dependence resulting in an inability to stop or reduce use.

France is Europe's second largest consumer of anxiolytics and hypnotics.
