The aim is to stop taking substances. The main difficulties facing the doctor:

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Withdrawal symptoms as soon as consumption is reduced;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> A high dosage of benzodiazepines causes more severe withdrawal symptoms, failure to stop and resumption of treatment.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The concomitant use of several psychotropic drugs (medicines but also alcohol and other psychoactive substances ...)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The use of benzodiazepines for anxiolytic purposes.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Severe insomnia, poorly treated anxiety disorder, psychological distress.

'''Outpatient weaning:''''

- There is no consensus on how to reduce growth.

- A gradual reduction is the rule and will be adapted to each situation (patient characteristics, starting doses, etc.).

- May last several weeks or months.

- Outpatient: can be carried out by the GP, in a specialist addictionology consultation (e.g. in a CSAPA) or in a day hospital.

- If the patient has significant medical complications or co-morbidities,

           * monitoring is strengthened;

           * multidisciplinary treatment is offered.

At each consultation, you need to :

<nowiki>*</nowiki> identify withdrawal symptoms or new symptoms (reappearance of anxiety symptoms) ;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> assess adherence to the stop protocol;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> to look for an increase in associated consumption (alcohol, tobacco or other psychoactive substances) ;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> titrate the dosage reduction: ask the patient to bring back any unused tablets ;

<nowiki>*</nowiki> to encourage any positive reinforcement from the patient in the event of a regular reduction in dosage.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> to continue medical monitoring during the first few months after stopping.

'''Hospital or institutional weaning:'''

- Suggest scheduled hospitalisation specifically for benzodiazepine withdrawal in the following cases:

           * very high doses of benzodiazepines,

           * rebellious insomnia,

           * dependence on alcohol and other psychoactive substances,

           * severe psychiatric disorders,

           * history of severe withdrawal syndrome and convulsions or failure of ambulatory withdrawal.

- During hospitalisation for another reason: offer the opportunity in agreement with the patient and the attending physician.
