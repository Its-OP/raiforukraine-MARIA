- The ideal goal is to stop taking benzodiazepines altogether;

- Even a reduction in dosage should be considered a favourable result.

- Reducing the dosage is already a step towards stopping consumption.

- If the cessation strategy fails, it is recommended that the patient be encouraged to try again at a later date, once the reasons for the failure have been assessed.

- Intermediate objectives (reduction in frequency of intake and average doses, reduction in hospital admissions for intoxication, disappearance of morning withdrawal signs, etc.) may be set if it is impossible to wean patients off the drug at a given time or if there are repeated failures.

- Control measures can be put in place: single dispensing, dispensing pharmacy, CPAM doctor's contract.

'''Concerning zolpidem:'''

Since 10 April 2017, the prescribing and dispensing of all orally administered zolpidem-based medicines (Stilnox Â® and its generics) have been subject in part to narcotics regulations :

* prescription written on a secure prescription
* the number of units per dose, the number of doses and the dosage must be written out in full
* Overlapping is prohibited, unless expressly stated on the prescription.

Zolpidem remains on List I of poisonous substances and its prescription is still limited to 28 days.
