* Addictions to psychotropic drugs are often the result of inappropriate medical prescriptions.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Benzodiazepines and related drugs have a very marked addictive potential (22 molecules marketed).

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 20% of the French population has been prescribed benzodiazepines or related drugs at least once and

<nowiki>*</nowiki> 60% of these subjects are women.

Prescription is for a limited period, otherwise tolerance is induced and doses escalate. If this behaviour continues, there are cumulative medical and social repercussions, leading to a diagnosis of harmful use, with the development of dependence resulting in an inability to stop or reduce use.

Benzodiazepines and related drugs are among the most widely prescribed psychotropic treatments in France, making our country the second largest consumer of anxiolytics and hypnotics in Europe.
