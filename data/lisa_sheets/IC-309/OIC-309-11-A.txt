The management of a primary lung tumour depends, in order :

*histological type
*tumour extension ("is the tumour resectable? and is there an indication?")"''
*pre-treatment work-up ("is the patient operable?")''

These elements are studied for each patient during a "thoracic oncology multi-disciplinary consultation meeting" (RCP), which leads to a therapeutic proposal adapted to the patient's particular case (called a "personalised care plan" or PPS), which will be explained to the patient before the start of treatment during a "consultation as part of the announcement system".


'''Principles of non-small cell carcinoma treatment:'''

3 situations depending on the extension :

*Cancer localized to the lung (stages I and II) = "local treatment":
**Surgery ± pre- or postoperative systemic treatment
**Radiotherapy if inoperable

*Locally advanced cancer (stage III) = "multi-modal treatment".
**Radiation therapy + systemic treatment
**Surgery + systemic treatment

*Metastatic cancer (stage IV) = "exclusive systemic treatment".


Systemic treatment: chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy or targeted therapy (depending on the presence of a molecular alteration)


The patient's operability assessment includes general condition, comorbidities (particularly cardiovascular), and respiratory function (EFR ± stress test).


'''Principles of small cell carcinoma treatment:'''

2 situations depending on the extension

*Cancer located in the thorax = "local treatment":
**chemotherapy + radiotherapy
*Metastatic cancer = "exclusive systemic treatment".


In all cases, ''supportive care'' begins as soon as the diagnosis is made, and includes in particular :

- nutritional support

- analgesic treatment, both medicinal and non-medicinal (radiotherapy)

- management of other symptoms (dyspnoea)

- psychological support


In all cases, we look for "occupational exposure" at risk, possibly with the help of a specialist in occupational pathology; if there is sufficient exposure, the cancer must be declared an occupational disease.

The management of a secondary lung tumour depends on the origin of the primary tumour.
