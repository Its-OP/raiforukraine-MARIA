'''Incidence:'''

*More than 46,000 new cases/year in France (3rd most common cancer; 2nd most common solid cancer in men and 3rd most common in women).
*2.1 million new cases/year worldwide


'''Mortality:'''

*1<sup>rst</sup> cause of cancer mortality in France: more than 33,000 deaths/year in France (i.e. 20% of cancer deaths),
*1<biggest</biggest> cause of cancer death worldwide: 1.8 million deaths/year.
*5-year survival rate: 17%.
*60-75% of cases are discovered at a locally advanced (stage III) or metastatic (stage IV) stage.


'''Evolution:'''

*Follows the trend in smoking: slight decrease in men, increase in women.


Main risk factor: active and passive smoking, responsible for 85% of cases:

The risk of carcinogenesis increases with the onset and duration of smoking

The risk is linked more to the length of time you smoke than to the quantity smoked

The risk decreases when you stop smoking, but never returns to the level of a non-smoker
