The diagnosis is most often made at a locally advanced or metastatic stage (60 to 75% of cases).

* General signs of cancer: asthenia, anorexia, weight loss.
* Functional respiratory signs: [[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]]; [[Cough SD-167|cough]] persistent; [[haemoptysis]]
* Signs related to locoregional progression:
** Mediastinal organ involvement: superior cava syndrome; dysphagia; dysphonia; phrenic paralysis, etc.
** pleural involvement: pain, pleural effusion
** Thoracic parietal involvement: pain, palpable mass
** Bronchial obstruction: infection, cornage/wheezing
** Pancoast-Tobias syndrome
* Signs related to a metastatic location: neurological signs, bone pain, skin lesion, etc.
* Signs associated with a pro-coagulant state: venous thrombo-embolic disease, etc.
* Signs related to a para-neoplastic syndrome: numerous, including :
** Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone: hyponatremia.
** Cushing's syndrome
** Neurological syndromes: pseudomyasthenia; peripheral neuropathy; limbic encephalitis, etc.
** Hypertrophic pneumonic osteoarthropathy: digital hippocratism, painful oedema of the extremities with sheathing periostitis.
** Isolated digital hippocratism

The disease may be discovered in an asymptomatic patient, incidentally or otherwise, on a thoracic imaging scan for any reason.
