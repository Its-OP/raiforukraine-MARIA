The diagnostic approach includes:

* histological sampling (see question 10), and
* the assessment of loco-regional and distant extension, which enables the disease to be classified according to TNM stages. This has prognostic value and partly determines the treatment strategy. It is based on :
** clinical data
** fibroscopy (endobronchial extension),
** cytological tests (lymph nodes, pleura)
** imaging (see question 7)


'''TNM classification''' (applies to non-small cell carcinomas) :

o the T (tumour) classifies the locoregional extent of the tumour

o the N (node) classifies the lymph node extension of the tumour

o the M (metastasis) classifies the distant extension of the tumour

      



      

       There are 3 stages:

o localised (stages I and II)

o Locally advanced (stage III)

o metastatic (stage IV)
