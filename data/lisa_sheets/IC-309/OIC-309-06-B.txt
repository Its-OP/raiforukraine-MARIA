Small cell carcinoma is :

- a tumour of neuroendocrine origin,

- frequently associated with a para-neoplastic syndrome,

- with a poor prognosis and rapid progression in the absence of treatment,

- an indication for "emergency" chemotherapy, based on a platinum salt-based doublet, combined with immunotherapy if metastatic,

- initially chemosensitive, then progresses unfavourably with relapse(s) and chemoresistance.
