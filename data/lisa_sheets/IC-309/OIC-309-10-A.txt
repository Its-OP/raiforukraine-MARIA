Diagnosis requires ''histological evidence'', which can be obtained from the primary tumour or an easily accessible metastasis.

Depending on its location, the "primary lesion" can be removed by :

- Flexible bronchoscopy, if proximal

- ''Trans-parietal puncture under CT or ultrasound guidance (only if pleural contact)'', if distal

- Surgical removal by thoracoscopy", if it is not accessible by one of the first 2 techniques.


Mediastinal lymph node sampling can be obtained by :

- Transbronchial puncture during echo-endoscopy

- Surgical sampling during mediastinoscopy


The sampling of a ''metastasis'' depends on the metastatic site (skin biopsy, liver biopsy, bone biopsy, lymph node biopsy, etc.).


The histological study of the sample is supplemented by analyses for pre-therapeutic purposes:

- immunohistochemical expression of ''Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1)'', involved in the response to immunotherapy

- the search for molecular alterations involving the EGFR, KRAS, ROS and ALK genes, potentially associated with a response to targeted therapies (tyrosine kinase inhibitors)


An extension work-up should be carried out as soon as the diagnosis of bronchial cancer is confirmed (see questions 5 & 7).
