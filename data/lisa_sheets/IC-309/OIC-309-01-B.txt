Two main histological types:

1- ''non-small cell carcinomas'' (which account for almost 80% of cases), including

*Adenocarcinomas:
**the most common, mostly peripheral in location;
**histology: glandular differentiation; marking for Thyroid Transcription Factor-1 (TTF1) in immunohistochemistry.
*Squamous cell carcinomas:
**rather proximal location ;
**histology: squamous differentiation; marking for p40 in immunohistochemistry.
*Undifferentiated carcinomas


2- small cell carcinomas (15%):

*proximal location with frequent mediastinal invasion
*histology: of neuroendocrine origin, poorly differentiated; immunohistochemistry positive for neuroendocrine markers (CD56; synaptophysin)


'''Metastasis''': a secondary tumour site resulting from the dissemination of tumour cells from the primary tumour via the lymphatic and blood systems, followed by implantation at a distance.
