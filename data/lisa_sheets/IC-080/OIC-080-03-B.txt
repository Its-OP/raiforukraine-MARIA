1. the main substances

* '''Substances prohibited in and out of competition'''
** <u>S0. Unapproved substances</u>
*** Any pharmacological substance not included below and not approved for therapeutic use in humans by a government health authority (e.g. drugs in preclinical or clinical development).
** <u>S1. Anabolic agents (Androgenic anabolic steroids, other anabolic agents)</u>
*** Increase in muscle mass, action on performance and resistance to fatigue.
** <u>S2. Peptide hormones, growth factors and related (Erythropoietin (EPO))</u>
*** Increases erythropoiesis => increases O2 transport => improves endurance
** <u>S3. Beta-2-agonists: Ban on all beta-2 agonists (except salbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol)</u>
*** Improved respiratory function / Increased effort and resistance.
** <u>S4. Hormonal and metabolic modulators (Aromatase inhibitor, oestrogen receptor modulators)</u>
*** Suppression of adverse effects from misuse of anabolic agents / Increase in muscle mass.
** <u>S5. Diuretics and masking agents (Details available on the AFLD website)</u>
*** Weight loss aid / Masking other doping products
* '''Substances prohibited in competition'''
** <u>S6. Stimulants (Amphetamines, cocaine, cathinones, methylphenidate, modafinil, etc.)</u>
*** Reduced fatigue / Improved reaction time / Increased attention and concentration.
** <u>S7. Narcotics (Analgesics derived from opiates: morphine, buprenorphine, methadone, etc.)</u>
*** Pain reduction / Sedative effect / Euphoriant.
** <u>S8. Natural and synthetic cannabinoids (Natural or synthetic Cannabis / Synthetic cannabinoids except CBD)</u>
*** Improved muscle relaxation / Decreased anxiety / Improved sleep.
** <u>S9. Glucocorticoids (All glucocorticoids)</u>
*** Psychostimulant / Increased endurance and pain tolerance
* '''Substances prohibited in certain sports'''
** <u>P1. Beta-blockers (In competition: motoring, billiards, darts, golf, skiing, underwater sports/ In and out of competition: shooting, archery)</u>
*** Anxiety, reduced heart rate and reduced tremor.


'''2. The main methods used for doping purposes'' (prohibited in and out of competition)

* The "manipulation of blood or blood components".
** Both methods are prohibited:
*** Administration or reintroduction of any quantity of blood
*** Artificial enhancement of oxygen consumption, transport or release.
* Chemical and physical manipulations
** Use of substances and procedures that alter doping control samples (catheterisation, substitution, alteration, infusions, injections).
Genetic doping'' ** Use of nucleic acids for doping tests
** Use of nucleic acids to modify genomic sequences
** Use of normal or genetically modified cells
