'''Legislative aspect'''

* France was one of the first countries to legislate on doping.
** Law of 5 April 2006:
*** Repressive aspect: list of prohibited substances and procedures. It is up to each athlete to ensure that any substance they use does not contain a prohibited substance.
*** Preventive measures: introduction of longitudinal medical monitoring.
** Any doctor who detects doping must refuse to issue medical certificates, inform his patient of the risks and offer to refer him to AMPD for treatment. They must inform their patients of their obligation to refer them to the doctor in charge of the AMPD (while respecting medical confidentiality and anonymity). Disciplinary action is taken against doctors who fail to report a case of doping to the AMPD.

* In the event of a positive anti-doping test :
** Sporting sanctions (from suspension from the federation to lifetime disbarment) or even criminal sanctions.
** Penalties may be imposed on friends or carers (if they have facilitated or encouraged the use of doping products).
