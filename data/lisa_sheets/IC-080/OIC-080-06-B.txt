'''Direct measurement: doping controls'''

* Any athlete can be tested, whether professional or amateur.
* They may not refuse to be tested. In the event of refusal => penalty identical to that for doping.
* In-competition and out-of-competition testing
* Implemented by the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD).


'''Indirect measurement: use of athlete's biological passport data'''

* Monitoring of selected biological variables over time, enabling doping to be identified.
* Passport useful for detecting autologous transfusions and EPO (detection of non-physiological changes).
* Includes 2 modules:
** Haematological (blood): screening for methods of improving oxygen transport
** Endocrine (urine): detect endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids not produced by the body.
** 3rd module in progress: growth hormone detection


'''In the event of a positive doping test'''

* Sporting or even criminal sanctions (up to and including family and carers)
