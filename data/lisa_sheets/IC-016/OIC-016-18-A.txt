Access to complementary health insurance is possible:

- In the event that health care costs are covered by the Assurance Maladie (French health insurance scheme) on the basis of professional activity or stable and regular residence in France;

- and ''if resources are below an amount'' which depends on the composition of the household.

Resources are not just the sums shown on the tax notice. They are ''all sums received''. They include :

- income, such as salaries and retirement pensions;

- maintenance payments ;

- financial aid, including allowances and gifts of money ;

- sales of items ;

- gambling winnings, etc.

If you are in receipt of the RSA, the whole household is entitled to the Complémentaire santé solidaire "with no financial contribution".
