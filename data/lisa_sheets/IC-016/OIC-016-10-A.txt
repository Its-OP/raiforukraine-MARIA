At 31 December 2018, France had 3042 healthcare establishments.  These include public healthcare establishments, private healthcare establishments of collective interest (ESPIC) and private for-profit establishments (private commercial clinics)[1].

The trend is :

- a reduction in the number of acute hospital beds,

- the development of outpatient surgery and day hospitalisation in general, as in other rich countries (notably the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom), and

- the development of the medico-social accommodation sector.

In day hospitalisation, we don't talk about hospital beds but about "places".

====Health facilities by type of activity====
Acute establishments provide medical, surgical and obstetric care, while follow-up and rehabilitation establishments provide convalescence care, and long-term care units provide accommodation and care for people whose condition requires constant medical supervision. There are also establishments devoted exclusively to one medical speciality: mental health (psychiatric hospitals) and the fight against cancer (Unicancer, which brings together the twenty cancer centres in France).

====Health facilities by status====
A distinction is made between public and private healthcare establishments. Among private health establishments, there are private not-for-profit establishments known as private health establishments of collective interest (ESPIC) and private commercial establishments (or private commercial clinics).
