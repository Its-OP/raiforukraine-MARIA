The public service commitment contract, created by the HPST law of 21 July 2009, provides that medical students may receive a gross monthly allowance of €1,200 from the second year of medical studies or at any time during the course, including during the internship years. In return, they will have to undertake to work as self-employed or salaried doctors in an area where there is a shortage of doctors, for a period equal to that during which they received the allowance.

Given the time it takes to train a doctor, there is not yet enough time to examine the effectiveness of this measure.

The advantages are as follows:

- A gross monthly allowance of €1,200 paid until the end of medical studies.

- Individualised support throughout the training provided by the regional health agency.

- Support when setting up a business or when taking up a new position with the installation advisor.

The rewards are as follows:

- Respect the duration of the commitment, equal to the period during which the allowance was paid and not less than 2 years.

- Work in a priority intervention zone or a complementary action zone defined by the ARS (see map on the front of the leaflet).

- Choose your place of professional practice from a national list drawn up on the basis of regional medical needs.

- In the case of self-employed or salaried practice and during the period of employment, comply with the agreed tariffs (sector 1)
