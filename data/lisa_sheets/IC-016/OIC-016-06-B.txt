From the early 1990s onwards, the State gradually encouraged the creation of bodies with competence in a specific field: ''health agencies''.

Following the contaminated blood affair in the 1980s and 1990s, the public authorities wanted to separate the assessment of health risks from the decision-making process by creating bodies capable of providing scientific advice to political decision-makers. Specialised agencies were gradually set up with missions relating to :

- health safety (health products, food, work, ionising radiation, environment);

- health monitoring ;

- prevention ;

- blood transfusion ;

- organ transplants.

The activities of these agencies are coordinated within a structured framework, notably through the Comité d'animation du système d'agences (CASA), which regularly brings together their chief executive officers. Other members of the CASA include the French High Council for Public Health (HCSP), the French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and a representative of the chief executives of the regional health agencies (ARS).

The main agencies are :

= Biomedicine Agency =
Created by the 2004 Bioethics Act, the Agence de la biomédecine (ABM) is a government agency. Its remit includes the removal and transplantation of organs, tissues and cells, as well as work in the fields of procreation, embryology and human genetics. It must ensure the rules of health safety, ethics and fairness. It is the reference authority on the medical, scientific and ethical aspects of transplants.

= National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products =
Created by the law of 29 December 2011, the Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament et des produits de santé (ANSM) was set up on 1<sup>er</sup> May 2012. It is responsible for assessing the benefits and risks associated with the use of healthcare products throughout their life cycle. Its remit applies to medicinal products and raw materials, medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, biological products of human origin (labile blood products, organs, tissues, cells, gene and cell therapy products), ancillary therapeutic products, cosmetic products and tattoo products.

French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety = Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail = ANSES
The French National Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health Safety (ANSES) plays a key role in ensuring human health safety in the areas of the environment, work and food.

It also helps to ensure :

- protecting the health and welfare of animals ;

- plant health protection ;

- assessing the nutritional and functional properties of foods.

Lastly, it is responsible for veterinary medicinal products.

= French blood establishment
The Établissement français du sang (EFS) guarantees the safety of the transfusion chain, from donor to recipient. Its primary mission, which is a public service mission, is to ensure France's self-sufficiency in blood products under optimum safety and quality conditions. The EFS covers blood donation, plasma donation and platelet donation. Its role is also to ensure the link between the generosity of donors and the needs of patients.

The EFS manages the following activities:

- collection ;

- preparation ;

- qualification ;

- It is the leading distributor of labile blood products, supplying more than 1,900 health establishments (hospitals and clinics) throughout France.

= Haute autorité de santé =
Created by the law of 13 August 2004, the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) is an independent, consultative body of scientific experts whose mission is to help regulate the healthcare system by improving health quality and efficiency. These are :

- to evaluate the medical usefulness of all procedures, services and health products covered by the health insurance system;

- to implement the "certification of health establishments";

- to "promote good practice and good use of care among healthcare professionals and the general public".

The HAS also designs and provides healthcare professionals with tools, guides and methods to improve patient care.

= National Cancer Institute =
Created by the Public Health Act of 4 August 2004, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) is responsible for coordinating and developing actions to combat cancer in the fields of prevention, screening, care and research.

= Santé publique France =
As a scientific and expert agency in the health field, Santé publique France is responsible for :

- epidemiological observation and monitoring of population health ;

- monitoring health risks threatening populations;

- promoting health and reducing health risks ;

- developing prevention and health education;

- preparing for and responding to health threats, alerts and crises ;

- the launch of the health alert.

===== Advisory bodies and other national structures =====
In addition to the health agencies, a number of national bodies are responsible for health matters:

- the High Council for Public Health (HCSP). Its remit is to :

** to contribute to the preparation, annual monitoring and multi-year assessment of the National Health Strategy;
to provide the public authorities, in conjunction with the health agencies, with the expertise needed to manage health risks and to design and evaluate prevention and health safety policies and strategies; ** to provide the public authorities with forward-looking thinking and advice on public health issues; ** to provide the public authorities with the expertise needed to manage health risks and to design and evaluate prevention and health safety policies and strategies;
** provide public authorities with forward-looking thinking and advice on public health issues;
** contribute to the development of a comprehensive and concerted child health policy.

Recent HCSP reports include the opinion on persistent clinical symptoms following a Covid 19 or Covid 19: preventive measures on bar and restaurant terraces.


o the National Consultative Ethics Committee (CCNE) for life sciences and health

o The role of the National Consultative Ethics Committee for Life Sciences and Health is to issue opinions on the ethical problems and social issues raised by advances in knowledge in the fields of biology, medicine and health. One example is a recent opinion of 7 June 2021 on "Le passe sanitaire: quels enjeux juridiques et éthiques".


- Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (Inserm), the French national institute for health and medical research. Its mission is to improve the health of all by advancing knowledge of living organisms and diseases, innovating treatments and conducting public health research.


- The École des hautes études en santé publique (EHESP) has the following missions:

o provide training for people who have to carry out leadership, management, inspection or control functions in the health, social or medico-social fields;

o provide a network for higher education in public health;

o contribute to public health research activities;

o develop international relations, in particular through exchanges with institutions offering comparable courses.

In short, EHESP trains hospital executives, in particular hospital directors. It also trains medical and pharmaceutical public health inspectors.


o the Haut conseil pour l'avenir de l'assurance maladie (HCAAM), which :

o assesses the health insurance system and its development;

o describes the financial situation and prospects of health insurance schemes and assesses the conditions required to ensure their long-term sustainability;

o ensures the cohesion of the health insurance system in terms of equal access to high-quality care and fair and equitable funding;

o where appropriate, make recommendations or proposals for reform to meet the objectives of social cohesion and the financial sustainability of health insurance schemes.

A report on the regulation of the healthcare system was published in May 2021, taking into account the criticisms levelled at ONDAM and the weaknesses of the French healthcare system, exacerbated by the health crisis caused by Covid 19, in particular the lack of investment in prevention.
