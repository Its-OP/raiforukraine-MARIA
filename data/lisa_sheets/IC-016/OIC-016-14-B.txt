In terms of healthcare provision, the '''<nowiki/>'hospital'''' is by far '''the largest item of healthcare expenditure''', accounting for '''just under half''', followed by '''outpatient''' (ambulatory) medicine, which accounts for '''a quarter''', and '''drugs''', which account for '''a fifth'''. The result is a system that remains highly hospital-centric, a characteristic of European insurance systems.
