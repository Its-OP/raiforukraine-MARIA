The ''departmental (general) councils'' are made up of ''departmental councillors elected for a six-year term'' and have prerogatives relating to prevention and screening, in particular child welfare, including maternal and child protection (PMI), adoption, child protection (taking care of minors in danger), aid for the disabled and care for dependency through the payment of the personalised autonomy allowance[1].


The Maternal and Child Protection (PMI) service was set up in France on 2 November 1945.

The PMI is often located in medical-social centres. It is based on a multidisciplinary approach involving nursery nurses, PMI doctors, midwives, psychologists, early childhood educators and other social service assistants. Care is free of charge for those being monitored.


'''The PMI's missions are as follows:'''

- contraception ;

- family and marriage counselling ;

- screening for sexually transmitted infections ;

- interviews prior to an application for voluntary interruption of pregnancy

- pregnancy monitoring ;

- preparation for birth (healthy lifestyle, breastfeeding, welcoming the baby) ;

- postnatal care ;

- advice on the needs of young children (breast-feeding, nutrition, daily care, sleep, stimulation, play, childcare facilities);

- preventive medical monitoring and vaccinations for children under 6;

- actions to prevent abuse and protect children under the age of 6;

- Health check-ups for 3-4 year olds (vision, hearing, language, adaptation, vaccination status);

- information on social rights and the steps to take;

- approving and monitoring childminders;

- approval and supervision of crèches and day nurseries.
