'''France was characterised by the development of its healthcare system between 1958 and 1984, with the emphasis on curative medicine and hospital construction.''' However, primary health programmes were developed during this period: maternal and child protection, vaccination, the fight against infectious diseases, etc. From 1984, with the first report by the Haut comité de santé publique (now the Haut conseil de la santé publique), the public health perspective began to develop, with ''public health objectives defined for the population''. '''The functions of the French health system''' are to provide '''individual care'' (diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, etc.) as well as '''collective services''' such as disease and disability prevention, health education, health promotion (e.g. education campaigns for a balanced diet). For the period 2018-2022, the ''national health strategy'' provides the framework for health policy and is based on the analysis by the High Council for Public Health (HCSP) of ''the state of health of the population, its main determinants'', as well as possible action strategies to meet the current challenges: health risks linked to the foreseeable increase in exposure to pollutants and toxic substances; risks of exposure of the population to infectious risks; chronic diseases and their consequences; and adapting the healthcare system to demographic, epidemiological and societal challenges<sup><sup>[1]</sup>,[2]</sup>. Four principles of action have been adopted:

* health as an objective in all policies, with particular emphasis on an interministerial approach. The country has an interministerial health committee chaired by the Prime Minister. Concrete actions include the educational health pathway implemented by the Ministry of Education and the mobilisation of the Interministerial Mission for the Fight against Drugs and Addictive Behaviour (Mildeca) in the fight against addictions.     But to develop public health, it is vital that local and regional authorities are involved in developing a population-based approach. The trend towards metropolitanisation of the country in terms of employment and services is causing social inequalities in health (transport times, loss of local employment, housing difficulties, etc.).
* a resolute and active fight against territorial and social inequalities in health, which is the subject of a great deal of descriptive work, but where there are difficulties in proposing actions to promote access to care, even though the social protection system is particularly well developed.
* A territorialised approach to the NHS, with coordination of national, regional and local actions, with a tradition of national steering and local implementation of public health objectives.
* the need to involve users and citizens, with improved access to reliable and accessible information and the dissemination of health democracy initiatives. (For example, the World Health Organisation is proposing tools to help health authorities and healthcare workers communicate about the introduction and administration of COVID-19 vaccines[3]).

Five areas of action have been defined:

*# An ambitious and sustained prevention and health promotion policy, with a lifelong approach, designed not to increase inequalities in health. The concept of proportionate universalism, offering prevention to all, but with different levels for different population groups and adaptation to the specific characteristics of these groups, is recommended so that prevention can reach the population groups that need it most. For example, people in the lowest income brackets smoke twice as often as those in the highest: it is therefore important to promote cessation programmes specifically designed for these groups.
*# Four directions have been recommended for a healthcare system adapted to the issues at stake: 1) a shift towards prevention, in particular by drawing up an inventory of prevention initiatives in the hospital sector, securing the institutional commitment of hospitals, defining a territorial health contract, including health promotion and prevention in each shared medical project, and funding prevention activities developed by health establishments; 2) a shift in the focus of healthcare provision towards outpatient care, improving continuity of care and speeding up the "amblatory shift"; 3) a shift towards quality: patient safety and quality of working life for healthcare professionals; 4) strengthening procedures to deal with emerging health risks.
*# The development of innovation in healthcare, with access to innovation, the digital technological revolution and Big Data in healthcare.
*# development and support for training and research in public health, with the training of healthcare staff to prepare them for changes, the development of research in public health and the strengthening of interactions between researchers and local or national decision-makers.
*# a specific policy focused on the health of children and adolescents, with the promotion of the well-being and health of young people and the educational health pathway in schools, early childhood programmes (such as the programme: the first 1,000 days, where it all begins <nowiki>https://www.1000-premiers-jours.fr/fr</nowiki>), support for maternal and child protection and school health professionals, the introduction of the educational health pathway and improving the participation of young people in health programmes.
