The ''principal role in the administration of the health system in France'' falls to the ''State''. On a national level, it is the Ministry of Health, currently the Ministry of Solidarity and Health, which plays the main role on behalf of the State. In 2021, the Minister for Solidarity and Health will be responsible for preparing and implementing government policy in the areas of solidarity, social cohesion, public health and the organisation of the healthcare system. The Minister for Solidarity and Health prepares and implements government policy in the field of social protection, subject to the powers of the Minister for Action and Public Accounts.


The state intervenes at national level through parliament and government. Parliament passes laws relating to the healthcare system - for example, the Health System Improvement through Trust and Simplification Act 2021. Every year since 1996, parliament has passed a Social Security Financing Act (LFSS), which sets a provisional target for health insurance expenditure for the following year, known as the National Health Insurance Expenditure Target (ONDAM)[1]''''''.

The Minister "prepares and implements government policy relating to the family, children, the elderly and dependency". He is responsible for the organisation of prevention and care; he draws up and implements, in conjunction with the other competent ministers, the rules relating to the policy of protecting health against the various risks likely to affect it; he is also responsible for the medical and paramedical professions and the hospital civil service. It is also responsible for combating drug addiction. Together with the other relevant ministers, it participates in the government's action on research and the promotion of innovation in the field of health. It prepares and monitors the work of the Interministerial Health Committee.

It prepares and implements the "rules relating to the schemes and management of social security bodies" and to supplementary bodies, in respect of old-age insurance, family benefits and sickness and maternity insurance, and, jointly with the Minister for Employment, in respect of accidents at work and occupational illnesses. Together with the Minister for Action and Public Accounts, he is responsible for preparing the Social Security Financing Act and monitoring its implementation.

In conjunction with the Minister for Ecological Transition, it is involved in preparing and implementing policy for the development of the social economy.

It draws up and implements programmes to combat poverty. It participates, in conjunction with the ministers concerned, in the government's action on minimum social benefits, economic and social integration and social innovation.
