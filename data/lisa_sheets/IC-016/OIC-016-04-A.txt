The Regional Health Agencies (ARS) are responsible for steering the healthcare system at regional level[1]. They define and implement health policy in the region, as closely as possible to the needs of the population.

Steering public health policy in the region involves three areas of intervention:

- health monitoring and safety, and health observation;

- defining, financing and evaluating prevention and health promotion initiatives;

- anticipating, preparing for and managing health crises, in liaison with the Prefect.

The aim of regulating healthcare provision in the regions is to respond more effectively to needs and guarantee the efficiency of the healthcare system. It covers the outpatient (primary care), medico-social (assistance and support for the elderly and disabled) and hospital sectors.

In practical terms, the ARS coordinates the activities and allocates the operating budget of hospitals, clinics, care centres and facilities for the elderly, disabled and dependent people.

Regulation has a territorial dimension - to improve the distribution of doctors and healthcare provision across the country - and an economic dimension - to make better use of resources and control healthcare expenditure.

Regulation has been put in place in the various areas of responsibility of the agency, with the law providing the Director General of the ARS with various levers, in particular :

- authorising the creation of care and medico-social establishments and services, monitoring their operation and allocating their resources;

- defining and implementing, with the health insurance bodies and the CNSA (Caisse nationale de solidarité et d'autonomie), actions to prevent and manage health insurance risk in the regions (i.e. balancing income and expenditure);

- assessing and promoting the quality of training for healthcare professionals.

There have been 17 ARS since January 2016. At national level, the work of the ARS is coordinated by the ARS National Steering Committee (CNP). In particular, it is responsible for setting the objectives of the ARS and managing their financial and human resources. It ensures coordination between the central departments of the Ministry of Health, the Union nationale des caisses de l'assurance maladie and the CNSA.

===== Departmental delegations =====
The ARS departmental delegations are responsible for implementing the agency's regional policies at local level, acting as an interface between the regional and local levels, and supporting local players in implementing their projects. They play an important role in local development. There are as many of them as there are departments in each region. They are all organised along the same lines:

- a "Territorial health provision" unit, covering outpatient and hospital care and policies for the disabled and elderly;

- a "Risk Prevention and Management" division, with the monitoring and management of health alerts on the one hand, and health protection and promotion on the other.

===== County councils =====
The general councils are responsible for prevention and screening, in particular maternal and child protection.

==== Municipal level ====
Local authorities have traditionally been involved in health and social matters. The mayor is responsible for enforcing certain public health regulations. There are municipal health and hygiene services whose role is to monitor food hygiene (in particular, the control of drinking water) and housing hygiene (disinfection after contagious diseases, etc.). Finally, the local authority is also responsible for setting up health and medical aid centres.
