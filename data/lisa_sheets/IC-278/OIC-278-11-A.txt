The potential complications of severe hepatocellular insufficiency are :

* Hemodynamic: generalised vasodilatation, arterial hypotension and tachycardia, rhythm disorders;
* Neurological: severe encephalopathy with coma; there is a risk of cerebral oedema in cases of severe acute hepatocellular insufficiency, but not in cases of chronic hepatocellular insufficiency;
* Respiratory: hypoxia, hypocapnia, acute respiratory distress syndrome;
* Renal: acute functional or organic renal failure in acute liver failure, hepatorenal syndrome in cirrhosis;
* Metabolic: hypoglycaemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, hyperlactataemia.
* Infectious (bacterial and/or fungal): in particular pneumopathy and septicaemia.

They warrant early treatment in specialised intensive care or intensive care unit from the stage of severe and/or progressive liver failure.
