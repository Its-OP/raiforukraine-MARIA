Completely benign and very common (5 to 8% of the population).

Transmitted by autosomal recessive mutation of the glucuronyl transferase gene. In clinical practice, it is characterised by moderate and fluctuating unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, never exceeding 80 Âµmol/L. Factors that increase bilirubin levels include fatigue, fasting and infection.

Liver tests are normal (no cytolysis, no cholestasis, no haemolysis)

It is not an illness.
