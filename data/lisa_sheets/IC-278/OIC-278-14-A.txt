'''1 Angiocholitis'''

cf biliary lithiasis item 277 : identifier '''2C-277-DP-A06'''


'''2.    Hepatic insufficiency'''

a. cirrhosis'': the appearance of jaundice in a cirrhotic patient should prompt a search for aggravating factors: exacerbation of viral, autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis, primary cancer, bacterial infection, etc. cf item 279.

b. Acute liver failure": in the case of acute liver failure with jaundice, transaminases are very high (> 20 times the upper limit of normal values). Severe liver failure is diagnosed by a fall in the prothrombin and factor V levels to below 50%, which can progress to severe liver failure (i.e. with encephalopathy) with a spontaneous mortalitý of around 80%. Referral to a liver transplant centre must be organised.
