1. unconjugated bilirubin jaundice

- Normal liver function tests (excluding bilirubin), no anaemia, no history of haemolysis: the diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome is accepted. No follow-up.

- Anaemia or context of haemolysis: work-up to look for haemolysis, LDH, haptoglobinaemia, reticulocytes and specialist haematology opinion.



'''2.    Icterus with mixed bilirubin:''''

- PT, factor V, albumin

- Assessment to look for cirrhosis (item 279) or acute hepatitis (item 167) and their causes


'''3.    Conjugated bilirubin icterus'''

Abdominal ultrasound to look for dilatation of the bile ducts.

ยง '''If the bile ducts are not dilated'''

Search for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) by measuring anti-mitochondria antibodies and for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) by cholangio-MRI.

If no cause is found on cholangio-MRI and anti-mitochondria antibodies are negative: discuss liver puncture and biopsy.


ยง '''If bile ducts dilated on ultrasound or MRI cholangio'''

Identify the site of the obstruction by imaging, depending on the context:

CT scan with injection, bili-MRI/hepatic MRI

Endoscopy: echo-endoscopy, ERCP
