Non-invasive, safe, inexpensive examination, the quality of which varies with the operator and the patient's habitus. Information has variable sensitivity and specificity.

The main objective in the context of jaundice is to look for ''dilatation of the bile ducts'' due to obstruction of the main bile duct and/or convergence of the right and left hepatic ducts.

The other objectives are to look for evidence of lithiasis (vesicular calculi) or a tumour mass in the liver, lymph nodes or pancreas.
