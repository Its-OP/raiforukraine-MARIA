There are many causes of jaundice. A distinction is made between jaundice with unconjugated bilirubin and jaundice with mixed or conjugated bilirubin.

1. unconjugated bilirubin jaundice

The main cause is Gilbert's syndrome. Other causes are hyperhaemolysis and dyserythropoiesis.

'''2.    Icterus with conjugated or mixed bilirubin'''

- Conjugated bilirubin jaundice'' associated with increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase defines cholestatic jaundice.

Cholestasis is defined as a reduction in biliary excretion.

Cholestasis may be due to :

- a pathology of the bile ducts (primary sclerosing cholangitis) or an obstruction of the bile ducts (see below)

- or pathology of the bile ducts: drugs, viruses, genetics.

          



          

- ''Mixed bilirubin jaundice'' combines an increase in both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels without a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase (<2xNl). The most frequent circumstance is severe hepatocellular failure, either as part of cirrhosis or acute hepatitis.
