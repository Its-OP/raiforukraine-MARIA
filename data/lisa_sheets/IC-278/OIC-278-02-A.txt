There are 3 urgent situations to be aware of:

- jaundice with free bilirubin and neurological symptoms = kernicterus = ''hyperbilirubinaemic encephalopathy''.

o Occurs at high levels of free bilirubin (= unconjugated and not bound to albumin), which is neurotoxic. Symptoms in newborns: lethargy, extrapyramidal hypertonia.

o Risk of long-term sequelae: severe encephalopathy, extrapyramidal hypertonia/abnormal movements due to damage to the basal ganglia, deafness, etc.


- jaundice with free bilirubin, with a risk of rapid progression due to haemolysis:

o maternal-fetal incompatibility: essentially in the ABO system (mother O, child A or B) / Rhesus incompatibility rarer since maternal prevention with anti-D human immunoglobulins)

o constitutional haemolysis: G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis (Minkowski-Chauffard disease)

o Risk of rapid progression to neurotoxic levels of free bilirubin / risk of anaemia


- Conjugated bilirubin jaundice due to biliary atresia

o signs of cholestasis: firm hepatomegaly, dark urine, discoloured stools

o treatment: vitamin K supplementation, early surgery
