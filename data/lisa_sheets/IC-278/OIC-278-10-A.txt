'''Icterus associated with severe hepatocellular failure'''

Hyper bilirubinemia is often mixed or predominantly conjugated and is more intense when hepatocellular insufficiency is severe (parameter of Child-Pugh and MELD scores).

The combination of jaundice with hepatic encephalopathy and a drop in prothrombin and factor V levels (<50%) are the criteria for the severity of hepatocellular failure.
