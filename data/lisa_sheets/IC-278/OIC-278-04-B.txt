The aim of treating jaundice is to reduce bilirubinaemia and/or to reduce its increase in order to prevent the risk of neurotoxicity. Total blood bilirubin must be measured before treatment can be initiated.

'''Symptomatic treatment of severe jaundice with free bilirubin'''

It is based on treatment with phototherapy. This is the basic treatment for jaundice caused by free bilirubin. Blue light is used to convert bilirubin into water-soluble breakdown products that can be eliminated by the kidneys. The complications of phototherapy must be prevented: dehydration, hyperthermia, ocular complications (wearing glasses) and gonadal complications (wearing a nappy).

In the case of very severe icterus with free bilirubin, exchange transfusion should be discussed.

Albumin infusion may be indicated in vulnerable newborns or those awaiting exchange transfusion.

Etiological treatment for pathological jaundice

IV polyvalent immunoglobins are recommended in cases of jaundice linked to ABO incompatibility or maternal-foetal alloimmunisation.

Treatment of neonatal infection (particularly E.coli infection).

Surgical treatment for extrahepatic biliary atresia.
