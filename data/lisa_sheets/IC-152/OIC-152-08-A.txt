Blood cultures and cardiac ultrasound are the key tests for diagnosing endocarditis:

- To diagnose a [[Positive blood culture SD-190|bacteremia]] (or fungemia)

- Visualise vegetations or other valvular lesions suggestive of endocarditis (abscesses, valvular destruction).


Blood cultures are the reference test for :

- Isolating the micro-organism responsible

'''- Determine its microbiological origin'''

'''- Guiding the search for the entry point'''


Blood cultures must be taken :

- 3 venous blood samples with culture on aero-anaerobic medium.

- Spaced at least one hour apart, over 24 hours (blood bacterial concentrations fluctuate over time).

- '''Even in the absence of fever/chills'' (bacteremia is not always accompanied by fever).

- With a sufficiently large volume of blood (40 to 60 mL in adults, as this increases the sensitivity of the test).

- And repeated beyond 24 hours in the presence of negative blood cultures, particularly if antibiotics have already been taken.


The microbiology laboratory must be informed if infective endocarditis is suspected.

The [[Infectious diseases:Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis|Duke's criteria]] are frequently used to make the diagnosis of IE, on the basis of microbiological and echocardiographic signs, and other criteria (terrain, clinical and biological signs).
