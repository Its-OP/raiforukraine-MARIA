Embolic lesions complicate IE in 45% of patients. They may involve several organs and be responsible for polymorphous clinical pictures, sometimes noisy and associated with organ dysfunction, or, on the contrary, be completely asymptomatic.

They can manifest as cerebral or peripheral ''ischaemic lesions'' (infarcts), ''abscesses'', or ''infectious aneurysms'' (also known as ''mycotic'' because of their mushroom-like shape), which can be complicated by haemorrhage.

They must be investigated systematically, through clinical examination and additional tests, because their presence can be life-threatening and/or functionally disabling, and so affect the way in which they are managed.

Their location depends on whether the endocarditis is in the right or left heart. The main embolic sites are :

<big>To sum up,</big> while each examination must be carried out in the face of clinical points of appeal, <u>two are carried out fairly systematically in the face of the asymptomatic nature of certain lesions.</u> They allow the main embolic complications during IE of the left heart to be sought:

*MRI of the brain (or CT scan of the brain with injection of contrast medium, if MRI is not available)
*Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan

Embolic localisations are manifested by ''[[Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see item 330)|pulmonary embolisms]]'', often multiple and bilateral, responsible for pulmonary ''[[deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see item 330)|pulmonary embolisms]]'', often multiple and bilateral, responsible for pulmonary ''[[deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (see item 330)|pulmonary embolisms]''' (Figure 8).

A thoracic angioscan is routinely performed to detect these complications.
