The appearance of lesions in the valve endothelium favours colonisation and infection of the valve leaflet during [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|bacteremia]] or [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|fungemia]]. Local bacterial proliferation may lead to the formation of vegetations, abscesses or destruction of the valve. The presence of foreign material (monitoring of valve wearers and vascular prostheses|valvular prostheses, pacemaker leads) also encourages microbial grafting.

There are two factors that favour the occurrence of an AE:

1) '''The presence of a constitutive or acquired lesion of the endocardium.''' There are heart diseases considered to be at high risk (''group A heart diseases,'' table 1) and others at intermediate risk ([[Connaitre les cardiopathies Ã  risque d'EI du groupe B 2C-152-EP-B01|cardiopathies du groupe B]]).

However, in 40% of cases, AR occurs in subjects with apparently healthy hearts. AR is also sometimes indicative of an unrecognised valve anomaly.


2) '''The blood circulation of a [[Know the main infectious agents causing infective endocarditis (bacteria, yeasts) 2C-152-ET-A01|infectious agent]]''' from a ''[[Know the portals of entry according to the infectious agent 2C-152-EP-A01|infectious portal of entry]]''''
