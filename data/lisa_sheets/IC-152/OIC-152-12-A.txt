[For any suspected AE, three tests must be carried out:

'''An [[Electrocardiogram: indications and interpretation|electrocardiogram]] is systematically performed as soon as there is clinical suspicion of an AR''', to detect early any conduction disorder that may reveal a complication (ring abscess...) or signs of ischaemia suggestive of coronary embolisms.  

Other complementary examinations may be carried out:

*If an echocardiogram is inconclusive, the work-up may be completed by a cardiac CT scan or PET scan for a positive diagnosis.
*'''The diagnosis of IE has been confirmed''', other additional examinations are necessary to carry out the '''extension assessment''' '''of the [[Connaitre les principales localisations emboliques en cas d'EI 2C-152-EC-B01|complications emboliques.]]''''
