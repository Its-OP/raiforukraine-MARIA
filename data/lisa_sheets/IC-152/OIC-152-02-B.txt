With an annual incidence of around 35 cases/million inhabitants in France, IE is a "rare" but "serious" infection (hospital mortality close to 20%).

The incidence of AR has not declined in recent years, but the profile of patients has changed, notably as a result of an ageing population, lifestyle changes, a decline in the incidence of post-rheumatic valve disease, and medical advances.

The proportion of AEs linked to high-risk medical procedures (catheters, pacemaker implantation, endovascular procedures, etc.) has risen considerably in recent years, and is now between 25% and 30%.

AR mainly affects ''middle-aged and elderly subjects'' (average age of onset 62 years).
