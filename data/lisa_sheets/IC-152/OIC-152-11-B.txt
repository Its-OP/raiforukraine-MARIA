'''The [http://campus.cerimes.fr/cardiologie-et-maladies-vasculaires/enseignement/cardio_80/site/html/iconographie.html echocardiographic arguments in favour of IE] are:'''

*Presence of vegetation(s) = mobile, hyperechoic, vibratile mass attached to the valve.
*Valvular perforation, cord rupture
*Perivalvular or septal abscess, fistula
*Disinsertion of a valve prosthesis, paraprosthetic leakage

A normal echocardiogram does not rule out the diagnosis. If there is a strong clinical presumption and the initial echocardiogram is negative :

*A positive diagnosis of IE may sometimes be considered and antibiotic treatment continued.
*Echocardiography may be repeated 7 to 10 days later, as abnormalities may be delayed.

<br />The [[Infectious diseases:Duke's criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis|Duke's criteria]] are frequently used to make the diagnosis of IE, on the basis of microbiological, echocardiographic, and other criteria (terrain, clinical and biological signs).[[File:IE - echocardiography - Aortic vegetation with moderate leakage.jpg|left|vignette|'''Figure 1:'''' Trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealing vegetation appended to the aortic valve (A, B), measured at 1.85 cm (C) and responsible for moderate aortic insufficiency on valvular destruction (D) in the setting of Streptococcus bacteremia.]]
