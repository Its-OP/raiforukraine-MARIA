<u>The objectives of antibiotic therapy are:</u>

*In the very short term, to ''control bacteremia in order to treat [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|sepsis]], or prevent its occurrence''.
*Then ''to achieve definitive microbial eradication in the endocardium/vegetation'' (primary site) and in secondary sites.
*And in some cases, to eradicate the portal of entry of the IE.


<u>This bacterial eradication is difficult to achieve:</u>

1- Primary infection site :

*The endocardium is poorly vascularised and the vegetation is avascular.
*The inoculum is very large
*Fibrin protects bacteria from phagocytosis
*Bacteria are slow-growing

2- Secondary locations (e.g. bone, brain, etc.)


<u>For these reasons, the [[Prescribing and monitoring of anti-infective agents in adults and children (see item 330)|antibiotic therapy]] must be:</u>

*Bactericidal
*'''Prolonged'''
*'''In high doses''' (parenteral administration in the initial phase)
*'''Adapted to microbiological results'''
*'''Taking into account all infected sites'''
*'''Begun after blood cultures'''
*'''Sometimes combining synergistic molecules'''
*'''[[Adaptation of treatments to specific conditions such as renal insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, pregnancy, the elderly...) SD-264|And adapted to the patient's condition]]''''

NB: antibiotic therapy may be probabilistic or directly adapted to the results of blood cultures (Cf. [https://www.infectiologie.com/fr/recommandations.html recommendations issued by learned societies for the choice of molecules]. - Rank C)


<u>The effectiveness of antibiotic therapy is assessed:</u>

o '''Clinically:''' regression of signs of infection, sepsis, or related to secondary localisations.

o '''Persistent negativation of blood cultures'''

NB: Echocardiographic and radiological lesions may persist despite microbiological cure. They are not considered reliable criteria for short-term follow-up.


In the case of AE on equipment (prosthetic valve, etc.), specialist advice (including surgery) is essential, as antibiotic therapy is usually not sufficient to bring about recovery.


In the absence of formal cure criteria, ''cure is controlled by the absence of AR relapse''.
