<u>L''''échocardiographie''' is the reference test for:</u>

*visualise valve vegetations
*search for associated cardiac complications (cord rupture, abscess, valvular destruction, prosthesis deinsertion, paravalvular leak)
*assess the severity of valve leaks and their impact on the heart''.


An echocardiogram should be performed immediately if there is a clinical suspicion.


<u>'''Echocardiographic evaluation is done in two stages:'''</u>

'''1) Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)''' is routinely performed as a first-line procedure:

*Rapid, non-invasive and available in many centres
*Only 70% sensitive for positive diagnosis of IE

2) A transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) must then be performed in the event of a positive TEE, but also in the event of a negative TEE with clinical suspicion of endocarditis:

*TEE increases sensitivity for the positive diagnosis of AR (≥ 90%), particularly in cases of AR on prostheses,
*TEE can be used to diagnose valve complications.
