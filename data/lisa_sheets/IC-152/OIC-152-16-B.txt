The infectious '''[[Knowing the entry points according to the infectious agent 2C-152-EP-A01|entry point]]''' of an IE:

-> must be ''systematically'' investigated by a ''targeted clinical examination'' and/or ''additional tests'' (some of which must be carried out as a matter of course).

-> is guided by the type of "infectious agent" identified by blood cultures.

Its discovery then requires ''specific therapeutic management,'' in order to eradicate it and ''prevent recurrence of the IE'' (Table).
