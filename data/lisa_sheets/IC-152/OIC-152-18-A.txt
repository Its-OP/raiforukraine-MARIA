<u>Rational:</u>

AEs occur in the aftermath of bacteremia, possibly following a high-risk procedure (certain dental treatments).

Most bacteria of dental origin are sensitive to "narrow spectrum" antibiotics such as amoxicillin.

The aim of antibiotic prophylaxis is to limit the onset or duration of bacteremia, by administering the antibiotic just before the high-risk procedure, in order to achieve peak concentration at the time of the bacteremic episode.


<u>Indication:</u>

Antibiotic prophylaxis is justified ''only'' ''when 2 conditions are met'' :

'''1) Patient at high risk of AR (2C-152-PE-A01)''''

*Know that any patient with a valve prosthesis is at risk of infection (infective endocarditis, graft) 2C-153-IU-A01|Valve prosthesis
*A history of IE
*Cyanogenic congenital heart disease

'''<u>And</u> 2) High-risk dental care'''

*Procedures requiring manipulation of the gum or periapical region or mucosal invasion


'''In all other situations''' (other heart disease or other procedures involving the airway, digestive tract, urinary tract or skin), '''<u>antibioprophylaxis is not justified.</u>''''


<u>Terms and conditions:</u>

*Amoxicillin per os in a single dose within an hour of the procedure
*In case of allergy: clindamycin
*Patients deemed to be at high risk of IE must be issued with a "patient at risk of infective endocarditis" card, which must be presented before any oral or dental procedure.
