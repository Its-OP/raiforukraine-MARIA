Complementary neurological examinations are guided by the topographical diagnosis ([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]], [[Request for an imaging examination SD-231|Request for an imaging examination]]).

Cerebral MRI (or, failing that, CT scan) if there are signs pointing to supramedullary involvement:

- cerebral MRI is the preferred first-line treatment for most pathologies;

- if MRI is not accessible or contraindicated, a brain scan without or sometimes with injection should be performed;

- in the event of cerebral infarction, magnetic resonance angiography or cervico-encephalic angioscanner are essential to search for arterial occlusion ([[Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-226|Discovery of a brain abnormality on medical imaging examination]]).

The time taken to carry out these tests depends on the aetiological hypotheses:

- Any sudden or acute neurological deficit should raise the suspicion of a stroke and require urgent brain imaging;

- any head injury with focal neurological signs requires a brain scan without injection to be performed immediately;

- emergency imaging is essential for any suspected infectious encephalic pathology;

- Spinal cord imaging should be carried out as a matter of urgency for any spinal cord syndrome or acute cauda equina syndrome;

- in the case of progressive deficits, in the absence of any sign of seriousness (vigilance problems, etc.), additional tests should be carried out as soon as possible (within 24 hours).


- Cervico-dorso-lumbar MRI for spinal cord syndrome or lumbar MRI for cauda equina syndrome.
