- Involvement of the ''central nervous system'' (encephalic or spinal cord lesion) is evoked when :

- involvement of a hemicompartment (motor or sensory) ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]); presence of signs of cortical involvement: aphasia ([[Speech and/or phonation disorder SD-134|Speech and/or phonation disorder]])

- homonymous lateral hemianopia ([[Vision abnormality SD-138|Vision abnormality]]) or cognitive (aphasia...) ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|Speech and/or phonation disorders]]), gnostic disorders ;

- associated vigilance disorders ([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|Coma and consciousness disorders]]);

- association with an epileptic seizure ([[Convulsions SD-120|Convulsions]]) ;

- damage to the cranial pairs or oculomotricity associated with damage to the long tracts, pointing to damage to the brain stem;

- pyramidal signs ;

- a frank abdominal or thoracic sensory level (spinal cord).

- Involvement of the ''peripheral nervous system'' (on the roots, plexuses, nerve trunks) is evoked when :

- fasciculations, amyotrophy ;

- a motor or sensory deficit ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]) of radicular or truncal "topography" systematised in one (or more) nerve root(s) or trunk(s) ;

- a reduction or abolition of tendon reflexes - non-specific, as this is also the case in the initial "flaccid" phase of a motor deficit of central origin;

- distal involvement of the lower limbs without vesicosphincter disorders.
