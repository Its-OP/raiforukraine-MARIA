Loss of mobility may be of non-neurological origin. It is then a functional impotence which can be :

- of osteoarticular origin: fracture, sprain, arthritis, cuff rupture, etc. :

- pain (+++) ([[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]], [[Joint pain SD-067|Joint pain]]) is most often in the foreground;

- Clinical examination and imaging can then be used to identify the bone or joint lesion involved;

- of peripheral vascular origin: acute arterial occlusion (very painful, white or necrotic limb, peripheral pulse not felt), phlebitis, haematoma; here again, pain is almost constant.

- for speech disorders ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|Speech and/or phonation disorders]]), balance disorders ([[Balance disorders SD-130|Balance disorders]]) and vision disorders ([[Vision anomaly SD-138|Vision anomaly]]), the cause may be non-neurological, of local origin (ENT or ophthalmological).
