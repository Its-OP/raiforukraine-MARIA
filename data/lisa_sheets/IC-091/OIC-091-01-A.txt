A focal neurological deficit is the loss of function due to a temporary dysfunction (transient deficit) or lesion (permanent deficit) of a region of the nervous system. It is to be distinguished from a global suffering of the brain as in loss of consciousness, coma ([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|Coma and consciousness disorders]]) or confusional syndromes.
