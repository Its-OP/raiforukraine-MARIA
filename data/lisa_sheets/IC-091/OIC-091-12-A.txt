The three main causes of transient neurological deficit are shown in the table below:
{| class="wikitable"
|
|TIA
|Epileptic seizure
|Migraine aura
|-
|Terrain
|> Age 50

Vascular risk factors
|Variable

Known history of epilepsy or similar episodes (stereotyped seizures)
|< under 50 years of age

History of migraine
|-
|Mode of onset
|Evocative if sudden and immediately maximal
|Epileptic walking from near to near over several tens of seconds
|Migrainous walk" with extension of disorders over several tens of minutes
|-
|Type of symptoms
|Negative": amputation of visual field, loss of sensitivity
|Positive: paresthesias, visual illusions or hallucinations
|Positive: luminous (scintillating scotoma) and/or coloured visual phenomena

Symptoms mainly visual and sensory
|-
|''Associated signs'''
|Vascular murmur

Heart disease
|Clonia in motor seizures

Break in contact, amnesia of the episode (complex partial attacks)
|[[Headache SD-118|Headache]] migraine: hemicrania, photo-sono-phobia, digestive signs
|-
|'''Resolution of symptoms''''
|Fast
|Rapid
|Progressive

Duration of deficit < 1 h
|}
Other causes of transient neurological deficit are: hypoglycaemia ([[Hypoglycaemia SD-209|Hypoglycaemia]]), subdural haematoma, cerebral tumour, vascular malformation or other cerebral lesions, truncal peripheral involvement by postural or external compression (Saturday night radial paralysis...).
