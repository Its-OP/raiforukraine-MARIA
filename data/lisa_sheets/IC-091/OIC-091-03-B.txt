A deficit may have a psychogenic origin, in which case it is a somatoform disorder: a motor or sensory territory that is slightly "aberrant", non-anatomical, with discordance on clinical examination, changing complaints, "beautiful indifference", etc. Somatoform disorders may occur in different contexts: hysteria (conversion), simulation, depressive syndrome, etc.
