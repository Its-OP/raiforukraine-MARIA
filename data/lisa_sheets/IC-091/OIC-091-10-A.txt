Non-radiological examinations depend on the aetiological orientation: blood tests (infectious samples, muscle enzymes, toxic assays, etc.), ECG ([[Performing and interpreting an electrocardiogram (ecg) SD-185|Performing an electrocardiogram (ECG)]])...


- Electromyogram (EMG) in cases of suspected damage to the peripheral nervous system (roots, plexuses, nerve trunk), neuromuscular junction or muscles.

- EEG in case of suspected epileptic seizure.

- '''Lumbar puncture for study of CSF''' ([[Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (lcs) SD-183|Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)]]):

- if polyradiculoneuritis is suspected;

- if an infectious or inflammatory process is suspected: this should be carried out after brain (or spinal cord) imaging, given the presence of a focal neurological deficit.
