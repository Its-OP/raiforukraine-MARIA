All causes of acute respiratory failure may be considered, especially in atypical forms:

- ARDS

- Asthma attacks

- Pulmonary embolism :

- decompensation of COPD,

- Pneumonia,

- tamponade,

- pleural effusion or pneumothorax

- acute pneumonia,

- decompensated respiratory failure.



Look for associated symptoms suggesting a non-cardiogenic cause:

o Coughing, expectoration (bronchopulmonary infection)

o Associated respiratory sounds (wheezing, wheezing)

o Auscultatory abnormalities (crackles, sibilants, bronchial rales, localised abolition of the vesicular murmur)

o Chest percussion abnormalities (dullness or tympany)

o Palpation abnormalities (increased or reduced vocal vibration)

o Fever

o Signs of Phlebitis
