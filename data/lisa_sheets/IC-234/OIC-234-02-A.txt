Several definitions of heart failure co-exist:

- From a pathophysiological point of view, CI is defined as an inability of the heart to deliver sufficient flow to meet the body's needs and/or to function with normal filling pressures.

- There is also a universal definition of CHF: this is a clinical syndrome with past or present symptoms of CHF (dyspnoea, fatigue) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac anomaly and confirmed by several elements: clinical signs of heart failure (crackles, ankle oedema, jugular turgidity); an elevated level of natriuretic peptide; haemodynamic echocardiographic radiological signs.

Heart failure is classified according to the level of left ventricular ejection fraction, which corresponds to the proportion of blood ejected with each beat in relation to the ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEF (%) = (end-diastolic volume - telesystolic volume)/end-diastolic volume; see Figure). Three types of CI are classically distinguished:

Ø ''Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%)'' caused by failure of myocardial contraction.

Ø ''Systolic heart failure or heart failure with a slightly reduced ejection fraction between 41 and 49%'' generally combines the characteristics of the other two types.

Ø '''Diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction LVEF ≥50%.''' This is caused by a failure to fill the left ventricle (relaxation compliance).


This definition has therapeutic implications, as most treatment options concern heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤40%).
