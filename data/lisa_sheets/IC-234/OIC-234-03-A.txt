Pathophysiological definition:

- Sudden onset of acute respiratory distress associated with an increase in left ventricular filling pressure.

- CI leads to a sudden increase in left ventricular filling pressures. This increase in LV pressure is associated with an increase in pressure in the left atrium and pulmonary capillaries (> 25 mmHg). This pressure is higher than the interstitial oncotic pressure and results in the formation of a transudate in the pulmonary alveoli. The alveoli are "flooded" and haematosis is altered.

Remarks :

- OAP results in impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxaemia.

- It is associated with a compensatory mechanism resulting in hyperventilation, leading initially to hypocapnia.

- Clinical picture of acute respiratory failure associating :

o Dyspnoea with orthopnoea,

o Frothy expectoration

o Anxiety and agitation, sweating

o Peripheral cyanosis

o Crackles on pulmonary auscultation

This is a therapeutic emergency.
