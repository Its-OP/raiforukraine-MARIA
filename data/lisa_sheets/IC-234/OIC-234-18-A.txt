Therapeutic emergency

- Hospitalisation in a continuous care unit

- seated position

- placement of a venous supply line

- monitoring (heart rate, blood pressure, saturation, scope)

- oxygen therapy by nasal tube or mask, target Sa02 > 90%,

- Prescription of diuretics: injection of furosemide (Lasilix 1 mg/kg), then adjusted according to diuresis;

- injection of nitrate derivatives (trinitrine 1 mg/h to be adapted according to blood pressure) if systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg;

- in the event of severe uncontrolled anxiety or chest pain, offer i.v. morphine;

- treatment of a triggering factor: i.v. digoxin and effective anticoagulation if rapid atrial fibrillation, treatment of a hypertensive attack;

- systematic preventive anticoagulation.

- If there is no reply,

o CPAP ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure).

o If signs of acute respiratory failure and respiratory exhaustion persist: nasotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation.


- With regard to disease-modifying treatments

o Beta-blocker treatment to be introduced at a distance from the episode of PAO (weaning from oxygen)

o ACE inhibitors can be started rapidly, particularly if hypertension co-exists.
