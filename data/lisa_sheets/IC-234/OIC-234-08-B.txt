- The ejection fraction (EF) is the fraction of blood ejected during each systole as a percentage of the end-diastolic volume (EDV).

- Left ventricular EF is the parameter most commonly used to characterise left ventricular systolic function.

- It is measured by echocardiography (Figure 1).


- LVEF measurements can be used to classify 3 main types of heart failure:

o CI with reduced LVEF if LVEF ≤ 40%.

o CI with preserved LVEF if LVEF ≥ 50%.

o CI with moderately impaired LVEF if between 41% and 49%.


- The difference between these two mechanisms has therapeutic implications, as the majority of mortality-reducing treatments for heart failure currently target heart failure with reduced LVEF.
