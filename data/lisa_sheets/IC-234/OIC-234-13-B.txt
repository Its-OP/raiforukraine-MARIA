Echocardiography allows :

- Diagnosing CI

- Define IC Type

- Specify the mechanism of CI

- Looking for an aetiology

- Measuring filling pressures

- Monitoring and evolution (prognosis, LVEF)

- Adjust treatment


Various parameters will be measured;

- Geometry and segmental and global function of the left ventricle, measurement of LVEF value

- Testing for valvulopathy

- Assessment of right ventricular geometry and function,

- Haemodynamic assessment: cardiac output, diastolic function (relaxation, assessment of left ventricular filling pressures), assessment of pulmonary pressures including systolic pulmonary artery pressure by measuring tricuspid insufficiency flow, assessment of right ventricular filling pressures.

- Assessment of the pericardium (effusion, constriction)
