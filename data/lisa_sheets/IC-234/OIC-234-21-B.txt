- Heart failure is a serious disease

- Deaths: average mortality of 50% at five years


Causes of death :

- Chronic refractory heart failure, cardiac cachexia, cardiogenic shock leading to multivisceral failure

- End-stage renal failure: cardiorenal syndrome

- Episodes of acute heart failure

- Sudden death secondary to ventricular rhythm disturbances (VT, VF); sudden death due to electromechanical dissociation

- Thromboembolic complications: systemic embolism (stroke), pulmonary embolism (episodes of bed rest).
