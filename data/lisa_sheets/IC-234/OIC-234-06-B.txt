Acute lung oedema occurs when plasma fluid diffuses into the extravascular pulmonary spaces (interstitium, alveolus).

There are 2 types:

<br />

==== '''lesional oedema due to alteration of the alveolar-capillary membrane''' ====
- Linked to an increase in permeability due to damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane

- Pulmonary capillary pressure is normal or low < 18mmHg

- The oedema fluid has a very high protein content, close to that of plasma.

- This is responsible for acute respiratory failure, which can progress to interstitial fibrosis, known as ARDS.
<br />

==== '''cardiogenic pulmonary oedema due to pulmonary capillary hyperpressure''' ====
- Sudden or chronic increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)

- In the normal state, the PCP is of the order of 7-12 mmHg and the oncotic pressure is 25 mmHg.

- Above 25 mm Hg there is extravasation of fluid into the interstitial tissue and then into the alveolus, leading to haematosis disorders with hypoxaemia and a reduction in lung compliance.
