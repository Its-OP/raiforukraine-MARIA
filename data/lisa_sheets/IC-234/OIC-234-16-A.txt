'''Etiologies of left heart failure'''
<br />

====== '''Ischaemic heart disease''' ======
- With or without sequelae of myocardial infarction,

- Ventricular dysfunction in ischaemic but viable myocardium may be reversible after revascularisation (notion of myocardial sideration).

====== '''HTA''' ======
- frequently implicated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
<br />

====== '''Valvulopathies''' ======
All severe valvulopathies can be complicated by heart failure.

====== '''Cardiomyopathies''' ======
- dilated

o primary: no cause found (diagnosis of elimination)

o familial: in 25% of cases, related to a monogenic disease (mutation in a gene).

o toxic (alcohol, drugs such as cocaine);

o myocarditis (infectious, autoimmune) in the acute or sequelae phase

o endocrine (dysthyroidism, etc.); nutritional (thiamine deficiency); metabolic (haemochromatosis)

o pregnancy (post-partum cardiomyopathy) ;

o drugs, chemotherapy (anthracycline, herceptin).

- hypertrophic cardiomyopathies: sarcomeric, infiltrative (amyloidosis, Fabry disease)

- restrictive cardiomyopathies: cardiac amyloidosis, haemochromatosis, post-radiotherapy
<br />

====== '''Supra ventricular and ventricular rhythm disorders''' ======
causing heart failure or triggering factors.
<br />

====== '''Pericardial causes''' ======
Abundant pericardial effusion, tamponade, chronic constrictive pericarditis.

====== '''Specific causes of right heart failure''' ======
- left heart failure most common cause = congestive heart failure.

- Chronic respiratory insufficiency

- pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension and its causes: pulmonary embolism, anorectics, porto-pulmonary PAH, paraneoplastic, veno-occlusive and primary diseases, etc.

- arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia

- tricuspid valve disease

- right ventricular infarction;

- chronic constrictive pericarditis


====== '''Triggering factors''' ======
- Atrial fibrillation (AF) and other rhythm disorders

- Hypertensive flare-up

- Myocardial ischaemia / Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)

- Infections

- Pulmonary embolism (PE)

- Anemia

- Non-compliance with treatment

- Non-compliance with dietary hygiene rules (low-salt diet deviation)
