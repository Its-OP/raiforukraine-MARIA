====Clinical table====
- Sudden onset of acute respiratory distress,

- Often nocturnal

- Superficial polypnoea, very rapid, distressing and sometimes painful, with a sensation of a leaden cap on the shoulders.

- Associated signs: laryngeal crackling, cough with frothy, whitish or salmon-coloured sputum.

- Patient, often agitated, covered in sweat, forced to sit with legs dangling over the edge of the bed.

- Lung auscultation: bilateral crackling rales, rising from the bases to the peaks, in a veritable rising tide, frequently with associated unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion.

- Associated signs: sinus tachycardia; arrhythmia responsible for PAO; myocardial ischaemia.

- This may correspond to a cardiac pseudo-asthma mimicking an asthma attack: expiratory restraint, orthopnoea, non-productive cough and a mixture of sub-crepitating and sibilant rales on pulmonary auscultation (particularly in elderly patients).
