===''Left heart failure'''===
Definition: Heart failure in which the primary damage is to the left ventricle.

====Determinants of cardiac output:====

*Definitions :
**End-diastolic volume (EDV): Volume of blood contained in the ventricles at the end of ventricular diastole (160 ml) = pre-load volume.
**Telesystolic volume (TSV) : Volume of blood contained in the ventricles at the end of each systole (60 ml) = afterload volume.
**Systolic ejection volume (SEV): Volume of blood ejected from the heart by the ventricles during each contraction (100 ml) SEV = STEV - STV
**LVEF ejection fraction (%) = (STV-TSV)/STV
**Heart rate (Fc): Expressed in beats per minute bats/min (average = 60 - 70 bats/min).
**Cardiac output (Qc) = volume of blood expelled by each ventricle per unit of time: Expressed in litres per minute Qc = VES x Fc (average Qc = 5l/ min)
*The systolic ejection volume depends on :
**Intrinsic cardiac properties: inotropy and compliance (Cf. Figure below). These properties are altered in heart failure.
**Ventricular loading conditions. Preload corresponds to ventricular filling conditions in diastole. Afterload corresponds to ventricular ejection conditions in systole.

====Remodelling====

*Definition: a consequence of cardiac damage, it is a set of changes in genomic expression leading to molecular, cellular and interstitial changes which manifest themselves clinically as changes in the size, shape and function of the heart.
*This remodelling is present whatever the cause of the heart attack. It results in a short-term increase in inotropy or cardiac ejection volume. In the long term, however, it is associated with an alteration in ventricular geometry and function. It involves several phenomena: neurohormonal activation, altered calcium and mitochondrial metabolism, interstitial fibrosis, hypertrophy and cell death.

====Desynchronisation and arrhythmia====
Background: IC is accompanied by frequent changes in cardiac electrical activation; it is rare for an IC patient to have a strictly normal ECG.

Desynchronisation: electrical disorders of ventricular activation (first degree AVB, left bundle branch block) with haemodynamic consequences (shorter duration of diastole in the cardiac cycle, delayed contraction of the lateral wall on the septal wall in systole). This desynchronisation can be corrected by specific stimulation techniques such as resynchronisation.

Arrhythmias: all the changes encountered in heart failure (alteration of the ventricular substrate, neurohormonal activation, presence of electrical triggers) favour the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachycardias, fibrillation). These arrhythmias can be poorly tolerated and lead to sudden death. They can be prevented in cases of severe IC by installing a defibrillation system.

===''Right heart failure'''===
Right heart failure may be secondary to intrinsic damage to the right ventricle or to an increase in right ventricular afterload due to precapillary PH or postcapillary PH itself linked to left heart failure (the most frequent cause). The consequences of this right heart failure will be :

*remodelling of the VD: hypertrophy, dilatation and dysfunction
*Clinical signs of right heart failure: oedema of the lower limbs, jugular turgidity with ascites and hepatocellular insufficiency in the late stages. Imaging reveals dilatation of the IVC and reflux of blood into the suprahepatic veins.
