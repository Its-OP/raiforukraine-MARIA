Radiological signs of pulmonary stasis with '''Alveolo-interstitial syndrome:''''

- vascular redistribution from the base to the apices;

- interstitial oedema with Kerley's B lines, blurred appearance of the large hilar vessels and reticulo-nodular images predominating at the bases;

- alveolar oedema resulting in flaky opacities with blurred outlines extending from the hilum towards the periphery (a so-called "butterfly wing" appearance). These opacities are usually bilateral, but misleading unilateral forms may be seen (directional mitral insufficiency).

- uni- or bi-lateral pleural effusions.

- cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) may be increased (> 0.5 cardiomegaly)
