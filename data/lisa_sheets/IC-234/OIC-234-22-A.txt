The diagnosis of cardiogenic shock is made on clinical examination when there are

- Signs of heart failure

- low blood pressure

- associated with signs of peripheral hypoperfusion: oliguria, skin mottling, cold extremities, cyanosis, consciousness disorders.


The cardiogenic character is confirmed by the demonstration of a heart attack by echocardiography or catheterisation after exclusion or correction of hypovolaemia.

The haemodynamic criteria are as follows:

- systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg, for at least 30 minutes ;

- low cardiac output (index < 2.2 L/min/m2) ;

- pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAPO) > 15 mm Hg.


Details of treatment are given in item 232.
