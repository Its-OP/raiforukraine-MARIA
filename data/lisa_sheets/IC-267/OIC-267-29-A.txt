*''Hypernatremia: [Na+] > 145 mmol/L'''
*The diagnosis of intracellular dehydration (ICD) is biological: hypernatremia associated with plasma hyperosmolality (> 300 mOsm/Kg H20).
*Associated clinical signs:
**Thirst, sometimes intense.
**Neurological symptoms (= ''signs of seriousness''): non-specific and not very suggestive; correlated with the degree of hypernatremia and the speed of onset:
**Dryness of the mucous membranes, particularly on the inside of the cheeks.
**Polyuro-polydipsic syndrome if renal cause.
**Weight loss.
