'''1- Definition of hyperkalaemia:'''

*Hyperkalaemia is defined as a plasma potassium concentration greater than 5.0 mmol/L.
*False hyperkalaemia is due to the release of potassium from the intracellular compartment into the extracellular compartment in the sampling tube:
**Haemolysis during laborious sampling with a tight tourniquet;
**Late centrifugation of the tube (sampling at the patient's home);
**Major hyperleukocytosis (> 100,000/mm3) or thrombocythemia (> 1,000,000/mm3).


'''2- Measurement of blood kalaemia to check for hyperkalaemia:'''

*IRC
*CRL
*Prescription and monitoring of drugs that alter potassium metabolism (renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI-AR2), potassium-sparing diuretics, NSAIDs, etc.).
*Acute muscle disorder
*Heart conduction and rhythm disorders
*Shock
*Loss of consciousness
