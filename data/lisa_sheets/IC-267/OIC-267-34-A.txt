*Definitions
**Total hypocalcaemia is defined as a plasma concentration of less than 2.20 mmol/L, and ionised hypocalcaemia as a concentration of less than 1.15 mmol/L.
**<A distinction must be made between true hypocalcaemia, with a decrease in ionised calcium (regulated fraction), and false hypocalcaemia due to a decrease in the protein-bound fraction. More than 40% of serum calcium is bound to proteins, mainly albumin. In the case of hypoalbuminemia: corrected Ca = (40 - albumin) Ã— 0.025 + [total Ca].

*Calcemia measurement to look for hypocalcemia when :
**symptoms suggestive of hypocalcaemia (neuromuscular disorders, cardiac disorders)
**pathology at risk of hypocalcaemia (chronic renal failure, history of parathyroid surgery).
