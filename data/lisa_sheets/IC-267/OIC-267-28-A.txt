If the hyponatremia is chronic, the disorder must be corrected very carefully, as there is a high risk of centropontine myelinolysis or osmotic demyelination (a rare but formidable complication). This risk is increased when chronic hyponatraemia has been corrected too quickly (''> 10 mmol/L/24 h'') and when this hyponatraemia evolved in a context of hypoxia, malnutrition and ethylism.
