*Treatment of hyponatremia includes aetiological treatment and symptomatic treatment, which consists of reducing excess water.
*The amount of excess water is estimated using the following formula: Excess Water = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1)

*In chronic hyponatremia, priority should be given to :
**Etiological treatment (discontinuation of a drug, treatment of a cause of SIADH, etc.).
**Fluid restriction (500 mL/d) is always recommended and allows hyponatremia to be gradually corrected over several days.
**Associated symptomatic treatment, which depends on the state of the extracellular sector.
***In the event of associated extracellular dehydration, additional NaCl intake (orally or with isotonic saline solution at 9 g/L, 0.5 to 1L/h).
***In cases of extracellular euvolaemia due to SIADH, hyponatraemia may be corrected by fluid restriction alone. If the dilution disorder is very marked (very high OsmU), fluid restriction alone may be insufficient. In this case:
****adding osmoles by administering urea orally (0.25 to 0.50 g/kg diluted in orange juice).
****If these approaches fail, the use of a specific V2 ADH receptor antagonist (tolvaptan 15 to 60 mg/d orally) may be discussed if the hyponatremia is chronic and after specialist advice.
****In cases of extracellular euvolaemia with imbalance in water intake vs. osmoles ("tea and toast" syndrome), water restriction and/or increased osmole intake (animal proteins, NaCl) are generally sufficient.
***In cases of associated extracellular hyperhydration: sodium restriction and loop diuretics.

*Rate of correction: in these cases, the rate of correction of hyponatremia ''must not exceed 10 mmol/L/day for the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L for the following 24 hours'' (a total of 18 mmol/L over 48 hours).
*In emergency cases of severe hyponatraemia (Na < 120 mOsm/kg H2O), whether acute or chronic, and responsible for moderate to severe symptoms (consciousness disorders, comitiveness, vomiting), the following regimen may be proposed:
**Rapid infusion of hypertonic NaCl (3% NaCl 150 mL IV over 20 min, renewable 2 times depending on the control natremia), with the initial aim of increasing the natremia by 5 mmol/L.
**NaCl 9 ‰ (if blood volume is reduced and urinary osmolality is below 300-350 mOsm/Kg) may then be administered, with the aim of not exceeding +10 mmol/L natraemia in the first 24 hours and 8 mmol/L over the following 24 hours (i.e. ≤ 18 mmol/L over 48 hours) until 130 mmol/L is reached.
**Monitoring in an intensive care unit is essential, as is the correction of any hypoxia.
**In a second phase, treatment reverts to that of asymptomatic hyponatremia.
**Associated hypokalaemia must be corrected (with KCl). This increases the risk of rapid correction of the natraemia, particularly in patients with initial volume depletion (treatment with thiazides).
