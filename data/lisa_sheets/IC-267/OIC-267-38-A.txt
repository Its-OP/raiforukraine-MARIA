*The reasoning behind hypocalcaemia is based on a few simple biological tests:
**total calcium
**ionised calcium and/or albumin
**serum phosphate
**plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH)
**vitamin D (25 OH vitamin D) and calcitriolemia (1.25 OH vitamin D)
**24-hour calciuria

*The diagnostic approach consists of distinguishing
**hypocalcaemia with low PTH (<10pg/mL) and therefore inadequate PTH. This is known as hypocalcaemia of parathyroid origin.
**hypocalcaemia with high PTH (>65 pg/mL) and therefore adapted. This is referred to as hypocalcaemia of extraparathyroidal origin.
