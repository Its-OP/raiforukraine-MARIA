*Treatment of the cause if possible, such as stopping treatment, correcting vitamin D deficiency or hypomagnesaemia.

*Symptomatic treatment
**Calcium per os (calcium carbonate): 500 mg to 1.5 g/day between meals (500 mg/day only if chronic renal failure).
**Parenteral calcium (calcium gluconate or calcium chloride) in cases of severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia (care must be taken to avoid extravasation).

*Special cases
**Chronic renal failure
***Supplementation with vitamin D hydroxylated in position 1 (Un-Alfa速) or 1.25 (Rocaltrol速) provided there is no significant hyperphosphatemia.
***Calcium intake
**Hypoparathyroidism
***Supplementation with vitamin D hydroxylated in position 1 (Un-Alfa速) or 1.25 (Rocaltrol速)
***Calcium intake
***Monitor calciuria (significant risk of hypercalciuria)
**Rhabdomyolysis
***Calcium intake only if symptomatic (risk of rebound hypercalcaemia)
