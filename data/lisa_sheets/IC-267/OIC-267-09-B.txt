*treatment of the cause +++ ;
*CO2 elimination: correction of low flow, artificial ventilation;
*alkalinisation :
**discussed in lactic acidosis,
**not recommended in ketoacidosis: insulin and rehydration are often sufficient,
**essential in hyperchloremic acidosis or acidosis associated with certain intoxications: IV sodium bicarbonate to rapidly raise pH > 7.20 and bicarbonaemia > 10 mmol/L: quantity HCO3<sup>-</sup> (mmol) = ∆ [HCO3<sup>-</sup> ] × 0.5 × weight (kg);
**Alkalinisation should be avoided in cases of fluid and sodium overload and/or hypokalaemia and/or hypocalcaemia.
*extrarenal purification if associated with organic renal insufficiency (to avoid sodium bicarbonate infusion-induced sodium water overload);
