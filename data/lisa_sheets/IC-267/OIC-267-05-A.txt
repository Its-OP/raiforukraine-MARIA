'''1. first step: confirm metabolic acidosis'''

*Acidosis = arterial blood pH < 7.38 (or venous pH < 7.32)
*Metabolic = HCO3 < 22 mmol/L (with secondary fall in PCO2 by ventilatory compensation)

'''2.     Second step: characterise whether the metabolic acidosis is simple, mixed or complex''''

*Simple: PaCO2 = expected PaCO2
*Mixed: PaCO2 > expected PaCO2
*Complex: PaCO2 < expected PaCO2

'''3.     Third step: determine the plasma anion gap: BP = [Na<sup>+</sup>] + [K<sup>+</sup>] - [Cl<sup>-</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup>] = 16 Â± 4 mmol/L''''

Variations in BP make it possible to assess whether the anion accompanying the excess H<sup>+</sup> (and therefore the loss of HCO3<sup>-</sup>) is chlorine (the anion measured) or indosed anions.

*Acidosis with normal anion gap (HCl gain): renal or digestive loss of HCO3<sup>-</sup> -->decrease in HCO3<sup>-</sup> compensated by a proportional increase in Cl<sup>-</sup> (HCl gain) --> hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
*Acidosis with high anion gap (BP > 20 mmol/L): addition of H+ associated with an indosed anion (AH gain)--> drop in [HCO3<sup>-</sup>] replaced by an unmeasured anion (eg lactate).

'''4.     To diagnose metabolic acidosis with increased plasma anion gap:''''

*Lactic acidosis (lactate assay): acidosis and BP secondary to lactic acid accumulation:
**Shock with tissue hypoxia,
**Biguanide toxicity (in the event of overdosage in renal failure)
*Ketoacidosis (determination of ketonemia; ketonuria by urine dipstick): acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of ketoacids:
**Diabetic ketoacidosis,
**Less common: alcoholic ketoacidosis, fasting ketoacidosis.
*Severe renal failure (acute or chronic): acidosis secondary to failure of the kidney to eliminate H<sup>+</sup> ions and BP secondary to accumulation of anions not eliminated by the kidney (organic acids, phosphate ion, sulphate ion...). The BP is not very high (< 26 mmol/L).
*Intoxication with an exogenous acid: acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of the exogenous acid:
**salicylate, ethylene glycol, methanol.

'''5.     Make the diagnosis of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (normal plasma anion gap)'''

*Digestive loss of bicarbonate: diarrhoea, ileostomy, etc.
*Renal tubular acidosis.
