*If severe hypokalaemia (cardiac disorders, increased QT or neuromuscular signs), restore kalaemia > 3 mmol/L (intravenously).
*Avoid glucose intake during the initial phase of correction of severe hypokalaemia (risk of initial worsening by insulin secretion induced by glucose intake).
*Administration of 0.5 to 1.5 g per hour: repeated monitoring of kalaemia, heart rate and infused vein (venotoxicity). The patient must be scoped.
*Systematic correction of associated hypomagnesemia.
*Oral potassium supplementation is usually sufficient (food, KCl in).
