*Hyponatremia: [Na+] < 135 mmol/L''; ''Severe hyponatremia'' (biological definition) = < 120 mmol/L.
*The diagnosis of intracellular hyperhydration (ICH) is biological: hyponatraemia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality.
*Hyponatremia reflects plasma hypo-osmolality (POsm < 280 mOsm/kg). It is therefore "the consequence of excess water". It is associated with intracellular hyperhydration (ICH). The increase in intracellular volume is due to a transfer of water from the extracellular sector to the intracellular sector as a result of plasma hypo-osmolality. Hyponatremia associated with plasma hypo-osmolality is explained by a relative water content higher than the sodium stock, which may be normal (pure HIC), increased (HIC + HEC = global hyperhydration) or decreased (HIC + DEC).
*Indications for prescribing a natraemia:
**Neurological or digestive symptoms (see clinical signs),
**monitoring of diuretic treatment,
**pulmonary, cerebral or endocrine pathologies associated with hyponatraemia,
**conditions responsible for hyponatremia: heart failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.
