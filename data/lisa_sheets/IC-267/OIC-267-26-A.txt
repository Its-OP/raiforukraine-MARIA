*This section describes the general diagnostic approach to hypotonic hyponatremia.
*The first step is to rule out non-hypo-osmotic hyponatremia, where hyponatremia is associated with normal or elevated plasma osmolality (direct measurement of plasma osmolality using an osmometer is useful):
**factitious hyponatremia" in cases of hyperprotidemia and hyperlipidemia
**hyponatremia (or iso or hypertonic hyponatremia): during major hyperglycaemia or intoxication by methanol or ethanol, there is dehydration of the intracellular sector and plasma hyperosmolality.

*'''The second step''' consists of assessing, using urinary osmolality, whether the kidneys are diluting the urine in a manner appropriate to the context of hyponatremia (Uosm < 100 mOsm/kg H2O).
*The third stage involves clinical assessment of the extracellular compartment and effective blood volume, which provides information on the sodium balance (negative in the case of extracellular dehydration, normal in the case of extracellular euvolaemia, positive in the case of extracellular hyperhydration). There are 3 different situations in the case of :
**Extracellular dehydration: lack of NaCl intake, digestive, cutaneous or renal loss of NaCl.
**Isolated intracellular hyperhydration: SIADH or potomania.
**Global hyperhydration: this is usually due to heart failure, cirrhosis or nephrotic syndrome, all of which are responsible for volo-dependent stimulation of ADH by effective hypovolaemia. It may also be advanced renal failure.

|- Posm < 275 mOsm/kg

- Uosm > 100 mOsm/kg (in hyponatremic conditions)

- Clinical euvolaemia

- UNa > 30 mmol/L (with normal sodium and water intake)

- No hypothyroidism

- No adrenal insufficiency

- Normal renal function and absence of recent diuretic treatment

- Uricemia < 240 Î¼mol/L
