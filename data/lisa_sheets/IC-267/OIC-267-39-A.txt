*Before investigating the aetiology of hypocalcaemia, it is important to check that
**the sample has not been taken in a citrate tube (citrate chelates calcium)
**that it is not a pseudo hypocalcaemia (hypoalbuminaemia)

* The etiological investigation is detailed in the table below. It is based on a syndromic approach in relation to the values of
** total and ionised calcium levels
** PTH
** calcitriol
** vitamin D
** calciuria
