Depending on the state of the extracellular volume, 3 situations can be distinguished:

*'''''Global dehydration (hypovolaemia associated with a water deficit more marked than the sodium deficit)''':'''
**lack of water and NaCl intake, with water intake lower than NaCl intake
**digestive, cutaneous or renal loss of water and NaCl, with greater water loss than NaCl loss.

*''''' Isolated intracellular dehydration (associated extracellular euvolaemia)'''.''' They are linked to :
**Uncompensated water loss of :
***Extrarenal "insensitive" (the renal response here is normal, urine is concentrated (U/P osm > 1) and there is no polyuria):
****cutaneous: heat stroke, burn;
****respiratory: polypnoea, prolonged hyperventilation, hyperthermia;
****digestive: osmotic diarrhoea.
***Renal: Hypotonic polyuria (U/P osm ≤ 1) with plasma hyperosmolality, characteristic of diabetes insipidus (Table 4). Induced polyuria is compensated by polydipsia (polyuro-polydipsic syndrome), hypernatremia occurs when the patient has reduced access to water:
****to diabetes insipidus of central origin linked to the complete or partial absence of ADH secretion
****nephrogenic diabetes insipidus characterised by a reduced or abolished renal response to ADH. Urinary osmolality is low and unaffected by the administration of synthetic ADH (dDAVP= minirin®).
**A deficit in water intake:
***hypothalamic abnormalities: primary hypodipsia
***lack of free access to water: infants, dependent elderly subjects, comatose patients (stroke)
***lack of water (desert areas)
*'''''Extracellular hyperhydration and intracellular dehydration'': '''Massive sodium intake'''''
**especially in children, when hypertonic bicarbonate solution is used or after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
**NaCl poisoning
