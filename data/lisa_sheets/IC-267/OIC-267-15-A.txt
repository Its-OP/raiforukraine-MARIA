*If hyperkalaemia is suspected, an ECG should be performed immediately. It is essential to assess the degree of severity in order to decide on symptomatic treatment. If there are conduction problems or neuromuscular signs, treatment must be given as a matter of extreme urgency.
*Severe hyperkalaemia (kalaemia > 7 mmol/L) or an electrocardiographic threat is an absolute emergency:
**Hyperkalaemic drugs must be stopped.
**Membrane antagonist limiting hypoexcitability induced by hyperkalaemia:
***IV calcium salts (10 to 30 ml), except if digitalis is present (in which case use a magnesium salt).
**Transfer of K to the intracellular compartment:
***insulin-glucose (e.g. 500 ml G10% + 10-15 U rapid insulin over 30 minutes)
