*Myocardial damage leads to a state of cardiac hyperexcitability.
**The ECG signs present include the following, depending on the degree of hypokalaemia:
**ST segment depression (from V1 to V3 and in DII);
**Decrease or even inversion of the T wave;
**Appearance of a "pathological" U wave in V3 and DII (slowing of repolarisation);
**Prolongation of the QT interval;
**Supraventricular rhythm disorders (atrial fibrillation, sinus tachycardia);
**Ventricular rhythm disorders (ventricular extrasystoles, ventricular tachycardia, torsade de pointe, ventricular fibrillation).
*In the context of chronic hypokalaemia, the potassium ratio between the intracellular and extracellular sectors is relatively constant and explains the absence of ECG signs, even when kalaemia levels are below 3 mmol/L.
*The onset of arrhythmia is favoured by :
**underlying ischaemic heart disease;
**left ventricular hypertrophy;
**hypercalcaemia;
**treatment with digitalis or anti-arrhythmics;
**the occurrence of torsade de pointes is favoured by hypomagnesaemia.
