A.    pH and the acid-base buffer system

*Hydrogen potential (pH) = Log 1/[H<sup>+</sup> ]. The concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in plasma is very low and finely regulated.
*The quantity of H<sup>+</sup> entering the body through the diet is massive compared with its plasma concentration. To avoid a collapse of the post-prandial pH, incompatible with cellular life, the acid load is immediately buffered. The main acid-base buffer system in humans is the carbonic acid/bicarbonate pair: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> ⇔ H2CO3 ⇔ CO2 + H2O
*This buffer system is said to be "open" because the acid generated is eliminated by respiration, and the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidney.
*Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH<sub>blood</sub> = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/[H2CO3]) = 6.1 + log<sub>10</sub> ([HCO3<sup>-</sup> ]/0.03 PC02)
*The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation shows that the pH varies when the ratio between PCO2 and HCO3<sup>-</sup> is modified, i.e. :
**when there is a primary change in the concentration of HCO3<sup>-</sup> ions. This is known as alkalosis or metabolic acidosis,
**or when there is a primary change in PCO2. This is known as respiratory alkalosis or acidosis.

B.    The main sources of acid

*There are two main sources of acid:
**Volatile acids, derived from the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, generating, in the presence of O2, water and CO2 (oxidative metabolism). The CO2 generated is eliminated directly by respiration, without modifying the acid-base balance in a physiological situation. Failure of ventilation to eliminate CO2 leads to respiratory acidosis.
**Fixed acids, resulting from protein metabolism (H2SO4 for sulphur-containing amino acids, HCl for lysine, H2P04 for nucleoproteins). This acid load is around 1 mmol/kg/d and is buffered before being eliminated by the kidneys. Failure by the kidney to eliminate this acid load (renal failure or renal tubular acidosis) leads to metabolic acidosis.

C.    Role of the lung in acid-base balance

*By excreting carbon dioxide through the respiratory tract, the lung modifies the pCO2 of arterial blood. A failure to eliminate CO2 through alveolar hypoventilation leads to respiratory acidosis. Conversely, increased elimination of CO2 by alveolar hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis.
*Regulation of pulmonary ventilation depends on PaO2 and pCO2, but also on the pH of arterial blood. By reflex mechanism, through the intermediary of sensitive devices (aortic and carotid chemoreceptors and central chemoreceptors), a fall in blood pH leads instantaneously to an increase in ventilation, and vice versa.

D.    Role of the kidney in acid-base balance

*Reabsorption of bicarbonates filtered by the glomerulus. If this function is impaired, it can lead to metabolic acidosis. This is a function of the proximal parts of the renal tubule.
*Excretion of the fixed acid load (approximately 60 mEq/d), which is equivalent to regenerating the bicarbonates consumed. This is a function of the distal parts of the nephron (collecting duct). Failure of this kidney function leads to metabolic acidosis. In the case of chronic respiratory acidosis, renal compensation leads to an increase in bicarbonate generation and therefore in bicarbonate levels.
