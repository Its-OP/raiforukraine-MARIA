*Treatment is aetiological (discontinuation of medication, treatment of diabetes mellitus), preventive (especially in patients who do not have free access to water) and symptomatic.
*In the case of acute symptomatic hypernatremia in adults, the initial rate of correction should be 2 mmol/L/h (without exceeding 10-12 mmol/L/d).
*When hypernatremia has been present for a long time, the rate of correction should not exceed 0.5 mmol/L/h, i.e. 10-12 mmol/L/24h, to avoid inducing cerebral oedema and convulsions.
*The amount of water to be administered can be estimated using the following formula: Water deficit = 60% × weight × ([Natremia/140] - 1).
*Water can be administered in the form of :
**drinking water orally or via a gastric tube;
**5% glucose solution (50 g per L) or 2.5% glucose solution (25 g per L) intravenously;
**hypo-osmotic sodium chloride solution (4.5 ‰ NaCl).

*The most appropriate form will be chosen according to the patient's state of consciousness, whether or not there is nausea or vomiting, and the state of hydration of the extracellular compartment. Schematically:
**in the event of overall dehydration, priority should be given to correcting blood volume by administering hypotonic saline at 4.5 g/L;
**in the case of pure intracellular dehydration, drinking water should be given (never give pure water intravenously, as this would induce haemolysis);
**in the event of associated extracellular hyperhydration, a diuretic with pure water (PO) or a hypotonic solution (IV) should be prescribed.
