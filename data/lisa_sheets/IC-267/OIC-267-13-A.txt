*Cardiac symptoms are manifested by progressive electrocardiographic changes which are, successively and in order of severity:
**Accelerated repolarisation with an increase in the amplitude of the T waves, which are sharp and symmetrical and may exceed the peak of the R wave, clearly seen in the anterior (V2 to V4) and posterior (DII and DIII) leads.
**Atrial conduction abnormalities (decrease then disappearance of the P wave), auriculo-ventricular conduction abnormalities (sino-auricular and auriculo-ventricular blocks).
**Then intraventricular conduction abnormalities with widening of the QRS complexes.
**Then bradycardia with wide QRS (known as the "sine wave pattern") preceding asystole.
*Ventricular arrhythmias (idiopathic ventricular rhythm, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation) may occur if hyperkalaemia is associated with myocardial ischaemia, severe hypocalcaemia, hypothermia, severe acidosis, digitalis intoxication or severe vagal stimulation.
