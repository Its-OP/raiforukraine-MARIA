1- Toxic causes: Intoxication with an exogenous acid: acidosis and BP secondary to accumulation of the exogenous acid:

*salicylate, ethylene glycol, methanol...

2- Renal tubular acidosis :

*The main form of renal elimination of excess protons (H<sup>+</sup> ) is the ammonium ion (NH4<sup>+</sup>). In hyperchloremic acidosis, the renal response can be assessed by calculating the urinary anion gap (UAG), which is the (inverse) reflection of ammoniuria. UAT = U<sub>Na</sub> + U<sub>K</sub> - U<sub>Cl</sub>.
*Physiologically, TAU is discreetly positive.
*In hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis:
**'''If the TAU is < 0''' (= high urinary NH4<sup>+</sup> concentration = adapted renal response) --> extrarenal origin of the acidosis (digestive loss of bicarbonate).
**'''If the TAU is > 0''' (= low urinary NH4<sup>+</sup> concentration = inadequate renal response) --> renal tubular origin (Table 3).
