Glomerular origin :

* context: oedema, diabetes, general illness (lupus, etc.)
* presence of significant proteinuria or even nephrotic syndrome
* micro or macroscopic haematuria, very frequent hypertension

Interstitial origin :

* context: recurrent urinary tract infections, medications with interstitial risk
* presence of very moderate proteinuria (< 1 g/24h)
* germ-free leucocyturia, no hypertension

Vascular origin :

* background: long-standing, poorly controlled hypertension with cardiac repercussions
* risk factors and cardiovascular history
* confirmation by renal ultrasound with Doppler
