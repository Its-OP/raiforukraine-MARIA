Chronic metabolic acidosis results in :

* excessive muscle protein catabolism,
* worsening of renal osteodystrophy lesions,
* increased risk of hyperkalaemia.

Correction of metabolic acidosis :

* aims to achieve a blood bicarbonate level of over 22 mmol/L,
* requires the use of alkalinising agents such as sodium bicarbonate (e.g. NaHCO3 capsules, 3 to 6 grams per day).
