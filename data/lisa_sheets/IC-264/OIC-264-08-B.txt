In addition to the risk of death, CKD is associated with a risk of progression to stage 5. This risk is assessed by estimating the annual decline calculated as follows: GFR year n - GFR year n+1.

* Physiological" annual decline observed after the age of 40: â‰¤ 1 ml/min/1.73 m2/year (green curve in the figure below);
* moderate" annual decline: > 1 and < 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year;
* rapid' annual decline: â‰¥ 5 ml/min/1.73 m2/year.

Whether the decline is moderate or rapid (red curve below), the aim is to curb the slope of the decline (yellow dotted curve below).
