Strict control of [[Hypertension in adults and children|blood pressure]] can slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Blood pressure must be :

*less than 130/80 mmHg in CKD patients with albuminuria ≥ 30 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinuria) whether or not they have diabetes;
*less than 140/90 mmHg in CKD patients with albuminuria < 30 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinuria);
*above 110 mmHg systolic in all cases.

The conditions for measuring BP are important:

*if there is asymmetry in blood pressure, the BP should be measured on the side with the higher BP;
*measurement in the surgery should look for orthostatic hypotension.
*Self-measurement of blood pressure is the gold standard and allows patients to be involved in their own management;
*ABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) is used to assess the blood pressure profile over 24 hours.

Sodium restriction to 100 mmol/d (6 g NaCl/d) improves BP control in patients with CKD. It can be monitored by measuring 24-hour natriuresis (1 g of salt intake corresponds to 17 mmol of urinary Na).

In conjunction with blood pressure control, strict control of proteinuria can slow the progression of CKD. An ACE inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) or, if intolerant, an angiotensin 2 AT1 receptor antagonist (ARB2) should be used as first-line treatment in diabetic patients '''as soon as albuminuria is ≥ 30 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinuria) and in non-diabetic patients as soon as albuminuria is ≥ 300 mg/24 h (or mg/g creatinuria corresponding approximately to proteinuria of 0.5 g/24 h).'''

In cases of proteinuria without hypertension :

*an ACE inhibitor or ARB2 should be used;
*the target is proteinuria < 0.5 g/g creatinine;
*with the maximum tolerated dose to ensure PAS remains > 110 mmHg.

IEC-ARA2 combinations are not recommended.

Therapeutic strategy depending on whether or not targets are reached

*Therapeutic targets are met: continue treatment and monitoring. In the event of specific side-effects of ACE inhibitors, in particular a troublesome cough, replace the ACE inhibitor with an ARB2.
*If BP > target 130/80 mmHg: check compliance with treatment and sodium restriction (24-hour natriuresis). If necessary, a thiazide diuretic (if GFR > 30 ml/min) or loop diuretic (if GFR ≤ 30 ml/min) may be prescribed in addition to ACE inhibitors. If this fails, another therapeutic class (β-blocker or calcium blocker) should be combined and specialist nephrological advice sought.
*If proteinuria > 0.5 g/d or 500 mg/g creatinuria: gradually increase the dosage of the ACE inhibitor or ARB2 prescribed (up to the maximum dose authorised by the marketing authorisation) provided that it is clinically (PAS > 110 mmHg) and biologically well tolerated.
