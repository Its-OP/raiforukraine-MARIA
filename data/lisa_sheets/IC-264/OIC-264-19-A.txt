In CKD, disorders of phosphocalcic and bone metabolism are characterised by :

*a [[Dyscalcaemia SD-200|hypocalcaemia]] ;
*hyperphosphataemia, linked to reduced renal excretion of phosphates;
*Active vitamin D deficiency secondary to reduced renal 1-Î± hydroxylase activity;
*early secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterised by an increase in parathyroid hormone.

'''Two major types of bone lesions may be associated to varying degrees:''''

*osteomalacia (reduced bone formation) secondary to vitamin D deficiency:

#Rare clinical sign,
#radiological signs: demineralisation, late Looser-Milkman striae,
#biological signs: decrease in the concentration of 1,25 (OH)2- vitamin D3, which is not measured in practice. Only native vitamin D deficiency assessed by measuring 25 OH vitamin D3 should be corrected;

*fibrous osteitis (accelerated bone destruction) secondary to hyperparathyroidism:

#Clinical signs: bone pain, late pathological fractures,
#radiological signs: resorption of bone ends (phalanges and clavicles), gaps in finger phalanges, demineralisation,
#Biological signs: increased parathormone concentration.

'''Prevention and treatment of phosphocalcic disorders before stage 5:'''

Early prevention requires :

*Natural vitamin D3 supplementation in cases of documented deficiency,
*Calcium intake (between 1 and 2.5 g/day of elemental calcium),
*Restriction of dietary phosphorus intake, thanks to specialised management.

The treatment objectives are :

*normal blood calcium levels,
*phosphate levels below 1.5 mmol/L,
*sub-normal PTH before dialysis.
