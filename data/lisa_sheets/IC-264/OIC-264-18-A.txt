The vascular risk in CKD is much higher than in the general population:

* ischaemic heart disease (myocardial infarction 3 times more frequent than in the general population);
* cerebrovascular accident;
* arteriopathy of the lower limbs...

The cardiovascular consequences of CKD are :

1. arterial hypertension

* It occurs early and frequently.
* It is one of the major factors in the progression of CKD.
* It is essentially volume-dependent, justifying a low-salt diet and the use of diuretics for hypertension in CKD.

'''2. Accelerated arterial damage: atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis''''

Various factors contribute to the development of these lesions in CKD patients:

* Common vascular risk factors: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, diabetes, age;
* factors specific to CKD: disorders of phosphocalcic metabolism (mediacalcosis), hyperhomocysteinemia, anaemia, insulin resistance, uraemic toxins.

'''3. Cardiac damage''

Cardiac disorders include :

* left ventricular hypertrophy secondary essentially to hypertension and anaemia;
* valvular and coronary calcifications;
* uraemic heart disease of multifactorial aetiology (ischaemia, uraemic toxins, etc.).
