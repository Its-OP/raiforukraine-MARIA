The initiation of treatment with a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitor or ARB2) requires precautions to avoid :

*hypotension or acute renal failure on initiation of treatment or when doses are increased, especially in cases of hypovolaemia;
*hyperkalaemia, especially in diabetics or patients with CKD.

'''What to do'''

* Reduce diuretic doses if necessary, and avoid introducing an ACE inhibitor or ARB2 after acute sodium depletion (treatment of acute pulmonary oedema).
* Start with a low dose and gradually increase in stages over 2 to 4 weeks, especially in elderly patients with impaired renal function. Doses should be increased until therapeutic targets or the maximum MA doses are reached.
* Creatinine and potassium levels should be measured before prescription, then 1 to 2 weeks after the start of treatment, and after any change in dosage, due to the risk of a reversible decline in renal function with ACE inhibitors or ARBs2 :
*# A 10-20% increase in serum creatinine ''indicates the efficacy of treatment'' and does not justify a reduction in dosage,
*#in the event of an increase in creatinine of more than 30%, temporarily stop the ACE inhibitor or ARB2, which may be reintroduced gradually, after ruling out renal artery stenosis, and after reducing the dose of diuretics,
*#Temporary discontinuation of treatment is envisaged for hyperkalaemia above 6 mmol/L. For kalaemia between 5 and 6 mmol/L, a dietary imbalance should be investigated and a diuretic treatment with hypokalaemia or a resin preventing the absorption of dietary potassium may be started.
* To avoid severe functional renal failure, patients should be instructed to stop taking ACE inhibitors or ARB2 and diuretics if there is a risk of acute extracellular dehydration (heatwave, viral gastroenteritis).
