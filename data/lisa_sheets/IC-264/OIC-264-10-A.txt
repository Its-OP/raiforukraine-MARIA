All causes of neglected chronic obstruction can lead to CKD. The later the obstruction is removed, the more incomplete the recovery of renal function will be.

Clinical examination (bladder globe, large kidneys and pelvic touch-ups if necessary) and ultrasound examination of the urinary tract (dilatation of the pyelocalic cavities, post-micturition residue) are essential for management, as well as for any deterioration.
