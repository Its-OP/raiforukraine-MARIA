====Sexual health prevention====
Screening for and prevention of STIs including HIV, use of male and female condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP), vaccination (against HBV).

====If you return to your country of origin (e.g. on holiday) ====
Anti-malarial prophylaxis and prevention of malaria (impregnated mosquito net) as there is no lasting immunity.

Do not bathe in freshwater at sites known to transmit bilharziasis

====In the event of immunosuppressive treatment====
Systematic Ivermectin for the prevention of disseminated anguillulosis in any patient who has lived in a tropical zone before starting treatment.

====Vaccinations ([[2C-174-PC-B01]])====

====Cancer====
The epidemiology of cancers is specific to the country of origin. In countries with limited resources, cancers caused by infectious agents are much more common: HBV-HCV for the liver, HPV for the cervix, H. pylori for the stomach and schistosomiasis for the urinary tract. Screening should be stepped up.
