'''Étranger''': a person who does not have French nationality, a term used by the police and legal authorities.

'''Immigré''': a person born abroad in a foreign country and now living in France. A person remains an immigrant even if they acquire French nationality. There are therefore 2 administrative categories of immigrant: foreign and French.

'''Migrant''': in the sense of international migrant, a person who has lived abroad and now resides in France. Migrants born outside France are immigrants, whether French by birth or immigrants.

The majority of migrants live in 3 regions: Ile de France, Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne, PACA
