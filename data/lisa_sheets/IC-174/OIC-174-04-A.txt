==== for French nationals and legally resident foreign nationals====
You can join the health insurance scheme by working or living in a stable and regular place of residence in order to benefit from PUMA (universal health protection) and C2S (supplementary health insurance, formerly known as CMU complémentaire, means-tested).

==== for illegal residents====
If you have been in France for at least 3 months and your income is below the ceiling set by the health insurance scheme, you must apply for AME (Aide Médicale d'Etat).

In the event of a medical emergency, the DSUV (arrangements for urgent and vital care) can be used for illegal immigrants who have been in the country for less than 3 months or are unable to prove their identity and residence.

For foreign nationals who have entered the country illegally, entitlement may be maintained for one year following the start of their legal stay. This is generally followed by AME if the illegal status persists.

====Access to healthcare====
In the absence of PUMA or AME, the PASS (permanence d'accès aux soins de santé - health care access centres) are a free resource for care and social support.

====Other centres offering free healthcare:====
CeGIDD (free information, screening and diagnosis centres)

Vaccination centres

PMI (mother and child protection)

CPEF (family planning and education centre)

CLAT (tuberculosis treatment centre)
