'''Every employer''' (public or private) with at least one employee must organise or join an occupational health and prevention service (SPST).

2 modes of organisation for STPS:

*Either a department shared by several companies = an inter-company OHS department
*Or an internal department within the company in the case of a large company = autonomous OHS.


STPSs are organised into ''multidisciplinary teams'' comprising :

*nurses
*occupational risk specialists such as ergonomists, engineers and psychologists,
*and led by the occupational physician.

The two main missions of the STPS are :

*advice to employees and employers on the assessment and management of occupational risks, and
*and employee health monitoring.

They also have a "health promotion" role.
