=== '''Important: the proposed measures must always be in the following order:'' ===

* '''step 1,'''
* '''then if impossible step 2'''
* '''then ...'''

=== 1. '''Eliminate hazards''', ===
eliminating the use of hazardous chemicals, redesigning premises to avoid the risk of falls, etc. changing work processes

Sometimes it is impossible to eliminate the danger: for example, wood dust is a carcinogen, but we cannot suggest to a woodworker that he stop using wood ....=> step 2
<br />

=== 2. '''Limit emissions at source''' and thus limit their dispersion in the workplace by means of collective protective equipment: ===
Examples: working in an enclosed space, extraction of emissions, installation of an extractor hood when using solvents, enclosure of a noisy machine, organisation of work to reduce the number of people in the room, ....

In the case of wood dust: dust extraction at source

If you have to do a lot of dusty jobs and the suction is inadequate => step 3
<br />

=== 3. '''Limit employee exposure''' by wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (gloves, breathing masks, goggles, ear muffs, etc.). ===
Example in the case of wood dust: wear a respiratory protection mask that has been chosen to be suitable (not all masks are equally useful or effective...) and sufficiently comfortable to wear.


=== 4. '''Evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures'': ===
monitoring exposure levels by environmental metrology (atmospheric for chemicals, noise for noise, etc.) and biological exposure monitoring (urinary solvents, blood lead, etc.).
