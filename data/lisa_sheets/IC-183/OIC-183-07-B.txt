Hi√©rachisation des risques professionnels is ''obligatoire'' in companies and ''under the responsibility of the employer'', but the multidisciplinary occupational health team and the occupational physician must contribute to it.

===3 steps===

====1.      Hazard identification and characterisation:====

*knowledge of workstations
*knowledge of product composition (safety data sheets)

====2.      Exposure assessment:====

*ambient and individual measurements: e.g. noise metrology
*measurements of biological indicators of exposure (toxins or metabolites measured in the biological media of exposed subjects).
*ergonomic studies of workstations

====3.      Estimated risks:====

*Comparison of measured exposures with exposure limit values that must not be exceeded to protect health.
*Limit values: based on dose-response relationships published in the literature, exist for a large number of dangerous chemical agents, asbestos, noise and ionising radiation....


Must be followed by a ''prevention plan'' formalising the ''risk management approach''.
