===''Primary prevention:'''===

*Aims to prevent the appearance of deleterious effects in employees exposed to occupational risks,
*Concerns all types of risk,
*It is a "collective technique" (e.g. machine enclosures to reduce noise),
*Then "individual technical" (e.g. providing earplugs to protect against noise),
*It can be ''medical'': vaccination for example.

===''Secondary prevention'''===

*Aims to ''detect'' pathologies linked to the occupational risk concerned as early as possible,
*Mainly medical.
*For example: audiograms.

===''Tertiary prevention'''===

*Aims to ''keep people in work'' with work-related illnesses,
*Technical/organisational: adapting the workstation (accessibility, working hours),
*Medical: medical treatment to prevent the condition or disability from worsening.
