== Principles of aetiological assessment
Look for the most frequent or most serious aetiologies.

Always rule out non-psychiatric causes before suggesting a psychiatric aetiology.

Agitation can occur in all psychiatric disorders.

The diagnostic approach is the same for patients with or without a psychiatric history.
