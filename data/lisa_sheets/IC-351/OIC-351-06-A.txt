== Interviewing the patient and next of kin ==

=== Context of onset ===
duration, mode of onset (sudden or gradual), permanent or fluctuating course, time of day, triggering factors

=== History ===
Psychiatric and non-psychiatric history, use of psychoactive substances, treatment or recent change in treatment

== Clinical examination

=== Search for signs of seriousness (vital prognosis): ===

* Vitals: temperature, blood pressure, heart rate
* Confusion: acute and transient disturbance of attention, cognition and consciousness, manifested by temporo-spatial disorientation, disturbances of memory, speech, perceptions and behaviour. Onset is generally abrupt and the course fluctuates. Main aetiologies: non-psychiatric pathologies, intoxication or withdrawal of a psychoactive substance, iatrogeny.
* Severe dehydration (hydro-electrolytic disorders)
* Sepsis: cardiovascular shock, acute respiratory distress, cyanosis.

=== Non-psychiatric signs ===

* Neurological examination: miosis, mydriasis, meningeal syndrome, focal signs, tongue biting, etc.
* General examination to look for a metabolic, hydro-electrolytic or endocrine aetiology: dehydration, tachycardia, urinary globe, etc.
* General examination to look for an infectious aetiology: hyperthermia, meningeal syndrome, dyspnoea, cyanosis, sweating, etc.

=== Psychiatric signs ===

* Depressive and manic symptoms
* Psychotic symptoms
* Anxiety symptoms

== Paraclinical examinations
A minimum blood test is systematically carried out; it will be combined with additional tests depending on the anamnesis and the points raised during questioning and clinical examination (see corresponding knowledge objective).
