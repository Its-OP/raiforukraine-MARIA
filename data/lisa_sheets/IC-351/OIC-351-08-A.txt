A hallucinatory syndrome may affect one or more of the senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. A distinction is made between :

* Visual hallucinations (should initially point to a non-psychiatric aetiology)
* Auditory hallucinations, often acoustic/verbal: long or close, hostile or benevolent voices, conversing with each other, addressing the patient or commenting on his or her actions, from one or more people, known or unknown. Listening attitudes, means of protection (headphones, cotton wool in the ears, etc.), soliloquy and changes in emotional state may be observed.
* Taste hallucinations
* olfactory hallucinations
* Tactile hallucinations: which can lead to reactions such as scratching, washing, etc.
* Cenesthetic hallucinations: visceral somatic sensations, deep inner sensitivity, etc.
* Kinesthetic hallucinations: the patient utters words that they do not recognise as their own.
