There is no a priori evidence to suggest a psychiatric cause for any patient who may present with such an acute condition for non-psychiatric reasons. The following factors should make you fear a non-psychiatric aetiology. Once you have ruled them out, you can consider a psychiatric aetiology.

* Confusional syndrome
* Physical signs of dehydration
* Physical signs of infection
* Signs of cardiovascular or respiratory failure
* Urinary incontinence, faecal impaction
* abnormalities identified on neurological examination and general physical examination
