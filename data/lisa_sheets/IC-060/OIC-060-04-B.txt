It is estimated that psychiatric disorders account for 21 to 32% of years lived with disability (YLDs) and 7 to 13% of DALYs (years of life lost due to premature mortality or disability, a reflection of life expectancy in good health).

The relative risk of mortality for patients with a psychiatric disorder is 2.2 compared with those without. 67% of deaths are due to natural causes and 17% to suicide or accident.

Worldwide, 14% of deaths (8 million each year) are attributable to psychiatric disorders.

Cumulative risk of death by suicide :

- Any psychiatric disorder: 4.3% of men and 2.1% of women

- Schizophrenia: 6.6% of men and 4.9% of women

- Bipolar disorder: 7.8% of men and 4.8% of women

- Unipolar depression: 6.7% of men and 4.8% of women

- Substance use disorder: 4.7% of men and 3.3% of women

Among patients with a psychiatric disorder, only 55% have only one, 22% have two and 23% have at least three.
