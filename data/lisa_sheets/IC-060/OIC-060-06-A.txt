Disease risk: Incidence of a disease in a given population over a given period of time, probability of the disease occurring.

Risk factor: Factor which modifies the level of risk, which is statistically associated with the occurrence of the disease. A risk factor is not necessarily causal, i.e. responsible for the disease.

Vulnerability: exposure to one or more risk factors for the disease makes a person or group vulnerable to the disease. Vulnerability is common in the population, but only a small proportion of these vulnerable people will develop the disease.

Stress factors: changes in the person's biopsychosocial environment that require them to adapt (life event, change in pace of life, change in lifestyle....).
