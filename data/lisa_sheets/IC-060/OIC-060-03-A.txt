Psychiatric disorders reduce life expectancy by around 16 years in men and 13 years in women. This early mortality is mainly cardiovascular and respiratory.

The causes are addictive co-morbidities (tobacco, alcohol, other substances), lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, diet), the frequency of non-psychiatric co-morbidities (30-60% of patients) and a lack of demand for care, screening and access to care due to stigmatisation.

Early mortality is also explained by an increased risk of death by suicide.

Opiate use disorders are associated with significant excess mortality among users (55% of years of life lost and 44% of years of life lost due to disability).
