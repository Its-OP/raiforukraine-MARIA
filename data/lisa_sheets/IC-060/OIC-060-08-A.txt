== Prevention

=== WHO definition, 1948: All measures aimed at avoiding or reducing the number and severity of diseases, accidents and handicaps ===

== Clinical approach to prevention

=== Primary prevention ===
All actions aimed at reducing the incidence of a disease in a population and reducing risks. The aim is to combat risk factors and educate the population about health behaviour.

=== Secondary prevention ===
Seeking to reduce the prevalence of a disease in a population. It covers actions taken at the very beginning of the onset of the disease to eliminate risk factors in the latency phase: screening, early diagnosis and treatment.

=== Tertiary prevention ===
The aim is to reduce mortality, chronic disability or relapses in a population and the complications, disabilities or relapses resulting from the disease (reintegration, compensation, avoiding relapses and recurrences).

== Population-based approach to prevention ==

=== Universal prevention: for everyone ===
Preventive action that concerns the entire population.

=== Selective prevention ===
Preventive action aimed at specific population sub-groups at high risk of the disorder. The targeted characteristics are those of the group.

=== Indicated prevention ===
Preventive action aimed at specific population sub-groups with risk factors or manifestations related to the problem. The characteristics targeted and assessed are those of the individuals.
