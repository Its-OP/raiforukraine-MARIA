The aetiological model of psychiatric disorders is multifactorial. The emergence of these disorders results from interactions between genetic and environmental risk and protective factors. There is an interaction between a biological/genetic vulnerability and a pathogenic environment. A dynamic set of genetic and environmental factors influence both vulnerability to disease and the clinical expression of disease throughout development.

A genetic risk factor is a genetic variation (one or a combination of several unique genetic polymorphisms) responsible for a genetic predisposition.

An environmental factor is a non-genetic predisposing factor that surrounds the genes (biological, social factors, etc.).
