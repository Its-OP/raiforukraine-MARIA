Evaluation of the tonsillar filling when the mouth is opened using the modified Mallampati score: class 1: the uvula and tonsillar lodges are visible; class 2: the uvula is partially visible; class 3: the membranous palate is visible; class 4: only the bony palate is visible.


Tonsil volume is determined by Friedman's grades: grade 0: the uvula and pillars of the tonsil compartment are visible; grade 1: the tonsils are hidden in the compartment; grade 2: the tonsils extend beyond the compartment; grade 3: the tonsils extend well beyond the compartment without passing through the middle; grade 4: the tonsils are joined at the level of the uvula.




Swallowing problems (dysphagia with large pieces).

Difficulties with phonation (oropharyngeal voice).

Sometimes associated with orofacial development disorders and/or orthodontic problems.
