The choice of treatment will depend on the results of the polysomnography. A minimum duration of 4 hours is required for the test to be valid. The apnoea and hypopnoea index (AHI) is the number of respiratory events per hour of sleep. This index will guide management:

- between 5 and 15: mild SAS, no treatment necessary, except in cases of discordance with the clinic and the presence of co-morbidities: an additional examination should then be considered.

- Between 15 and 30: moderate SAS: treatment to be considered depending on the clinical situation, and in the event of cardiovascular or metabolic co-morbidities.

- >30: severe SAS, treatment is indicated immediately.

The standard treatment is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This is reimbursed by the health insurance scheme in cases of AHI>30, or moderate SAS, documented by polysomnography, with comorbidities. It may be the subject of an ALD in the event of comorbidities.

In younger patients, particularly those with facial dysmorphia, maxillofacial surgery may be recommended.

The mandibular advancement orthosis is a treatment option to be proposed in the event of difficulties with CPAP, or in the event of moderate SAS.

Finally, in the case of positional apnoeas, when apnoeas predominate in the dorsal position, a simple positional treatment, with a tennis ball placed on the back every night, may be a therapeutic solution.
