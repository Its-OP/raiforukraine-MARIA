Partial or total interruption of breathing (hypopnoea or apnoea) during sleep. It may be linked to obstruction of the upper airways or, more rarely, to a defect in the central control of breathing. Clinically, it is evoked by: excessive daytime sleepiness, associated with at least 2 of the following criteria

- Severe daily snoring

- Sensations of choking or suffocation during sleep

- Repeated awakenings during sleep

- Unrefreshing sleep

- Daytime fatigue

- Difficulty concentrating

- Nocturia

and polysomnographic recording of at least 5 episodes of apnoea or hypopnoea per hour.

Pathophysiologically, apnoea causes nocturnal micro-arousals, which allow breathing to resume, but which fragment sleep and limit periods of deep sleep.
