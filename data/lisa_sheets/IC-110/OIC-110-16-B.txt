There are occupational risks associated with sleep apnoea, which can have major repercussions on work, on the safety of the patient himself and also on that of others, because at the wheel of a vehicle, SAS increases the probability of an accident by a factor of six. Night work, shift work and driving vehicles or machinery are strongly discouraged for people with this syndrome.

The repeated occurrence of the need to sleep during the day linked to SAS will be taken into account when considering suitability for certain jobs, such as driving vehicles or machinery or any other high-risk position.

This diagnosis should therefore lead the doctor to warn the patient that he is unfit to drive until his syndrome returns to normal under treatment.

The Order of 18 December 2015 lists the conditions that are incompatible with obtaining or maintaining a driving licence. It specifies that, depending on the pathology, 2 weeks to 1 month of effective treatment is required before driving a light group vehicle again. Driving licences are issued for a maximum of 3 years.

In the event of unfitness for work issued by the occupational physician, driving may be resumed 2 weeks to 1 month after assessment of the therapeutic effectiveness of the appropriate treatment.
