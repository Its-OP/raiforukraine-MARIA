'''Anamnesis:'''

The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is widely used and validated in the assessment of sleep apnoea in particular. It consists of 8 questions assessing the risk of falling asleep in everyday situations. Thresholds are used to define normal, doubtful or pathological sleepiness.

The Berlin questionnaire can be used to identify patients with a sleep apnoea-hypopnoea index >5, with a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 77%, although it performs less well in elderly patients.

'''Clinical examination:'''

BMI, BP, SaO2 measurement, cardiopulmonary examination and ENT examination are carried out, looking for obstacles to airflow: nasal obstruction, thick tongue (Mallampati score), facial morphology, particularly in the case of retrognathism.

'''Additional examinations:'''

The reference test is polysomnography, which can be carried out in hospital or on an outpatient basis.

A simpler outpatient examination, nocturnal ventilatory polygraphy (which records only breathing during sleep), is sufficient in the majority of cases. Polysomnography, which provides information on sleep architecture, should be considered as a complement, or if other sleep pathologies are suspected.

EFR with arterial gasometry may be useful if the patient is a smoker and/or suffers from dyspnoea on exertion.

Airway imaging is generally unnecessary.
