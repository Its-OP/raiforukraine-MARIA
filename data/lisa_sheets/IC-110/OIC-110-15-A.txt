Sleep fragmentation, as well as intrathoracic pressure abnormalities, are responsible for the cardiovascular and metabolic consequences of SAS: it is a risk factor for hypertension (80% of resistant hypertension), cardiac arrhythmia and coronary insufficiency (50% of patients with cardiac insufficiency), stroke (x2 to 3 times), and diabetes (30% of diabetic patients).

In terms of metabolism, 30% of obese people (and 77% of morbidly obese patients) have an AS. 70% of SAS patients are overweight.

Prevalence increases with age (peaking between the ages of 50 and 70).

It may be associated with abnormalities of the upper airways:

- retrognathia, micromandibulia

- tonsillar hypertrophy

- macroglossia associated with acromegaly and hypothyroidism

It is predominantly male, but at the menopause women are at the same risk as men.
