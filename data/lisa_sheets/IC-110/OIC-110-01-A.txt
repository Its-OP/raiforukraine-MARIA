A distinction is made between slow wave sleep and REM sleep.

1- Slow wave sleep is organised into 3 stages in the same order after each period of wakefulness and characterised by specific EEG elements:

- Stage 1: the individual can still be aware of their environment, slow eye movements; theta (rapid) EEG activity

- Stage 2: light sleep, theta EEG activity + specific grapho-elements

- Stage 3: the individual is no longer aware of their environment, slow synchronised EEG activity of large delta amplitude,


2- REM sleep: rapid eye movements, muscle atonia, rapid desynchronised EEG activity close to the waking state (dream stage).


This succession defines a sleep cycle lasting 90 minutes. There are three to five sleep cycles in a single night. These cycles are separated by physiological nocturnal awakenings, generally lasting less than 10 minutes. These arousals tend to increase with age and become more conscious.
