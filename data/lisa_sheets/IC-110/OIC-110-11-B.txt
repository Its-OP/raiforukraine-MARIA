''Excessive daytime sleepiness'' (EDS) is a subjective and objective state of lowered physiological wakefulness and abnormal propensity to sleep or doze off.

It is suggested in cases of involuntary, irresistible falling asleep in various everyday situations (conversation, activity, driving), a need to fight off sleep, accidents linked to drowsiness (at the wheel).

EDS should be distinguished from fatigue (which recovers with rest) and apathy (lack of motivation).

EDS can be induced by chronic behavioural sleep deprivation or a disorder of the sleep-wake circadian rhythm (phase advance or delay, night or shift work), or by sedative or toxic drugs or alcohol. It may also be the symptom of an organic pathology (SAS, restless legs syndrome, narcolepsy), psychiatric pathology (depression) or, rarely, be linked to idiopathic hypersomnia.

EDS is one of the medical conditions that are incompatible with obtaining or maintaining a driving licence, or that may result in the issue of a driving licence with limited validity.
