* A rapid worsening of these symptoms over a few days, or even a few hours, requires emergency hospitalisation in an intensive care unit. If symptoms are rapid and severe at home, the Centre 15 should be called.
* A stomach tube and emergency intubation are sometimes necessary.
* Two types of treatment are useful in severe relapses, with similar efficacy:

- polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG)

- plasma exchange

* These treatments should always be combined with a background treatment, because of their transient effect.
