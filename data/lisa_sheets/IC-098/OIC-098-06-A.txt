* Acute attacks of myasthenia (myasthenic crisis) may occur spontaneously or be triggered by contraindicated medication, infection, surgery or post-partum.
* The major signs of seriousness are congestion, shortness of breath at the slightest effort with orthopnoea ([[Dyspnoea SD-162|Dyspnoea]]), ineffective cough ([[Cough SD-167|Cough]]), false routes ([[Swallowing disorders or false route SD-062|Swallowing disorders or false route]]) and/or muscular weakness becoming very marked ([[Muscular weakness SD-074|Muscular weakness]] ; [Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]).
* Rapid motor and respiratory deterioration ([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]]) may also occur during the cholinergic crisis, which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the myasthenic crisis:

- It is due to an overdose of anticholinesterase drugs ([[Suspicion of an Adverse Drug Reaction or an SD-348|Suspicion of an Adverse Drug Reaction or an SD-348|Suspicion of an Adverse Drug Reaction or an SD-348|Suspicion of an Adverse Drug Reaction or an SD-348|Suspicion of an Adverse Drug Reaction]]).

- It is characterised by the presence of signs of cholinergic overdose: diffuse fasciculations, cramps ([[Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias SD-073|Pain, burning, cramps and paresthesias]]), digestive signs (nausea, vomiting ([[Vomiting SD-013|Vomiting]]), diarrhoea ([[Diarrhoea SD-002|Diarrhoea]])), miosis, bradycardia ([[Bradycardia SD-159|Bradycardia]])

* The two complications can interact.

- Transfer to intensive care is essential
