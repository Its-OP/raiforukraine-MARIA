=== 1- Pure ocular myasthenia and generalised myasthenia ===
In 50% of cases, the initial symptoms are purely ocular. In 10 to 15% of patients, the disease remains localised to the ocular muscles after 2 years (visual abnormalities; diplopia; palpebral abnormalities), and is then referred to as ocular myasthenia, although in rare cases generalisation may occur later (generalised myasthenia).

Ocular myasthenia cannot therefore be diagnosed until 2 years after the first signs. The characteristics of ocular myasthenia are as follows:

* Predominantly male
* Most often occurs after the age of 40
* Thymoma is rare
* Neuromuscular block is frequently absent on ENMG (because it is found on extraocular nerve-muscle pairs).
* Anti-RACh antibodies are absent in half the cases.
* Poor response to anticholinesterase treatment.
* These forms of myasthenia essentially pose a functional problem.

=== 2- Forms with anti-MuSK (''Muscle Specific Kinase)'' ===

* Predominantly female, and most often generalised forms.
* Bulbar involvement more frequent than in other forms, with atrophy of the tongue (difficulty swallowing or false swallowing).
* Frequency of myasthenic attacks with frequent respiratory involvement (dyspnoea; acute respiratory distress).
* No thymoma
* ENMG exploration is frequently negative.
* Poor response to anticholinesterase drugs
* Plasma exchange is often more effective than IVIg.
* Very high efficacy of anti-CD20 (Rituximab)
