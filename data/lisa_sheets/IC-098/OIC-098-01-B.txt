Myasthenia (or ''myasthenia gravis''): is an autoimmune disease linked to a blockage of receptors on the motor plate by anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies or other types of antibody, leading to dysfunction of neuromuscular transmission: this is a post-synaptic block.

The thymus plays an important role: the acetylcholine receptors on the myoid cells of the thymus stimulate antibodies against the receptors on the neuromuscular junction; the thymus is a source of T helper lymphocytes which stimulate the production of these antibodies by B lymphocytes.

It can occur at any age, but most often affects adults.

Between the ages of 20 and 40, myasthenia gravis is more common in women, whereas it is more common in men over the age of 60.
