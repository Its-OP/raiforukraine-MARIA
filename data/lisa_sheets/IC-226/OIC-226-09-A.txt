=== '''High-risk PE (severe PE)''' ===
- PE associated with haemodynamic failure defined by a systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or a fall in SBP ≥ 40 mmHg for more than 15 minutes in the absence of another cause such as sepsis, arrhythmia or hypovolaemia.

- Absolute life-threatening emergency with a mortality risk of > 30%.

=== ''Non-high risk PE'' ===
Stratification of intermediate or high risk is based on a combination of the sPESI or HESTIA score and markers (imaging or biomarkers) of cardiac dysfunction.

Outpatient" management (in practice short hospitalisation or care pathway) may be proposed in cases of PE with a low risk of mortality (sPESI score = 0 and no cardiac repercussions).  

Patients with high intermediate severity PE should initially be monitored closely, ideally in intensive care units.
