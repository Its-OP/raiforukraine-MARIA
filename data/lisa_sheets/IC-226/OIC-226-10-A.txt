In cases of high clinical probability (DVT, PE), anticoagulant treatment is started before diagnostic confirmation by imaging.

== Outpatient/hospital management of VTE ==

=== '''DVT''' ===
Except in special cases, patients with DVT are treated on an outpatient basis.

Hospitalisation is recommended for patients :

*severe renal failure (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min);
*or with a pathology at risk of haemorrhage;
*or in a psychosocial, geographical or medical environment that does not allow optimal management at home;
*or in cases of proximal DVT with severe obstructive syndrome or ilio-caval localisation;
*or in cases of phlegmatia cœrulea (ischaemic DVT);
*or in cases of DVT occurring despite a well-managed anticoagulant treatment;
*or in cases of DVT associated with a non-low-risk pulmonary embolism.

In all cases, bed rest is not indicated.

=== '''PE''' ===
In the case of non-severe PE, it is essential to assess its "severity" in order to determine the place of initial management and the choice of anticoagulant treatment.

==Anticoagulant treatment ==
Therapeutic or curative doses of anticoagulants are the mainstay of treatment for VTE. ([[Heparins]] and [[Oral anticoagulants (VKAs and OADs)]]).

''''' Choice of anticoagulant treatment and available treatment regimens'''''

*Direct oral anticoagulants (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban)''''
**Recommended as first-line treatment except for high-risk or high-intermediate PE.
**prescribed immediately (without heparin phase).  
**Main contraindications: severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min according to Cockcroft), pregnancy, breast-feeding, drug interactions (Cyt 3A4 or PgP).
**May be used in certain cancer patients.
*''Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) / fondaparinux - VKA relay.'''
**Not recommended as a first-line strategy, but offered if contraindication to VKAs.
**VKA treatment is started on the first day of treatment.
**Parenteral treatment (LMWH / fondaparinux) is prescribed at a curative dose for at least 5 days (no monitoring) and then discontinued once 2 INR > 2 have been achieved at least 24 hours apart.
*Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
**reserved for severe PE and the treatment of MVTE in patients with renal insufficiency and a urine clearance of less than 15 mL/min.
**initial dose of 80 IU/kg
**initial dose of UFH is 18 IU/kg/hour
**daily monitoring of anti-Xa activity (ideally) and at each dose change (target 0.3 - 0.6 U/ml).
**Platelet count monitored twice weekly for the first 2 weeks of treatment.
**VKA relay must be carried out according to the same procedures as for LMWH/Fondaparinux.
**The relay may also be taken with an AOD.
*LMWH without VKA relay. This regimen is proposed for
**patients with cancer, particularly digestive cancer or certain urogenital cancers
**patients with a high risk of haemorrhage
**pregnant women:
***Only heparins, in practice LMWH, may be used throughout pregnancy.
***If VTE occurs during pregnancy, a minimum of 3 months' anticoagulant treatment is required, including the first 6 weeks post-partum (a period of high thrombotic risk).
***If breast-feeding, LMWH or warfarin may be used.
***AODs are contraindicated. Fondaparinux is not recommended.
