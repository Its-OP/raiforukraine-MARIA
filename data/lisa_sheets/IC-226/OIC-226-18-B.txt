The diagnosis of ''superficial venous thrombosis (SVD)'' is based on the clinical features: indurated venous cord with associated local inflammation.

A venous Doppler ultrasound of the lower limbs should be performed for

- confirm the diagnosis,

- estimate the extent of TVS in the lower limb

- exclude frequently associated DVT.

Treatment of DVT of the lower limb is based on

- elastic compression

- combined with anticoagulant treatment for 6 weeks with fondaparinux 2.5 mg 1 subcutaneous injection per day [prophylactic (preventive) dose].

If the end of the DVT is close to the deep venous network or if the DVT extends into the deep venous network, the anticoagulant treatment is that of a DVT administered at a therapeutic (curative) dose.

When DVT occurs in varicose veins, treatment of the varicose veins should be discussed at a distance from the thrombotic episode.
