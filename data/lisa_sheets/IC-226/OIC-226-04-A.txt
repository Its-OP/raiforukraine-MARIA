Thromboembolic venous disease (TEVD) is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency, as it can be life-threatening in the case of PE.

==Clinical suspicion: clinical signs ==
The clinical presentation of VTE is polymorphous.

'''Suspicion of DVT:''''

*Pain in the lower limb|Spontaneous pain in the lower limb;
*Localised or generalised oedema of the lower limbs|unilateral oedema]];
*Chronic venous insufficiency. Varicose veins|superficial venous dilatation in the absence of varicose veins]].

The more abrupt the onset and the more unilateral the signs, the more valuable they are.

DVT may also be asymptomatic and be discovered in the setting of PE or during routine screening.

'''Suspicion of PE:''''

*Chest pain SD-161|basi- or latero-thoracic pain;
*Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]];
*haemoptoic sputum ;
*Tachycardia SD-166|tachycardia];
*lipothymia ;
*Syncope;
*haemodynamic failure with signs of shock and right heart.
*

As in the case of DVT, these signs are not always present and may be encountered in other clinical situations.

Dyspnoea is all the more suggestive if there is no other obvious cause (pneumopathy, OAP, etc.).

Finally, PE can be asymptomatic, discovered by chance on a chest scan prescribed for another indication.

==Clinical probability scores ==
There are several clinical probability scores, in particular the Wells DVT score for the diagnosis of DVT, and the Wells PE and Geneva scores for PE. They are divided into 2 (not probable / probable) or 3 (low / intermediate / high) probability classes. In particular, they are used to guide the performance of additional tests, D-dimers and imaging.
=='''D-dimer'''==
- Fibrin degradation products.  

- determination by ELISA or turbidimetric latex techniques

- elevated levels in situations other than VTE (elderly subjects, pregnancy, infection, inflammation, cancer, COPD, etc.)

- '''non-specific'''

- but have a ''high negative predictive value''.

==Imaging ==
DVT:'''' venous Doppler ultrasound performed in decubitus position.

'''EP:''' thoracic angioscanner.  

- Certain situations may require ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy.  

- If there is a contraindication to either of these tests, the diagnosis is made if there is a clinical probability of PE and evidence of proximal DVT on venous Doppler ultrasound.

In the case of a ''high clinical probability'' score

- start anticoagulant treatment before the results of imaging tests

- if the initial imaging is negative, further investigations should be carried out before completely ruling out the diagnosis of PE by performing a venous Doppler ultrasound or a ventilation/perfusion lung scan or a thoracic angioscanner which would not have been performed before considering stopping anticoagulant treatment.

==''Differential diagnoses'''==
Bilateral, comparative and exhaustive venous Doppler ultrasound can be used to identify differential diagnoses such as popliteal cyst rupture, intramuscular haematoma, muscle tear, etc.

Thoracic angioscanner can be used to diagnose thoracic pathologies that mimic PE (pneumopathy, bronchopulmonary cancer, etc).
