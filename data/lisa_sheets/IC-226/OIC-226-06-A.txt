D-dimer:

- fibrin degradation products.

- non-specific

- but high negative predictive value

# If they are below the diagnostic threshold, they enable the diagnosis of DVT or PE to be ruled out if the clinical probability is not high.
# The threshold is adjusted for age for the diagnosis of exclusion of non-severe PE: < 500 µg/L if the patient is under 50 years of age, < [age × 10] µg/L if the patient is over 50 years of age. Age adjustment does not apply to DVT diagnosis.
- Does not apply to severe or high-probability PE.
