Questioning, a thorough clinical examination of the patient and the results of routine biological tests (haemogram, liver function tests, etc.) are the first essential step in this assessment.

In addition to this check-up, men should have a PSA test and women should have a gynaecological check-up.

In the absence of clinical evidence, no further investigations are recommended, except in cases of recurrent VTE.

Patients must be up to date with the cancer screening procedures offered by the ODLC.
