In cases of DVT of the lower limbs, class 3 elastic compression is indicated. It allows :

- in the acute phase, to reduce oedema and pain.

- outside the acute phase, compression (mainly socks) can reduce post-thrombotic syndrome and is indicated for a minimum of 6 months, after which it should be reassessed

Elastic compression should not be used if the ankle systolic pressure index is < 0.60.
