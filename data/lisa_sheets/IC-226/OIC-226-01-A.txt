Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are the two main entities of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE).

Deep vein thrombosis

This is a partial or total venous obstruction caused by an endoluminal thrombus, which may be located throughout the venous tree, most often in the lower limbs.

In the lower limbs, DVT is :

- or ''proximal'' (popliteal and suprapopliteal),

- or "distal", i.e. sub-popliteal, involving the collecting trunks (posterior tibial, anterior tibial, fibular) or muscle veins (soleus, gastrocnemius).

'''Pulmonary embolism'''

PE occurs when a venous thrombus migrates into the pulmonary arteries.

'''High-risk PE (severe PE):''''

- PE associated with haemodynamic failure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mmHg or drop in SBP ≥ 40 mmHg for more than 15 minutes), in the absence of another cause such as sepsis, arrhythmia or hypovolaemia.

- mortality > 25%
