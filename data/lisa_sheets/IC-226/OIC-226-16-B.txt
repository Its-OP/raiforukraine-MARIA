Long-term complications include post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and post-embolic pulmonary hypertension (PH).

20-50% of DVTs will become complicated with TPS despite well-managed treatment (5-10% will develop severe TPS)

The risk is particularly high in cases of iliofemoral thrombosis.

The severity of TPS is assessed using the [[Post-thrombotic syndrome 2C-227-DE-A02|Villalta score]].

L''''HTP'''''occurs after severe PE or recurrent PE. It leads to heart failure (left and right) 2C-234-EP-B01|right heart failure ([[Performing and interpreting an electrocardiogram (ecg) SDD-185|SDD: performing and interpreting an electrocardiogram]]).
