'''Formation of atherosclerotic plaque:'''

- accumulation of lipoproteins in the intima throughout life (lipid striae),

- increase in the lipid component and appearance of oxidised LDL,

- recruitment of macrophages which gorge themselves on oxidised LDL,

- a change in the phenotype of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells, which migrate into the plaque and proliferate in an attempt to isolate all the inflammatory cells,

- growth of atherosclerotic plaque,

- remodelling of atherosclerotic plaque,

- progressive reduction in the circulating lumen of the artery.

'''Possible complications:'''

- Impaired downstream flow from a certain degree of plaque-related stenosis,

- thrombus formation on plaque ± distal embolism if plaque rupture,

- occurrence of intra-plate haemorrhage increasing the stenosis.
