Atheromatous disease is a systemic inflammatory disease. Preferential anatomical locations are the coronary arteries, the arteries destined for the brain (supra-aortic trunks), the aorta and the arteries of the lower limbs, the renal arteries and the digestive arteries. A patient is said to have polyatheromatous or polyvascular disease when at least 2 different anatomical sites are affected, whether or not the disease is symptomatic.
