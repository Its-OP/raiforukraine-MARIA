A decrease in food intake is, by definition, a reduction in food intake compared with the usual situation. When questioned, patients or those around them do not always mention a reduction in food intake.

''There is a drop in ingesta if there is a deficit between actual ingesta and estimated needs for a given individual''.

The ingesta can be :

- Calculated by a dietician in the course of a retrospective ''dietary survey'' of the previous day's or even the last 3 to 7 days' food intake. But this method is time-consuming.

- Estimated using a "visual or verbal analogue scale" (VAS) assessing the previous day's food intake (from zero to 10). This method can be used both at home and in hospital.

- Estimated in hospital or institutional settings on a ''semi-quantitative'' basis by the staff who clear the patient's meal trays (has eaten everything, has eaten more than half, needs to eat less than half, has eaten nothing from the tray or is fasting).


In cases of eating disorders, a reduction in food intake is sometimes fiercely denied. It is therefore necessary to check that there is no concealment of food or purgative action (vomiting in particular).
