Malabsorption and/or maldigestion are usually manifested by stools :

- Too frequent (>3/d) and/or "abundant" (>300 g/d),

- Soft or liquid and/or "fatty" consistency (clinical steatorrhea),

- Most often occurs in the context of digestive discomfort and abdominal pain.

Beyond these signs, it is the context that most often allows malabsorption and/or maldigestion to be evoked or suspected:

- Celiac disease, or gluten intolerance, is the most common medical cause of intestinal malabsorption. It manifests itself as abdominal pain and diarrhoea when gluten-containing foods are eaten, and improves when these are excluded.

- Crohn's disease. In severe cases, there may be associated loss of protein in the intestinal lumen (exudative enteropathy).

- Chronic diarrhoea (> 300g of stools per day for more than a month), whether infectious, tumour-related (particularly neuroendocrine tumours) or post-surgical after small bowel resection (''short small bowel syndrome'').

- Cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis and a history of pancreatic surgery can lead to fatty, loose or liquid stools,

- Obstruction of bile excretion due to lithiasis or tumours, leading to jaundice and discoloured stools.
