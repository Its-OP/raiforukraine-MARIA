'''Definition'''

Weight loss is weight loss. Weight loss reflects an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, and corresponds to a loss of intracellular mass, which may or may not be distributed evenly.


'''Differential diagnosis'''

Weight loss secondary to ''water movement'' (melting oedema of the lower limbs, ascites puncture, dehydration, etc.) or secondary to the removal of tissue (amputation, removal of a large tumour, etc.) or childbirth is not weight loss.

Weight loss must also be distinguished from thinness. You can be thin without having lost weight, and this is mainly the case with ''constitutional thinness'': weight is, and always has been, low and remains stable. However, the body mass index (BMI) is greater than 16. There are no significant physical pathological repercussions.
