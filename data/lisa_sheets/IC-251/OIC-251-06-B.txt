It is important to have an oeso-gastroduodenal fibroscopy with biopsies and an abdominal scan (pancreatic anomalies?). Secondly, enteroscan or MRI (suspected inflammatory disease of the small intestine: Crohn's disease).

Malabsorption is confirmed by measuring steatorrhea (> 7 g/24h).

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency was confirmed by a low faecal elastase assay.

A ''parasitological stool examination'' may be useful.

Alpha1-antitrypsin clearance is used to diagnose exudative enteropathy.


The usual biology (hypalbuminemia, reduced prothrombin rate, etc.) may be suggestive.
