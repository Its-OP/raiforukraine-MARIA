==='''Interrogatory: assessment and management of acute pain + [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SDD-260|chronic]]''''===

*'''characterise the pain''''
**seat: cervical/dorsal/lumbar spine '''[[Spinal pain (cervical, dorsal or lumbar) SDD-072|spinal pain (cervical, dorsal or lumbar)]]''''
**irradiations '''([[Cervico-facial pain SDD-144|cervico-facial pain]], [[Pelvic pain SDD-099|pelvic pain]], [[Testicular pain SDD-100|testicular pain]])'''''
**mode and circumstances of onset: trauma, micro-trauma, sedentary lifestyle, weight gain, accident at work, etc.
**impulse to cough or defecate
**mechanical or inflammatory schedule (waking up at night, waking up in the morning, worst time of the night and/or morning)
**aggravating factors: movement, physical activity/rest
**mitigating factors: physical activity/rest, kyphosis, NSAIDs, simple analgesics
**intensity: VAS, ENS
**progression: permanent, in attacks
**duration of evolution
**impact on activities and participation (daily life, leisure, work): questioning, self-questionnaire (Quebec, Dallas, Oswestry)
**associated signs: radiculalgia, vesico-sphincter disorders, saddle anaesthesia, vertigo, headaches, etc.
**effectiveness of previous and current treatments

*look for ''red flags'' (see below)
*look for other joint and extra-articular signs pointing to inflammatory disease: family or personal history of inflammatory rheumatism or autoimmune disease, peripheral arthralgia or arthritis, enthesitis (heel, pelvis), associated signs (diarrhoea, eye inflammation, psoriasis), etc.
*look for deconditioning during exercise ''[[Identify a situation of deconditioning SDD-353|(identify a situation of deconditioning during exercise)]]''''
*look for risk factors for chronicity of low back pain/common neck pain: psycho-social factors

<br />

===''Spinal examination''===

*measurement of height and loss of height compared to age 20
*on inspection:
**search for spinal deformity: in the frontal plane (lateral deformity), in the sagittal plane (hypo/hypercyphosis, hypo/hyperlordosis, anterior deformity) and in the axial plane (gibbosity) ''[[Spinal deformity SDD-065|(spinal deformity)]]''', asymmetry of positioning of the shoulders, shoulder blades, waist folds or pelvis
**search for an antalgic attitude with contracture or a scoliotic attitude
**to look for inequality in the length of the lower limbs
**search for gait disorder

*on palpation: look for pain in the spine, paravertebral or sacroiliac muscles, or a ringing sound
*on mobilisation:
**look for segmental and/or global spinal stiffness: spinal syndrome, chin-sternum distance, chin-acromion distance, tragus-acromion distance, finger-ground distance, Schöber index (joint stiffness), extensibility of the muscles of the lower limbs (anterior and posterior planes), etc.
**look for signs of disco-radicular impingement: direct or indirect Lasègue sign (sciatica) or Léri's sign (cruralgia), radiculalgia in hyperextension, radicular sonnette

<br />

===''Extra-spinal examination:'''===

*look for ''red flags'' (see below)
*examination of peripheral joints
*neurological examination of all four limbs
*look for signs of vertebro-basilar insufficiency
*thoraco-abdominal examination (to rule out visceral causes of back pain)
