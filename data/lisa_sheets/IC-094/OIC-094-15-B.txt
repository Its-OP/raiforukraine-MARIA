'''Positive diagnosis:'''

- pain localised around the sacrum, which may radiate to the buttocks and posterior thighs,

- reproduced by palpation/mobilisation of the sacrum or sacroiliac joints (sacroiliac tests)

- functional discomfort: walking, sitting

- look for signs of seriousness (red flags): general signs, inflammatory syndrome, history of trauma or weakening osteopathy, etc.

'''Differential diagnosis''': coccygodynia, low back pain with sacral irradiation

'''Duration of evolution:''' acute or chronic

'''Etiological diagnosis:'''

- look for trauma to the pelvis

- frontal X-rays of the pelvis and de Sèze cliché: to look for lumbosacral and sacroiliac osteoarthritis or signs of sacroiliitis

- discuss a CT scan of the pelvis or a bone scan if there is a suspicion of a fracture of the sacrum (sudden onset of sacralgia in elderly patients and/or those with weakening osteopathy, even if there is no traumatic factor)

- discuss an MRI of the pelvis if inflammatory rheumatism or another secondary cause is suspected

- extra-spinal cause: constipation, pelvic anomaly
