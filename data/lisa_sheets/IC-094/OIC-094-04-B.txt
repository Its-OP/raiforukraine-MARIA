===''Eléments orientant vers une origine DISCALE'''===

* age 25-50;
* associated factor: exertion or trauma
* history of rapidly improving lumbago;
* physical examination: disc syndrome combining medial, mechanical, impulsive lumbago, exacerbated by hyperextension, spinal syndrome.

Complications = radiculalgia, cauda equina syndrome.
<br />

===''Eléments orientant vers une origine INTERAPOPHYSAIRE'''===

* age > 50 years;
* median or unilateral low back pain, mechanical in character, exacerbated by walking or prolonged standing/sitting down
* pain referred remotely, without a precise path: buttocks, thighs, iliac spines;
* poor physical examination: hyperaesthesia of these painful areas on palpation, no disc syndrome, rare spinal syndrome.

Complications = narrowed lumbar canal with radicular claudication (onset of difficulty in walking''', [[Intermittent limb claudication SDD-069|intermittent limb claudication]]).'''''
