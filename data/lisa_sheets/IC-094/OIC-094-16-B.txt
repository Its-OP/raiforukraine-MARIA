'''Positive diagnosis:'''

- pain localised to the coccygeal area, without significant radiation

- reproduced by palpation/mobilisation of the coccyx or sacro-coccygeal region

- exacerbated by sitting and/or rising from a seated position

- functional discomfort: sitting (in the car, at work, etc.)

'''Etiological referral:''' pain in the seat > suspected subluxation and/or fracture

'''Recherche facteur déclenchant :'''

- trauma: very short delay between trauma and pain = certain liability; delay < 1 month = very likely liability; delay > 3 months, unlikely liability

- obesity/pregnancy = risk factor for subluxation

'''Differential diagnosis''': sacroiliac pain, anal '''[[Anal pain SDD-005|(anal pain)]]''', lumbar with coccygeal irradiation, pudendal neuralgia '''[[Pelvic pain SDD-099|(pelvic pain,]]''' '''[[Testicular pain SDD-100|testicular pain)]]''''

'''Duration of evolution:''' acute or chronic (most acute coccygodynia heals spontaneously within a few weeks)
