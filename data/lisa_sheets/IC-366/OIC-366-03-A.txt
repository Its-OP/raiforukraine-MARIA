'''Transmission risk factors depending on the victim:''''

- Blood EALB: the deeper the exposure and the dirtier the equipment, the greater the risk

- Sexual EALB: genital lesions and the existence of a previous STI increase the risk of transmission. In addition, anal intercourse, especially when receptive, is more risky than any other form of intercourse.

'''Risk factors for transmission depending on the source person:''' Whether blood or sexual EALB, the risk correlates with the level of viral replication in the source patient.
