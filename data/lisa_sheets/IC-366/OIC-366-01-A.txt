Accidental exposure to biological fluids (AEBF) can be of blood or sexual origin.


EALB covers all situations in which a person is exposed to the biological fluids of another individual (blood, sexual or non-sexual secretions such as faeces, urine, sputum, etc.).


When it is sanguine :

- It can be "professional" (puncture, cut, projection) or "non-professional" (sexual intercourse or drug use).

- Often linked to ''non-compliance with standard hygiene precautions''.

When it's sexual :

- The intercourse may be consensual or occur as part of a rape

- Often linked to the non-use of a condom or its malfunctioning
