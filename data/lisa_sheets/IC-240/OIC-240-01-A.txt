'''Definition of hypoglycaemia: clinical AND biological = Whipple's Triad''''

* signs of neuroglucopenia
* and a ''SIMULTANEOUSLY low'' (''not capillary'') ''venous glycaemia

- and the ''correction of symptoms'' when blood sugar levels return to normal.


'''''ATTENTION:'''''

- Symptoms and low blood sugar must be ''SIMULTANEOUS''.

- '''VENOUS AND NON-CAPILLARY GLYCEMIA'''

o Non-diabetic: GV< 0.50 g/l (2.75 mmol/l) (SFE 2013)

o Diabetes: GV< 0.70 g/l (3.85 mmol/l)

o Diagnosis of biological hypoglycaemia without clinical symptoms only possible in diabetics

- NEUROGLUCOPENIC AND NON-ADRENERGIC SYMPTOMS (earlier and less frequent)

- '''No diagnosis if no documentation of low GV and symptoms.'''
