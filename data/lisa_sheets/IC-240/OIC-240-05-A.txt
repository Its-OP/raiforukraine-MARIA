|'''Drug class'''
|'''Mechanism of action'''
|-
|Insulins
|Direct action of insulin
|-
|'''Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides''''
|Insulin secretion by binding of the sulphonamides receptor to the surface of the pancreatic B cell, independently of blood glucose levels.
|-
|'''Glinides''''
|Insulin secretors by binding of the sulphonamide receptor to the surface of the pancreatic B cell independently of glycaemia.

Fast acting and short half-life
|-
|'''''<small>Biguanides</small>'''''
|<small>''no risk of hypoglycaemia (if and only if alcohol (itself hypoglycaemic!)''</small>
|-
|'''''<small>GLP1 analogues</small>'''''
|<small>Insulin-secreting by binding of the GLP1 receptor to the surface of the pancreatic B cell (gluco-dependent action). Not hypoglycaemic +++</small>.

<u><small>Hypoglycaemia possible if insulin secretors or associated insulin!!!! Hypoglycemia secondary to other treatments +++</small></u>
