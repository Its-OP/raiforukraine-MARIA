'''A. In diabetic subjects'''

*Poorly-adapted insulin treatment
*Poorly-adapted treatment with insulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas and meglitinides).
*mismatch between insulin dose and meal, or use of hypoglycaemic medication and no meal
*gastroparesis

Metformin, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists alone cannot be responsible for hypoglycaemia.


'''B.    In non-diabetic patients

*Alcohol, especially in cases of acute and severe alcoholism.
*Drug-induced, especially in elderly patients or those taking multiple medications (certain quinolones, quinine, pentamidine, indomethacin, etc.), but also unacknowledged use of insulin or insulin secretagogues in a psychiatric context.
*Tumour: Insulinoma ++.
*Visceral insufficiency: severe hepatic insufficiency; severe renal insufficiency.
*Severe malnutrition
*Deficiency in counter-regulatory hormones: peripheral or central adrenal insufficiency (in adults, deficiencies in other counter-regulatory hormones do not cause hypoglycaemia).


'''In patients for whom the aetiological diagnosis is not obvious,''' for whom venous sampling during hypoglycaemia could not be performed and <u>after adrenal insufficiency has been ruled out,</u> the 72-hour young test is the reference test for diagnosing hypoglycaemia in the non-diabetic subject.

In addition to the clinical context, measurement of blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide, in the event of an early test, will help to differentiate between these different aetiologies. will help to differentiate between these different aetiologies.

This will highlight the following results <u>in venous hypoglycaemia</u>:

- Insulinoma, ''hidden intake of insulin secretagogues'': insulin, elevated C-peptide

- ''Hidden intake of insulin:''

- If injection of exogenous insulin recognised by the insulin dosage kit used: high insulin, low peptide-C

- If injection of exogenous insulin not recognised by the insulin dosing kit used: insulin, low C-peptide

- Visceral insufficiency, adrenal insufficiency, severe malnutrition, alcohol: low insulin and peptide-C levels
