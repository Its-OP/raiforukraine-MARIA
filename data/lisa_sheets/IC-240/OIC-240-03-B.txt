'''2 types of signs'''

*Neurovegetative signs: Palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger pangs, tremors

*Neuroglycopenic signs: consciousness disorders, concentration disorders, speech disorders, coma, memory disorders, visual disorders (blurred vision, diplopia, etc.), focal or generalised convulsions, confusion, behavioural disorders or psychiatric syndrome, sensory-motor deficit, paresthesia, limb coordination disorders, diplopia, etc.

The presence of neuroglycopenic signs, which are more specific than vegetative signs, means that a search must be made for organic hypoglycaemia.


In the case of organic hypoglycaemia in a non-diabetic subject, symptoms are most likely to occur on an empty stomach or between meals, at night or during physical activity.

This symptomatology is rapidly reversible after the intake of fast sugars.
