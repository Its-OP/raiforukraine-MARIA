'''A hormone and hypoglycaemic growth factors'''

*insulin, the main hypoglycaemic factor, whose concentration rises after a meal and falls during fasting
*A growth factor related to insulin, IGF2, whose hypoglycaemic effect is only significant at very high concentrations.


'''Hyperglycaemic hormones:'''

*glucagon
*growth hormone
*catecholamines
*cortisol


'''When blood sugar levels fall'''

*Secretion of glucagon, adrenaline and growth hormone when blood glucose levels fall below 0.65 g/L (3.6 mmol/l).
*Secretion of cortisol when blood glucose levels fall below 0.60 g/L (3.3 mmol/l).
