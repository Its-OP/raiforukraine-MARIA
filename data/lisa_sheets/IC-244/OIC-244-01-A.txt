Pituitary tumour syndrome characterised by :

'''[[Unusual acute and chronic headache in adults and children|Headache]]''', typically frontal or retro-orbital, localised without proportionality to the size of the adenoma.

'''Visual disorders [[Acute visual impairment|(Acute visual impairment)]]''' due to compression of the optic pathways (''chiasmatic syndrome'') resulting in an amputation of the visual field (observed by Goldman or automated perimetry): superior temporal quadranopsia then bitemporal hemianopia.

A careful clinical examination, eye by eye, looks for an amputation of the visual field and a drop in visual acuity.

Intracranial hypertension, exceptionally: persistent headache, jet nausea/vomiting, bilateral mydriasis.

Pituitary apoplexy'' presents with sudden, violent headaches, photophobia, ptosis, oculomotor paralysis and a pseudomeningeal picture. It is secondary to haemorrhagic infarction of a sometimes unrecognised pituitary adenoma.
