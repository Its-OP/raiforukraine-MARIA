The clinical picture of antehypophyseal insufficiency depends on its depth and duration of onset. The main clinical signs are: paleness, depilation, depigmentation (mammary areola, OGE), thin and fragile skin.

Clinical signs of corticotropic insufficiency: significant asthenia, low blood pressure, anorexia, weight loss.

'''Clinical signs of thyroid insufficiency''': those of hypothyroidism ([[Hypothyroidism]]) but to a lesser degree.

Clinical signs of gonadotropic insufficiency: amenorrhoea, loss of libido, depilation (face, OGE), erectile dysfunction, dyspareunia (atrophy of the vaginal and vulvar mucosa), infertility.

Clinical signs of somatotropic insufficiency: asthenia, little clinical evidence in adults.

Clinical signs of lactotropic deficiency: absence of milk production
