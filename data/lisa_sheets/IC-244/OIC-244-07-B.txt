[[File:Diagnostic strategy for hyperprolactinemia.pdf|vignette]]
  
Hyperprolactinaemia is "common" (1 to 1.5% of adults)

In the majority of cases, hyperprolactinaemia is caused by drugs.

Diagnostic strategy :

'''1 - Check that hyperprolactinaemia is real'''

Prolactin levels must be checked in a specialist hormone laboratory.

False hyperprolactinaemia is often observed: some assay kits measure aggregates of prolactin ("macroprolactinaemia") giving a falsely high value. Only monomeric prolactin is active.

''And ask yourself '''why''' has prolactin been measured?'' Sometimes "systematically" ...

'''2 - Eliminate pregnancy, medicinal and general causes'''

'''Pregnancy''' (hCG marker) +++( [[Normal pregnancy]])

'''''The most frequent causes of drug-induced illness'''''

Careful history-taking +++ to check for the use of hyperprolactinemic drugs

'''Physiopathology of the different etiologies of hyperprolactinaemia'''.

PRL secretion by the lactotropic cell is permanently inhibited by hypothalamic ''dopamine''.

'''-'''' '''Dopamine receptor antagonists''' (neuroleptics +++) oppose the effects of dopamine. [Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or SD-348 treatment]]

'''_ '''Disconnection hyperprolactinemia is related to '''interruption of dopamine trafficking'' in the pituitary stalk (section or compression of the pituitary stalk) by a non-lactotropic tumor.

'''- '''Prolactin adenoma (prolactinoma) is a tumour of the lactotropic cells, leading to an '''excessive production of PRL'''
