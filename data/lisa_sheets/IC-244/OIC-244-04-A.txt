The cardinal clinical sign of diabetes insipidus is the [[Polyuro-polydypsic syndrome SD-061]]. The onset is generally quite abrupt but the diagnosis may be delayed because the patient compensates for his water losses as long as he has access to water.

Insipid polyuria consists of hypotonic, hypoosmolar urine (< 250 - 300 mOsm/kgH20), eliminated in large quantities (> 2.5 litres / 24h or 30 to 40 mL per kg of body weight).

Polydipsia defines excessive thirst with a volume of liquid ingested generally exceeding 3 litres / 24h

As soon as the water balance is reversed (losses > inflows), the risk is that of hypernatremia, which will cause intracellular dehydration ([Disorders of acid-base balance and hydroelectrolytic disorders]).

'''Important: a pituitary adenoma is never accompanied by diabetes insipidus at the time of diagnosis, except in the special cases of pituitary apoplexy and/or after pituitary adenoma surgery.'''
