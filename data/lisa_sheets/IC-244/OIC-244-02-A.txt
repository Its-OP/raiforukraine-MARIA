'''Signs of hyperprolactinaemia'''

*In women: menstrual cycle disorders (oligomenorrhoea, secondary amenorrhoea), spontaneous or induced galactorrhoea.
*In men: erectile dysfunction. Gynecomastia may complete the clinical picture.
*In both sexes: decreased libido, infertility ([[Infertility of the couple: conduct of the first consultation|Infertility of the couple: conduct of the first consultation]].
*''The combination of amenorrhoea and galactorrhoea'' in women of childbearing age should systematically lead to the diagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia.'''''''

'''Clinical signs of excess secretion of growth hormone (GH): acromegaly''''

Clinical picture of progressive onset (previous comparative images) with :

*Enlargement of the extremities (hands, feet): ring sign, change in shoe size.
*Facial dysmorphia: enlarged, thickened nose, prominent forehead bumps, marked nasolabial folds, prognathism, macroglossia, loss of dental articulation (see EDMM college illustrations).
*Skeletal damage (less frequent): dorsal kyphosis, anterior projection of the sternum.
*Functional and general signs include to varying degrees: sweating (nocturnal), paresthesias of the hands (carpal tunnel syndrome), arthralgia, high blood pressure, unrefreshing sleep with asthenia and daytime tiredness.
*Associated comorbidities which should raise suspicion of acromegaly: sleep apnoea, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, goitre.

'''Clinical signs of ACTH hypersecretion by corticotropic adenoma (Cushing's disease), responsible for an excess of cortisol: Cushing's syndrome'''

Acquired morphological abnormalities (previous comparative images) secondary to the catabolic and anti-anabolic properties of glucocorticoids (see EDMM college illustrations):

*Myotrophy of the pelvic and scapular girdles, easy bruising, large purple stretch marks, telangiectasia/reddening of the face, faciotruncal obesity (due to changes in fat distribution) with "buffalo hump" and filling of the supra-clavicular hollows.
*Associated signs: mood disorders (depression, irritability, even acute psychosis), anxiety, reduced libido/impotence in men, spanio- or amenorrhoea in women. In cases of associated hyperandrogenism: moderate hirsutism, facial seborrhoea.
*Associated comorbidities that should raise suspicion of Cushing's syndrome: diabetes mellitus and/or arterial hypertension that is difficult to control and requires multiple medications, osteoporosis.


'''Clinical signs of excess secretion of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): rare'''

Thyrotoxicosis syndrome ([[Hyperthyroidism|hyperthyroidism]]) with homogeneous goitre and pituitary tumour syndrome.

'''Clinical signs of excess secretion of pituitary gonadotropins (LH/FSH):''''

Exceptionally, ovarian hyperstimulation in women with pelvic pain that may reveal ovarian macrocysts, macro-orchidism in men. Gonadotropic adenomas represent the majority of pituitary adenomas but present as clinically non-functional adenomas (non-pulsatile secretion of inactive subunits).
