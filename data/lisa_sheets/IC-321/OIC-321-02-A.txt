==Definition of pharmacological therapeutic monitoring (STP)==
Individual'' adaptation of the '''dosage''' of a drug based on the measurement of an '''exposure parameter'' of the body to this drug.

This parameter is :

* generally the '''minimum blood concentration''' (C<sub>min</sub> = residual concentration = valley, sampling to be done <u>just before</u> drug administration) measured at steady state in the patient,
* more rarely the '''maximum blood concentration'' (C<sub>max</sub> = sampling to be done <u>at peak</u> for aminoglycosides in order to judge efficacy).

=='''Conditions''' for STP==

*Existence of a concentration-effectiveness and/or concentration-toxicity relationship
*Inter-individual and/or intra-individual variability of drug concentrations linked to pathophysiological conditions (renal failure, etc.), drug interactions, etc.
*Target concentrations predictive of efficacy and/or toxicity.
*Drugs with a low therapeutic index

== '''Examples''' of drugs for which the STP ==
This list is <u>not exhaustive</u> :

* Antibiotics: aminoglycosides, vancomycin
* Antifungals: voriconazole
* Antivirals: antiretrovirals
* Anti-epileptics: valproic acid
* Anti-cancer drugs: methotrexate
* Psychotropic drugs: lithium
* Immunosuppressants: tacrolimus
* Cardiotonic glycoside: digoxin
