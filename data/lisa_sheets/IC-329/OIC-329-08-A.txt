The principles of transfusion sparing in the perioperative setting consist of :

- optimise the erythrocyte mass: pre-operative anaemia screening (search for martial deficiency), look for an indication for agents to stimulate erythropoiesis (orthopaedics).

- minimising blood loss: screening for haemostasis disorders during questioning, management of anti-coagulants and anti-platelet aggregants, good surgical haemostasis.

- improving tolerance to anaemia: determining the transfusion threshold for each patient, monitoring for signs of intolerance, optimising cardiac output, ventilation and oxygenation.

Optimising erythrocyte mass and improving tolerance to anaemia are principles that also apply in the medical and critical care sector. Transfusion thresholds are defined according to pathological circumstances and co-morbidities.
