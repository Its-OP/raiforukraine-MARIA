 '''General procedure:''''

Suspicion of infection must lead to rapid assessment of the patient with :

* clinical examination, bearing in mind that clinical signs may not be very intense in an immunocompromised patient
* biological examinations with measurement of inflammatory parameters (but sometimes absent if certain cytokines such as IL-6 are blocked)
* microbiological examinations adapted to the suspected germs
* imaging tests adapted to the context (site and type of suspected infection)

 '''Specific guidelines:''''

* Latent tuberculosis: treatment with isoniazid, combined with vitamin B6, for nine months. DMARDs may be administered concurrently one month after the start of this antibiotic treatment.
* Reactivation of tuberculosis: DMARs treatment temporarily suspended until complete resolution of the infectious event and appropriate antibiotic therapy.
* Other pulmonary infections (bacterial, fungal, including pneumocystis): treatment suspended, infection treated and background treatment reassessed.
* Digestive infections: treatment suspended, infection treated and background treatment reassessed.
* Urinary tract infections: treatment maintained or suspended depending on severity, treatment of infection and reassessment of background treatment.
* Hepatitis B reactivation:''' concomitant targeted antiviral therapy, monitoring of viremia (by PCR) and transaminases,
* Trivial skin infections (''bacterial fungal infections, uncomplicated genital or orofacial herpes virus infections): appropriate treatment without interruption of DMARDs.
* Severe skin infections (chickenpox, shingles): very rapid antiviral treatment at the recommended dose in immunocompromised patients, suspension of DMARD treatment for as long as the infection persists.
