Molecular therapies, which include polyclonal immunoglobulins, monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, chemokines and small molecules targeting signalling pathways;

Cellular therapies and gene therapies, which involve cell products that are manipulated ex vivo (the patient's cells are harvested and genetically modified "ex vivo" before being re-administered to the patient);

genetic vaccines'' and other gene therapies which exert their action directly ''in vivo'' (the cells of the targeted organ are modified ''in situ'').

These therapies are currently only authorised for modifying somatic cells (no modifications transmissible through descendants).
