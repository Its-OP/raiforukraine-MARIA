Occasionally, certain situations may require a temporary adjustment (travel, surgery, infection, etc.).

Three situations may lead to a permanent adjustment of these treatments:


'''Situation 1: insufficient efficiency'''

           persistence of clinical, biological or imaging signs associated with inflammatory disease activity after a sufficient period of time has elapsed since the initiation of disease-modifying therapy (this period varies according to the treatment) and satisfactory compliance.

           -reappearance of clinical, biological or imaging signs associated with inflammatory disease activity under treatment

In this context, compliance with treatment must be assessed.

In some cases, the serum concentration of the drug can be measured.

Examples of adjustments: increase in dosage, closer together (if infusions or subcutaneous injections), combination with or replacement by another background treatment''.


'''Situation 2: development of side effects or contraindications'''

'''-'''Occurrence of one or more side effects related to background treatment

'''-'''Appearance of a contraindication to maintaining current background treatment (infection, renal or hepatic insufficiency depending on the biomedicine, planned pregnancy, etc.)

''Examples of adjustments: reduction in dosage, spacing of doses, discontinuation and replacement by another background treatment''.


'''Situation 3: Complete and prolonged response (according to the objectives defined for each patient and each pathology)'''
