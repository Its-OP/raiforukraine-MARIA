The parameters and frequency of monitoring depend on the disease being treated, co-morbidities and the type of background treatment.

In all cases, three fields must be regularly assessed:

'''Treatment effectiveness'''

* signs of inflammatory disease activity (clinical, biological and imaging signs in accordance with the recommendations for the disease in question)
* concentration of the biomedicine in certain cases

Tolerance and side effects

* Infections: prevention and regular screening
* Neoplasia: prevention and regular screening
* Cardiovascular complications
* Biological monitoring (non-exhaustive list)

# adapted to the biomedicine prescribed
# blood count
# creatinemia
# transaminases
# lipid profile (certain biomedications modify the lipid profile)
# serum IgG concentration (in the case of treatment targeting B lymphocytes)

 '''Compliance with treatment'''
