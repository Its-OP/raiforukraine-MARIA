● The clinical presentation is that of [[Acute fever in children and adults|unilateral febrile lumbar pain 147]] in the absence of any lower urinary tract symptoms (the ''E. coli'' responsible for ANP are not the same as those responsible for cystitis)

● Pain frequently associated with nausea or vomiting linked to reflex ileus

● Radiation of pain (renal colic pain) should suggest a urinary tract obstruction, which is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency.

● [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|clinical severity 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]] being defined by the previously described criteria (obstructive, sepsis, septic shock, qSOFA 2 or 3, need for renal urine drainage). Acute obstructive pyelonephritis is, by definition, severe acute pyelonephritis. It is also known as febrile renal colic (if painful).
