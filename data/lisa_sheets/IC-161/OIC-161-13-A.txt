==There are fundamental clinical elements for the positive diagnosis of male urinary tract infection (MUTI, formerly "acute prostatitis"):==

*the occurrence of an '''acute symptomatology'''
*''the presence of [[Acute fever in children and adults|fever]]''' [[Fever 147|147]] +/- associated with chills

<br />

*There are descriptions of MUI without fever, called "cystitis like", but its diagnosis must be cautious, since the terrain of MUI is that of a man with pre-existing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which should not lead to a false diagnosis of infection.
*The other symptoms that are obviously frequently associated are LUTS during the filling phase with urinary burning.
*The main complications are severe sepsis and acute urine retention, which are diagnostic and therapeutic emergencies.
*Biological and radiological examinations (see dedicated question)
