*Second urine stream

*The thresholds for leucocyturia are only of value in cases other than those listed below. In fact, all these elements can be a source of leucocyturia outside of any infectious process:
**Recent urinary tract manipulation
**Presence of endo-urinary material
**Presence of a foreign body (stone, tumour)

*The accepted threshold for significant leucocyturia is ≥ 10<sup>4</sup> /mL.
*The threshold for significant bacteriuria in men is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL
*The threshold for significant bacteriuria in women is set at 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL except for E. coli and S. saprophyticus, for which the threshold is set at 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL.

*Whatever the case, the clinical situation always takes precedence over these different thresholds and the diagnosis of UTI should not be ruled out<s>e</s> if the clinical situation is obvious.
*Genuine UTIs have negative leucocyturia (immunodepression, etc).

*On the other hand, bacteriuria with leucocyturia in the absence of symptoms should not lead to treatment because it is a case of urinary colonisation.
*Finally, remember that the ECBU is not an infallible test and that in 10 to 15% of cases, it proves negative even though the infection is clinically proven (bacteria "decapitated" by antibiotic therapy, ECBU performed incorrectly, etc.).
