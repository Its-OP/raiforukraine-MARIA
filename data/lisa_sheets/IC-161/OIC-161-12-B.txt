*Imaging (ideally a CT scan) must be carried out systematically in the case of ANP at risk of complications (within 24 hours) or severe [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|Severe ANP 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]] (as an emergency).
*In the case of ANP at risk of complications, treatment is based on inpatient IV C3G.
*complication risk criteria: male, pregnancy, urinary tract anomaly, age (over 65 with at least 2 Fried criteria; over 75), immunosuppression, renal failure (GFR < 30 ml/min)
*Severity criteria: obstruction, need for urine drainage, sepsis, septic shock, qSOFA 2 or 3.
**Acute obstructive pyelonephritis is by definition severe acute pyelonephritis. It is also known as febrile renal colic (if painful).
*ESBL risk factors: ESBL colonisation < 3 months, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or C2-3G < 3 months, fluoroquinolone < 3 months, hospitalisation < 3 months, living in a long-stay institution, travel to an ESBL-endemic area (southern Europe, Mediterranean basin, Middle East, India, south-east Asia).


'''<u>PNA at risk of complication</u>''''

. Parenteral C3G (if hospitalised) or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (unless FQ < 3 months)

. if contraindicated: aminoglycosides or aztreonam

==In cases of severe ANP, treatment is based on:==

*resuscitation measures
*Antibiotic therapy must be started immediately (6% extra mortality per hour of delay in starting antibiotic therapy) if the patient has severe sepsis.
**C3G IV + high dose amikacin (Aminoside recommended for UTIs as it is less resistant to BGN than gentamicin).
**If allergic to penicillins: Aztreonam + Amikacin
**If there are risk factors for ESBL: carbapenem + amikacin (or piperacillin-tazobactam + amikacin if there is no septic shock and the strain is susceptible).
*In the event of urinary tract obstruction: emergency drainage or diversion of the upper urinary tract. This treatment must not delay antibiotic therapy, which must be started as soon as possible.

<br />

*A second course of antibiotics, ideally an oral antibiotic with a narrower spectrum, should be administered as soon as possible for a total treatment period of 10 days.
