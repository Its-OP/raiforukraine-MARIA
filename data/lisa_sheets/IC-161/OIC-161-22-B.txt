*Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial infections in children.
*Favoured by: immaturity with abnormal bladder emptying (constipation plays a role) and bacterial reservoir (prepuce in young boys).
*In the first few months of life, urinary tract infections are more common in boys (up to 20% of infants under 3 months with an isolated fever) than in girls.
*Often associated with RVU (functional or malformative).
