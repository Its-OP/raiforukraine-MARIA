*Be absolutely wary of the too easy diagnosis of "recurrent cystitis" when a woman has LUTS during the filling phase associated with bacteriuria; this "true" diagnosis is rare''.
*Differentiate between the management of young patients starting their sexual life and post-menopausal patients.

<br />

*Prove the infectious nature of the infection: a patient labelled as having "recurrent cystitis" must have confirmation by ECBU so that the link between symptoms and bacteriuria can be established.
*Micturition schedule +++''; this simple examination makes it easy to rule out "false recurrent cystitis"; for example, idiopathic overactive bladder...

<br />

*Be wary of the patient who is [[Menopause, premature ovarian failure, andropause, age-related androgen deficiency|post-menopause 124]], smoker, with SBAU and sometimes [[Haematuria|haematuria 260]] who should be investigated for [[Bladder tumours|bladder tumour 314]].
*Flowmetry
*Ultrasound of the urinary tract with assessment of post-micturition residual.
*Other examinations should be carried out according to the context and are not systematic.
