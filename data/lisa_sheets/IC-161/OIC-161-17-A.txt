==Circumstances that should raise the suspicion of a urinary tract infection=

====Acute pyelonephritis====

*Isolated fever
**in children under 3 months of age
**lasting 48 hours or more
**in a child with uropathy or a history of urinary tract infection

/! A thorough paediatric clinical examination is necessary to exclude any other cause of fever.

*febrile urinary tract signs
*In newborns/ young infants <3 months: feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, jaundice, vomiting, etc.
*febrile low back pain in older children

<br />

====Lower urinary tract infection====

*In older children, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are manifested by symptoms such as dysuria, pollakiuria, burning of the bladder, urgency, foul-smelling urine, urinary incontinence, haematuria and suprapubic pain. Fever and back pain are signs of upper urinary tract involvement.
*The diagnosis of lower urinary tract infection is based on the existence of [[micturition disorders in children|SBAU 51]] associated with a positive urine dipstick.

<br />

==SEVERITY SIGNS OF PNA===

*Risk factors for severe ANP
**history of uropathy: increased risk of complications
**history of recent ANP: increased risk of resistant bacteria
**< less than 3 months: risk of associated bacteremia
**immunodepression
**lithiasis: obstruction
*Signs of severity = signs of sepsis (tachycardia, polypnoea, impaired consciousness, peripheral perfusion anomaly, oliguria), signs of dehydration or dietary repercussions in infants.
