*Simple cystitis: no imaging test recommended
*Cystitis at risk of complications: no imaging test recommended

==Recurrent cystitis (see dedicated section). A work-up should be discussed on a case-by-case basis; the tests that may be carried out depending on the context are:==

*ultrasonography of the urinary tract with measurement of post-micturition residue
*urinary flowmetry
*urodynamic assessment
*CT urography
*cystoscopy

*Acute simple pyelonephritis: no imaging test recommended as first-line treatment for a first episode. In the event of a poor clinical course, significant pain or persistent symptoms after 48-72 hours, an imaging test should be carried out: uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound scan.
*Pyelonephritis at risk of complications: uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound within 24 hours.
*Severe acute pyelonephritis (acute obstructive pyelonephritis/febrile nephritic colic/purulent retention of the upper urinary tract or pyelonephritis complicated by [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|sepsis or septic shock 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]]): urgent uro-CT scan or, failing that, urinary tract ultrasound scan.

==Other imaging tests have no place in the initial management :==

*MRI unnecessary except in very special cases
*Retrograde cystography essential if the context is suggestive of vesico-uretero-renal reflux (classically evoked from the second episode of pyelonephritis, but this figure is indicative).
*Cystoscopy: to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
*Cintigraphy:
**DMSA in order to assess the functional value of each kidney and look for sequelae of renal scarring (in the case of repeated pyelonephritis, a non-functional kidney which is a source of infection may indicate nephrectomy).
**MAG3 in order to identify an obstacle in the urinary tract (in the case of pyeloureteral junction syndrome, for example).
