*The treatment of MUI is detailed in the figure below.
*Note that drainage of a patient with [[Acute retention of urine|acute retention of urine 347]] in this context must be carried out urgently either by urethral catheterisation (bladder catheterisation is no longer a contraindication subject to an atraumatic procedure, to learn how to catheterise: <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMPPG_CnU-M</nowiki>) or suprapubic catheterisation.
*The duration of treatment currently recommended is 14 days if fluroroquinolones, IV C3G or cotrimoxazole are used. For other molecules, the current duration is 21 days.
*The occurrence of an infectious episode in men should systematically prompt a search for an underlying aetiology: [[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia 127]], urethral stricture, [[Urinary incontinence and micturition disorders in adults and the elderly|bladder failure 125]], etc.
