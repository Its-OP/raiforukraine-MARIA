==The additional tests currently recommended differ according to the type of urinary tract infection==.

==For uncomplicated cystitis, the only recommended test is the BU (taking into account the pitfalls listed below), which should be interpreted with common sense.

==Cystitis at risk of complication:==

*Urinalysis may be performed (but should not change the course of action if it is negative and the clinical picture is suggestive of cystitis).
*ECBU with systematic antibiotic susceptibility testing

==Simple acute pyelonephritis:==

*Urinalysis may be performed (but should not change the course of action if it is negative and the clinical picture is suggestive of cystitis).
*ECBU with systematic antibiotic susceptibility test
*Imaging: at a distance if pain or fever persists for 48 hours: non-injected AP CT scan with possible injection if diagnostic doubt (absence of obstacle) or complication (abscess).

==Pyelonephritis with risk of complications:==

*Urinalysis may be performed (but should not change the course of action if it is negative and the clinical picture is suggestive of cystitis).
*ECBU with systematic antibiotic susceptibility testing
*urea
*creatinine
*CRP
*Imaging: non-injected AP CT scan with possible injection if there is any doubt about the diagnosis (absence of an obstacle) or a complication (abscess) or, failing that, ultrasound scan of the kidneys and bladder + DBS within 24 hours.

==Severe acute pyelonephritis (acute obstructive pyelonephritis/febrile nephritic colic/purulent retention of the upper urinary tract or pyelonephritis complicated by severe sepsis or [[Sepsis/Bacteremia/Fungemia in adults and children|septic shock 157]] and [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|158]]):==

*Urinalysis may be performed (but should not change the course of action if it is negative and the clinical picture is suggestive of cystitis).
*ECBU with antibiotic susceptibility test
*urea
*creatinine
*complete blood count
*PCR
*blood cultures
*Imaging: as a matter of urgency: non-injected AP CT scan with possible injection if there is diagnostic doubt (absence of obstruction) or complication (abscess).
