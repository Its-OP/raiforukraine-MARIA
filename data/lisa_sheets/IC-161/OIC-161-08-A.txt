==The diagnosis of cystitis is fairly straightforward, but there are a few important points to bear in mind:==

*These are ''acute'' symptoms. Old symptoms are very rarely of infectious origin '''even if bacteriuria is demonstrated'''
*The most frequent symptoms of the lower urinary tract (forget the term "urinary incontinence and micturition disorders in adults and the elderly|urinary functional signs 125]") are those of the filling phase:
**pollakiuria
**urinary urgency
**incontinence sometimes
*Dysuria is sometimes noted, but this is related to pollakiuria (the patient "forces an empty bladder" because the need is felt).
*The main symptom = urinary burning
*Other frequent symptoms: discreet [[Haematuria|haematuria 260]], pyuria, bladder tenesmus with pelvic pain/weight at the end of micturition.
*On the other hand, these symptoms are the only way of expressing a "bladder disorder". Many pathologies (idiopathic overactive bladder, bladder tumour, etc.) manifest themselves in the same way. It is often a careful history that helps to distinguish between a recent and an old event.

<br />

*'''<u>Remember that the evolution of simple cystitis is not pyelonephritis!</u>''''

<br />

*In the absence of any anatomical or functional abnormality, cystitis does not become pyelonephritis (hence the classification of cystitis at risk of complications). This rare complication accounts for less than 1% of cystitis cases. This explains why the clinical presentation of ANP is febrile back pain without any lower urinary tract symptoms.
