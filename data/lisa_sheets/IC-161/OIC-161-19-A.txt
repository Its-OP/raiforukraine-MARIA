==Acute pyelonephritis==

====Antibiotic treatment====
Before any antibiotic treatment, an ECBU must be carried out

In the event of fever in a child with signs of urinary tract infection (clinical signs, positive urine dipstick), probabilistic antibiotic treatment should be started as soon as possible after an ECBU has been performed in order to eradicate the infection, prevent bacteraemia, improve clinical condition and reduce the risk of renal damage during the acute phase of the infection and the risk of renal scarring.

*IV treatment followed by PO
**In case of complication factors and/or < 3 months and/or doubt about compliance with oral treatment
***ceftriaxone or cefotaxime or amikacin followed by oral retreatment
**in the event of signs of severity
***ceftriaxone or cefotaxime + amikacin
**followed by PO after 2 to 4 days, depending on the results of the antibiogram and once apyrexia has been achieved, by treatment with cefixime or cotrimoxazole (after 1 month) for 10 to 14 days.

<br />

*Initial oral treatment with cefixime: ''after 3 months'', ''in the absence of risk factors or signs of severity and if home monitoring is possible and appropriate''.
**to be adapted to the antibiogram, followed by cotrimoxazole if sensitive, to avoid prolonged use of oral C3G with a high potential for selecting resistant bacteria.

/in case of G+ cocci on direct examination: suspect enterococcus, and choose amoxicillin (in combination with gentamicin in case of sepsis)

====Hospitalisation criteria====

*< less than 3 months
*signs of severity
*difficult to monitor at home

<br />

==CYSTITIS==
Initial treatment of lower urinary tract infections or cystitis in children involves oral outpatient treatment with cefixime, cotrimoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, followed by adjustment according to the results of the ECBU.

Duration 3 to 5 days

Look for factors that may contribute to the disease

==FOLLOW-UP/ COMPLICATIONS/ UROPATHY RESEARCH===

*Complications of ANP
**short-term: abscess, sepsis
**long-term: risk of hypertension if multiple, untreated or delayed ANP (renal scarring)

*Look for uropathy
**ANP is favoured by vesico-ureteral reflux, which may be functional or malformative (uropathy).
***Systematic ultrasound at first episode
***Retrograde cystography if abnormal echo or recurrent ANP (apart from favouring factors such as bladder instability).
**/! beware of posterior urethral valves in infant boys = MEDICAL - SURGICAL EMERGENCY, be aware of abnormalities on ultrasound (struggling bladder, dilated urinary tract), abnormal renal function, abnormal micturition stream, etc.
**/Examine the sacral region carefully and check that the neurological examination is normal (spinal cord abnormality).

*Follow-up
**For ANP: ensure apyrexia, if fever persists, suspect a complication (abscess), check compliance if oral treatment, check sensitivity to antibiotic susceptibility test.
**For cystitis: look for contributing factors in the event of recurrence, in particular constipation, unstable bladder, etc.
**Nephrological or uropaediatric opinion if
***voiding abnormalities (pollakiuria, leakage, poor stream in male infants = urethral valves)
***repeated infections
***ultrasound abnormality
