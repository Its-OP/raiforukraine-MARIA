A-ACUTE GRAVIDIC CYSTITIS (see CEGO item 2C-028 [[2C-028]])

1-Diagnosis ( cf CEGO Acute gravidic cystitis (clinical) [[Acute gravidic cystitis (clinical) 2C-028-DP-A01|2C-028-DP-A01]] and Acute gravidic cystitis (biological diagnosis) [[Acute gravidic cystitis (biological diagnosis) 2C-028-DP-A02|2C-028-DP-A02]])

*The clinical presentation of cystitis is unchanged in pregnant women. However, it is important to be wary of pollakiuria, which is a frequent symptom in the absence of any pathology, particularly in the 3rd trimester.
*An ECBU with antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended.
*Diagnosis is made if leucocyturia ≥ 10<sup>4</sup>/mL and bacteriuria ≥ 10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL for ''E. coli'' or ''Staphylococcus saprophyticus'' and ≥ 10<sup>4</sup> CFU/mL for other enterobacteria, enterococci, ''Corynebacterium urealyticum'', P. ''aeruginosa'' and ''S. aureus''.
*
*Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the antibiogram result.


2-Treatment (cf CEGO Acute gravidic cystitis (treatment) [[Acute gravidic cystitis (treatment) 2C-028-PC-A02|2C-028-PC-A02]])

*Probabilistic treatment should be started without waiting for the results of the antibiogram.
*Current recommendations for antibiotic treatment are (molecules in order of prescription preference):
**Bosfomycin-Trometamol in 1 dose
**Pivmecillinam for 7 days
**
**A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU until delivery.


3-Urinary colonisation in pregnant women

Urinary colonisation (≥ 10<sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) in a pregnant woman must be treated. Treatment adapted to the results of the antibiogram must be started as soon as the results are received (no probabilistic treatment). Treatment with amoxicillin for 7 days is the first-line antibiotic. A follow-up ECBU 8 to 10 days after stopping treatment, followed by a monthly ECBU, is recommended until delivery.


ACUTE GRAVID B-PYELONEPHRITIS (cf CEGO item 2C-028 [[2C-028]])

1-Acute gravid pyelonephritis (clinical) [[Acute gravid pyelonephritis (clinical) 2C-028-DP-A03|2C-028-DP-A03]]

2-Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (biological diagnosis) [[Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (biological diagnosis) 2C-028-DP-A04|2C-028-DP-A04]]

3-Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (treatment) [[Acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy (treatment) 2C-028-PC-B01|2C-028-PC-B01]]


NB: it is not necessary to know the dosage of antibiotics.
