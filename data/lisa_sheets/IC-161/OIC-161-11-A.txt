● Except in special cases of excessive vomiting preventing the use of oral antibiotics or social isolation preventing outpatient treatment, simple ANP must be treated as an outpatient.

● First-line antibiotic treatment is based on fluoroquinolones for 7 days (unless antibiotics in this class have been taken within 3 months).

● In rare cases of uncomplicated ANP requiring hospital management, treatment with IV C3G should be preferred and will be adapted after the ECBU.

● Progress should be rapidly satisfactory within 48-72 hours; in the event of failure, imaging must be performed and the patient admitted to hospital.
