.● ''Escherichia coli'' is the main bacterium isolated during community urinary tract infections (around 70 to 90% depending on the series). In children E.coli is the most frequently encountered followed by ''Proteus mirabilis'', ''Enterococcus faecalis'' and ''Klebsiella.''

● "Staphylococcus saprophyticus" is also a pathogenic agent frequently encountered during cystitis in young women, particularly during the summer period. Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a gram-positive cocci bacterium that does not have a nitrate reductase enzyme, which explains the absence of nitrites in the urine sample during true UTIs.

==Risk factors for ESBL or fluoroquinolone resistance:==

*A history of infection or colonisation with EBLSE in the previous 3 months.
*Antibiotic therapy with one of the following in the previous 3 months: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, C2G, C3G, fluoroquinolones.
*Travel to an EBLSE-endemic area (southern Europe, Mediterranean basin, Middle East, India, south-east Asia).
*Hospitalization of less than 3 months
*Living in a long-stay institution

==The main mechanisms of resistance encountered in enterobacteria are summarised in Tables 1 and 2.==

*Table 1 summarises the chromosomal resistance mechanisms, i.e. those systematically present in the wild state:
**Group 2 naturally secretes a low-level penicillinase.
***Group 3 naturally secretes a cephalosporinase.
*Table 2 summarises the resistance mechanisms acquired either by hyperexpression of their chromosomal enzyme or by acquisition of a plasmid enzyme.
