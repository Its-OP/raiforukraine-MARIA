Normal biology does not rule out the diagnosis of acute appendicitis: disturbed CBC in 80% of cases, normal CRP in 50% of cases.

Clinical scores for appendicitis have been defined to reduce unnecessary and costly investigations based on clinical history, physical examination and simple biological data.

Highly probable diagnosis of acute appendicitis (HAS 2012): in the combined presence of right iliac fossa defensiveness, hyperleukocytosis greater than 10,000/mm3 and CRP greater than 8 mg/L.

The imaging tests that may be ordered are :

- PA ultrasonography: sensitivity of 80%, to be preferred in children and women of childbearing age, and in cases of urological or gynaecological differential diagnoses;

- CT-AP: 95% sensitivity, preferable in cases of suspected complicated disease and in obese patients.

In children:

- MRI is to be preferred, if your technical resources allow, as a 2nd<sup>nd</sup> intention given its non-irradiating nature and its high diagnostic value in the event of technical failure of ultrasound or persistent clinico-ultrasound discordance.

- CT-PA: In paediatrics, CT is of less interest the younger the child, due to the absence of intraperitoneal fat. In practice, CT is of little use, apart from pre-drainage percutaneous assessments, residual abscesses from operated appendicular peritonitis and in the event of persistent clinico-echographic discordance, in the absence of easy access to MRI.
