Abdominal ultrasound (as first-line treatment):

- Sensitivity of 80%, to be preferred in children and women of childbearing age, and in cases of urological or gynaecological differential diagnoses.

- increased appendicular diameter (> 6 mm)

- thickened wall (> 3 mm) is a better indicator than the diameter

- incompressible appendage

- pain when the catheter is passed.

- A hyperechoic image with a posterior shadow cone is in favour of a stercolith.

- infiltration of peri-appendicular fat

- echogenic fluid effusion in the right iliac fossa or pelvis.

- pneumoperitoneum


pelvic MRI without injection of contrast medium (preferable in children if the technical facilities allow) or abdominopelvic CT scan with injection of contrast medium

- 95% sensitivity, preferable in cases of suspected complicated forms and in obese patients

- increase in the diameter of the appendix

- wall thickening

- infiltration of peri-appendicular fat.

- very useful for looking for signs of complications (abscesses and peritonitis)
