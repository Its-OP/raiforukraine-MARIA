The normal appendix is :

- appended to the cecum, located in FID, 2 to 20 cm long and 4 to 6 mm wide.

- It is implanted at the point where the three longitudinal muscle bands of the right colon converge.

- Its blood supply comes from the appendicular artery, the terminal branch of the ileocolic artery.

Acute appendicitis evolves in 3 phases:

- catarrhal appendicitis: obstruction downstream of the appendicular lumen

''By hyperplasia of the lymphoid tissues or obstruction by a stercolith''.

''More rarely due to a parasitic infection, Crohn's disease or a tumour''.

- suppurative appendicitis: microbial proliferation and inflammation extending to the 4 parietal layers

- gangrenous appendicitis: arterial ischaemia progressing to necrosis and perforation.
