Anatomical variations are frequent and modify the clinical picture:

- retro-caecal location: more frank psoitis, less marked FID pain, pain reproduced in lateral decubitus by bi-manual palpation

- pelvic location: functional urinary signs (pollakiuria, dysuria), rectal tenesmus, symptoms that may suggest a gynaecological cause, right-sided pain on rectal and vaginal examination

- Meso-coeliac location: febrile occlusion picture

- subhepatic location: fever, pain and tenderness in the right hypochondrium
