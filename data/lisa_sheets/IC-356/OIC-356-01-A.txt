Symptoms and clinical forms in children are :

- in older children: spontaneous pain in FID, recent: identical to adult symptoms

- in young children: pain of less precise location, recent, with moderate fever, nausea or vomiting. It is important to carry out a clinical examination in search of the defences that characterise appendicitis, as opposed to the many differential diagnoses.

- in infants: altered general condition, fever, vomiting, dehydration, abdominal distension, diarrhoea.
