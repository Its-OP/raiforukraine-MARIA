==Definition==
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD),''' like Attention Deficit Disorder with or without Hyperactivity (ADHD)'',''''' are ''neurodevelopmental disorders'''(NDD) - cf.[[Item 55]]'' for the common characteristics of NDD.

ASDs are characterised by abnormalities in ''communication skills and social interaction'' associated with ''restricted behaviour, interests and activities''. These particularities have existed since early childhood. They have a systematic but variable functional impact.

== Semiology ==

===Particularities of communication skills and social interaction===
These affect several areas of development:

* Non-verbal communication :
** Lack or delay of instrumental gestures of social value
**infrequent or variable eye contact
**Rarity or variability of communicative gestures/mimicry (e.g. pointing).
*Verbal communication is marked by "pragmatic difficulties":
**Difficulty accessing figurative language
**Low functional value of language
*Social and emotional reciprocity:
**Few smiles in response
**Lack of joint attention
**Difficulty carrying on a conversation/reciprocal exchanges.
*Social relationships:
**Rare or variable social play.
**Difficulty understanding and using social conventions
**relational isolation/low social motivation

===Restricted behaviour, interests and activities===
It is manifested by :       

* Repetitive and stereotyped behaviour:
**Repetitive use of objects
**Verbal stereotypies, echolalia, sometimes idiosyncratic language
*Intolerance to change:
**Adherence to routines, intolerance to change
**Ritualised behaviour
*Restricted interests:
**Attachment to sometimes unusual objects
**Focused and persevering interests
*Sensory peculiarities: hyper- or hypo-reactivity to noise, visual stimuli, pain (see item 138)...
