==Criteria for positive diagnosis==
The diagnosis of ASD is based on the '''early presence in''' the development of d''''anomalies in communication and social relationships'' as well as a '''restricted character of behaviours, interests and activities'', the whole being associated with a '''functional repercussion.'''

The positive diagnosis of ASD is supported by a multi-disciplinary assessment including:

*A clinical examination
*A developmental history and characterisation of current symptoms (semi-structured interview with parents, such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised version - ADI-R).
*Observation of the child (e.g. using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale - ADOS)


In the case of a positive diagnosis of ASD, you must specify :

*The severity of symptoms
*the existence of an intellectual development disorder
*the existence of a language disorder
*any known genetic or medical pathology or environmental factors
*any co-existing disorders

==Main comorbidities===

*Other neurodevelopmental disorders (see item 55), in particular :
**Intellectual development disorder (40%)
**ADHD (30-40%)
**Language disorders (20% have no verbal language)
**Developmental motor coordination disorder
**Specific learning disability
**Tics
*Epilepsy (20%)
*Certain psychiatric syndromes and disorders, including :
**Anxiety disorders, depressive disorders (cf. [[Item 66]]), obsessive-compulsive symptoms and disorders.
**Sleep disorders
**Catatonic syndromes

== Main differential diagnoses ==

*Other neurodevelopmental disorders
*Deafness
*Schizophrenic disorders (see Item 63)

== The diagnostic process is completed by ==

*An "etiological investigation" based on possible warning signs (additional clinical analysis, complementary tests, genetic work-up).
*The search for "problem behaviours" (aggression, self-vulnerable behaviour, etc.) often linked to non-psychiatric pathologies or environmental factors.
