=='''DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria (Rank B)'''==
The DSM-5 requires a sufficient number of symptoms of ''inattention'' (cf. [[Attention Deficit Disorder SD-129|attention disorder]]) and/or ''hyperactivity'' (cf. [[Agitation SD-114|agitation]]) with an impact on at least two areas of functioning. The symptoms must have begun ''before the age of 12 and are long-lasting'' (> 6 months).

The positive diagnosis of ADHD is supported by :

*A clinical examination
*A developmental history and a description of current symptomatology (which may be supported by semi-structured interviews or questionnaires) - cf. [[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|psychomotor development abnormality]]
*Observation of the child and characterisation of his/her behaviour and achievements in different contexts (school questionnaires/ report cards/school achievements).
*An analysis of the functional impact of the symptoms


The "diagnosis of ADHD is clinical". Neuropsychological tests and IQ tests - which are often impaired - can help to characterise the child's cognitive profile, but have no diagnostic value.

The DSM-5 distinguishes several clinical presentations, which may evolve over time:

*Predominantly inattentive
*Hyperactivity/impulsivity predominant
*Combined form

==Comorbidities and differential diagnoses==)

=== Main comorbidities ===

*Other neurodevelopmental disorders (50-80%) - see [[Psychomotor development abnormality SD-115|developmental abnormality]], [[Language and/or phonation disorders SD-134|language disorders]], [[Item 55]]
*Behavioural disorders in children and adolescents SD-133|behavioural disorders]] - cf [[Behavioural disorders in children and adolescents|Item 68]]
**Oppositional Defiant Disorder
**Conduct disorder
*Anxiety disorders (33%) - see [[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]] and Item 66
*Obsessive-compulsive disorder
*Mood disorders - see [[Sad Mood/Moral Pain SD-123|Sad Mood]].
*Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|sleep disorders]]
*Substance abuse disorders - cf. [[First addictology consultation SD-292|first addictology consultation]]

=== Main differential diagnoses ===

*Other neurodevelopmental disorders
*Mood disorders ([[Bipolar disorder I and II 2C-064-DE-B01|Bipolar disorder]] in particular) - cf. [[Sad mood/Moral pain SD-123|Sad mood]]
*Iatrogenic causes


ADHD is associated with a higher frequency of ''risky behaviour, accidents'' at home/public thoroughfares, criminal and suicidal behaviour'' compared with the general population - cf. [[Suicidal risk 2C-066-IU-A01|suicidal risk]]; [[Suicide, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal 2C-353-DE-A01|suicide]]; [[Accidents in children: knowing the means of prevention 2C-047-PC-A05|accidents in children]]
