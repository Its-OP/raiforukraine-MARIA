'''<u>1) Infection:</u>'''
*Clinical:
**Acute: fever, redness, pain, discharge not the scar, abscess, septic shock.
**Chronic: the clinic is less noisy with pain, recurrent problems healing the surgical approach, fistula with purulent discharge, pseudarthrosis.
*Biology:
**CBC: hyperleukocytosis with PNN and in the case of acute infection, normal or inflammatory anaemia in the case of chronic infection.
**CRP very high in acute infection, close to normal in chronic infection.
**Local bacteriological samples taken during the operation to identify the pathogenic bacteria. Do not take antibiotics indiscriminately before taking bacteriological samples.
*Imaging: not very helpful, but X-rays should be taken systematically to look for secondary displacement, pseudarthrosis and osteosynthesis material rupture.
*Diagnosis is mainly clinical

'''<u>2) Dressing room syndrome</u>''''

*Clinical:
**Intense pain not relieved by analgesics.
**Induration of the affected compartment(s)
**Very painful mobilisation
**Sensory then late motor problems (hypoesthesia of the 1st</sup> commissure in the case of deep fibular nerve damage).
**Preserved pulses
*Biology and imaging: the diagnosis is clinical +++, there are no additional tests to rule out the diagnosis.

'''<u>3) Post-operative nerve palsy</u>''''

*Clinical: systematic neurological examination in postoperative osteosynthesis before discharge. If there is a deficit, determine the sensory territory and carry out motor testing.
*Paraclinical: an electromyogram may be carried out if the deficit persists for more than 3 months.

'''<u>4) Secondary displacement</u>''''

*Clinical: sometimes pain and deformity, often asymptomatic.
*Imaging: post-operative and regular follow-up X-rays, comparison of immediate post-operative X-rays and follow-up X-rays.

'''<u>5) Wound healing disorders:</u>''' clinical diagnosis, prescribe dressing care until complete healing by an IDE.
