A CT scan is the first-line examination to be carried out if there is a clinical neurological contraindication to lumbar puncture:

- Focus sign

- Persistent convulsive seizure

- Glasgow<12

- Signs of cerebral involvement

It eliminates complications (abscess, empyema) and differential diagnoses (thrombophlebitis, subdural effusion, haemorrhage, tumour, stroke).

Cerebral MRI is the key imaging test in cases of suspected cerebral abscess or meningoencephalitis. If herpes encephalitis is suspected, the imaging test should not delay the start of treatment with intravenous aciclovir.
