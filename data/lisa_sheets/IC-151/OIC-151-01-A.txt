Meningitis'' is an inflammation of the meninges, in most cases of infectious origin.

Infectious meningoencephalitis is an inflammation of the meninges and brain.

Bacteria, viruses and, more rarely, fungi or parasites can cause meningitis and meningoencephalitis.

The infectious origin of encephalitis without associated meningitis is rare.

A ''cerebral abscess'' is a collection of pus in the cerebral parenchyma. It may not be associated with meningitis.
