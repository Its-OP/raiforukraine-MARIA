Most viral or bacterial meningitis occurs after colonisation of the airways.

The micro-organisms infect the subarachnoid space after haematogenous transmission.

In the case of viral meningitis, this haematogenous spread can occur during primary infection (type 2 herpes simplex virus) or reactivation.

Contiguous infection is also possible in bacterial meningitis (ENT infection). Direct inoculation of bacteria is possible in postoperative meningitis or in cases of osteomeningeal breach.

Herpetic meningoencephalitis is linked to reactivation of the HSV1 virus in Gasser's lymph nodes, leading to infection of the brain by contiguity.

Cerebral abscesses form:

- by contiguity(>50%)

- by haematogenous diffusion (30%)

- Direct inoculation (post-surgery, trauma)
