'''In the absence of any contraindication to LP:''''

1) Emergency LP and blood cultures

2) If CSF cloudy: dexametasone (DXM) + immediate antibiotic therapy

3) If CSF is clear: wait for cytobiochemistry:

a.    In favour of a bacterial cause: DXM+ antibiotic therapy

b.    In favour of another cause: no treatment (except clear liquid meningoencephalitis)

'''In case of contraindication to LP:'''

1) blood cultures (40 to 60 mL: 2 to 3 pairs, if necessary on a single venipuncture)

2) DXM + antibiotic therapy

3) Cerebral scan if neurological contraindication to LP

4) Correction of non-neurological contraindications to LP (haemodynamic instability, etc.)

5) PL as soon as the contraindication is lifted

In all cases'': adapt antibiotic therapy to microbiological results
