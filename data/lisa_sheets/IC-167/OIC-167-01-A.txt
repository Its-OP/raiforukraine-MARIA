Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. The most common form is hepatic cytolysis, with elevated serum transaminases reflecting hepatocyte necrosis. However, some cases of hepatitis are revealed by cholestasis, or even a mixed cytolytic and cholestatic form.


The first step in the diagnostic process is to determine whether it is acute or chronic hepatitis.

- Acute hepatitis is an acute inflammation of the liver lasting less than 6 months. Transaminases are frequently greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal. This term should only be used if the liver is previously healthy.

- Chronic hepatitis is chronic inflammation of the liver lasting more than 6 months.
