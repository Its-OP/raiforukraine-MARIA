All chronic viral hepatitis can be associated with extrahepatic manifestations. The most common and most difficult to treat is asthenia, sometimes associated with a depressive syndrome.


Extra-hepatic manifestations of HBV


They are numerous but rare:

- Periarteritis nodosa-type vasculitis, which appears early in the course of HBV infection

- There are several types of renal involvement: extra-membranous glomerulonephritis (the most common), membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.


Extra-hepatic manifestations of HCV


- The most common form is mixed cryoglobulinaemia, "with a prevalence of between 20 and 50%". Most cases are asymptomatic. The classic triad is purpura, arthralgia and asthenia.

- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis may also result in "20% of patients".
