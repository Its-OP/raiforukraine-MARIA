'''How is chronic hepatitis diagnosed?'''

In the majority of cases, patients are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, and it is the persistence of disturbances in the liver blood balance for more than six months that suggests the diagnosis.

Transaminase elevations are usually low or moderate, less than five times normal. Associated cholestasis is sometimes present.


Causes of chronic hepatitis


- Alcohol: In France, the leading cause is excessive and chronic alcohol consumption. A "police" interrogation on the mode, type and frequency of consumption should be carried out.

- Metabolic steatosis is the second most common cause. It should be suspected in the presence of metabolic syndrome, particularly diabetes (often incomplete).

- Chronic viral hepatitis B, D and C

- Haemochromatosis: see item 219.

- Autoimmune hepatitis

- rare genetic diseases: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease.



One cause can hide another. Several causes of chronic hepatitis are frequently observed in the same patient. That's why you need to be systematic and look for all these common causes.



What are the signs of seriousness?

The severity of chronic hepatitis is represented by

- The degree of fibrosis, i.e. the degree of fibrous scarring of the liver parenchyma, the ultimate stage of which is cirrhosis

- The degree of activity of the hepatitis, which is not an "immediate" sign of seriousness, but which represents the extent of the inflammation and therefore increases the risk of rapidly reaching a stage of advanced fibrosis.


There are several methods for assessing fibrosis:

- Liver biopsy used to assess a fibrosis score. This method can also be used to assess the histological activity of hepatitis.

- Non-invasive markers: blood markers and measurement of liver elastometry
