'''HAV prevention and vaccination'''


Prevention mainly involves simple hygiene measures such as hand washing and respecting food circuits.

A vaccine is available

Vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended in the following situations:

- People at risk of developing a severe infection (chronic liver disease or cystic fibrosis) or spreading HAV.

- Professionally exposed staff

- People in contact with a diagnosed case

- Travellers to highly endemic countries

- Men who have sex with men



HEV prevention


For genotypes that are transmitted enterically, in hyper-endemic areas, prevention is based on the application of hygiene measures.

For genotypes that are transmitted zoonotically, as in France, prevention is based on informing people at risk who work with animals, on cooking food, and also on screening labile blood products when these are issued to immunocompromised patients.


'''HBV and HDV prevention and vaccination'''


Prevention of HBV is based on 2 principles:

 - The fight against transmission involves the use of condoms, single-use equipment (care and drug addiction) and screening donors (blood, organs).

- Vaccination is the most effective weapon, using a 3-injection vaccination schedule.


Universal vaccination of infants is now compulsory from the second month of life (hexavalent vaccine). Newborns born to mothers with HBV infection are given a sero-vaccination (injection of anti-HBs immunoglobulin in the delivery room, in addition to the vaccination, the first injection of which must be given before leaving the maternity hospital).

It is also necessary to vaccinate adolescents between 11 and 15 years of age who have not been vaccinated, and subjects at high risk of contamination or severe forms of the disease:

- Disabled people living in collective accommodation

- Multiple sexual partners

- Drug users

- Detainees

- Dialysis patients, transfusion recipients, organ transplant candidates, chronic liver disease

- People in contact with acute or chronic hepatitis B


Vaccination is compulsory for staff and students in the healthcare professions to protect both carers and patients.



HCV prevention


HCV prevention is based on 2 principles: the fight against transmission and screening. There is no vaccine.


Combating transmission involves using condoms and single-use equipment (care and drug addiction), and making blood and organ donations safer by screening donors.


Screening must be widely extended because patients can be treated.

High-risk populations (prison inmates, drug addicts, male-male homosexuals) must be screened on a large scale.
