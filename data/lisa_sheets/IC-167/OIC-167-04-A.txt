Apart from a viral infection, elevated transaminases in the blood can have two main causes:

1/ Hepatic causes :

a- Hepatocyte attack linked, in order of frequency, to :

- excess fat (steatohepatitis linked to alcohol or metabolic syndrome)

- a toxic substance (xenobiotic: usually a medicine, more rarely a drug, fungus, food supplement, herbal medicine, etc.)

- genetic iron overload (haemochromatosis)

- a rare cause (autoimmune hepatitis; Wilson's disease, etc.)

Cytolysis :

- Is moderate (< 10 N) in cases of steatohepatitis linked to alcohol or metabolic syndrome, and haemochromatosis;

- May be significant (> 10 N) in cases of toxic, autoimmune, hypoxic (liver shock, Budd-Chiari) or Wilson's disease-related hepatitis.



b- Pressurisation of hepatocytes

- hyperpressure of the biliary system (stone, compression)

- hyperpressure of the suprahepatic venous system (heart failure, thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins, etc.)

- hepatic ischaemia (shock, splanchnic vascular thrombosis (hepatic artery or portal vein)).


2/ Extra-hepatic causes :

Transaminases are also muscle enzymes, and all forms of muscle damage (prolonged exertion, muscle damage, myopathy, myocardial damage) are likely to cause an increase in serum transaminases.
In this case, cytolysis generally predominates over AST and is associated with an increase in CPK.
