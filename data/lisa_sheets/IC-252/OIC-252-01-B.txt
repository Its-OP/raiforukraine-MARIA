'''The nutritional balance is altered during the ageing process, with the following main consequences:'''

*changes in body composition: reduction in muscle mass and increase in fat mass.
*altered appetite regulation;
*exposure to the risk of obesity and malnutrition;

'''The functional consequences of a nutritional imbalance are aggravated by the coexistence:'''

*other markers of ageing, such as sarcopenia and maladaptation to exercise, which contribute to reduced physical activity and appetite,
*co-morbidities and/or treatments that can have an impact on taste and appetite, and encourage hypercatabolism.


'''Undernutrition:'''

*is the consequence of a reduction in intake linked to changes in appetite and physical activity
*is also linked to episodes of hypercatabolism during intercurrent pathologies, leading to an increase in energy expenditure.
*should be sought as part of any overall geriatric assessment and must be identified at an early stage, along with its mechanisms, so that it can be corrected.
***is a co-morbidity and an independent risk factor for poor prognosis (autonomy, falls, infections and death);
***is one of the major causes of vulnerability and frailty in the elderly.
***is one of the causes of iatrogenic dependence (HAS recommendations).
