Eating should remain or return to being a pleasure, and can also be an opportunity to develop social ties.  

Management of undernutrition (renutrition) :

*- must be considered as a therapeutic procedure with the aim of correcting undernutrition
*- must include the patient's opinion and/or that of the patient's family,
*- can and should include ethical considerations, and sometimes multidisciplinary discussions to determine the therapeutic plan
*- must involve all family and professional caregivers (dietician, nursing staff and rehabilitation staff) to encourage eating habits and physical activity.

The strategy for managing undernutrition

9001- Geriatric assessment to understand the context in which undernutrition occurs and in which elderly patient (as in any geriatric approach)'''''

*Comorbidities,
*current treatments,
*dependence,
*socio-environmental context,
*life expectancy and quality of life.

'''''2- Research into and management of all factors that could aggravate/participate in undernutrition'''''

*chronic and acute diseases
*oral and dental conditions, oral fungal infections
*detection of swallowing disorders
*constipation
*Inappropriate diets,
*side effects of medication,
*difficulties with shopping, cooking or eating...

'''3- ''Determine the protein and energy targets and assess the current dietary intake of elderly patients'''''

*energy intake 30 to 40 kcal/kg/day
*protein intake 1.2 to 1.5 g protein/kg/day
*ingesta (number of KCal/day, average over a few days)?

'''4- ''Choice of nutritional management methods, based on the patient's nutritional status and the level of spontaneous energy and protein intake'''''

*in the presence of malnutrition, start with nutritional advice and a fortified diet, and if this fails, use oral nutritional supplements (ONS)
*in the presence of severe malnutrition, start with oral nutritional supplements (ONS)
*then if spontaneous food intake has collapsed (food intake less than 50% of expected intake) or as a second-line treatment if oral nutritional management has failed.
**Enteral nutrition as first-line treatment when the digestive tract is functional.
**Parenteral nutrition, in cases of occlusion, malabsorption or failure of well-managed enteral nutrition.

'''''5- Monitoring ++ (frequency depends on clinical situation, severity of undernutrition)'''''

prevent inappropriate renutrition syndrome

The frequency of monitoring varies according to the clinical situation, the severity of undernutrition and weight trends,

- Weight at the time of any medical consultation, on admission to any hospital, then 1 x/week in short stay and 1 x/15 days in SSR, on admission to an institution (SLD or EHPAD), then 1/month.

- Food intake (ingesta)

- Albumin: recommended unless the initial albumin level is normal, at most once a month, except in special situations.
