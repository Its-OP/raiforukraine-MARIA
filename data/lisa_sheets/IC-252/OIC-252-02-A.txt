The population nutrient reference (PNR) is the daily intake that covers the needs of almost all (97.5%) of the healthy population.

Energy intake 30 kcal/kg/day

Protein intake 1 to 1.2 g/kg/day

Carbohydrate intake 50% of total energy intake

Fat intake 40% of total energy intake

Essential fatty acids 9-10 g/day

Water intake 40 ml/kg/day

Fibre intake 30 g/day

Calcium intake 1 g/day

Vitamin D intake 15 Âµg/day

* A stable weight (apart from hydration problems) means that energy intake is meeting requirements.  
* It seems important to maintain an intake of animal proteins, as their amino acid composition is richer in essential amino acids.
* Half of the daily water requirement is provided by drinks and the other half by food. The intake compensates for water losses of around 1.5 litres per day in urine, 900 ml per day in insensible losses through perspiration and 100 ml per day in faeces.
