'''The risk factors for undernutrition are numerous and often multiple in an elderly patient:'''

* Dependency
* Psycho-socio-environmental factors (bereavement, institutionalization, social isolation, etc.)
* Any symptomatology (including pain) or acute medical or surgical pathology linked to hypercatabolism (such as an inflammatory context) which associates :
** Muscle catabolism (reduction in muscle mass), which represents the primary source of mobilisable energy
** Depletion of lipid reserves (reduction in adipose tissue)
** Changes in carbohydrate metabolism

* Any chronic pathology at a severe stage (cardiac, respiratory, renal and hepatic) but also major neurocognitive disorders, psychiatric pathology (in particular depression) or cancer.
* Any acute situation that makes access to food (impotence) or eating itself (oral problems, swallowing problems or behavioural problems) more difficult.
* Iatrogenic medication (polymedication, dry mouth, dysgeusia, anorexia, somnolence, etc.).
