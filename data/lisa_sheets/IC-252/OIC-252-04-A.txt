Definition of undernutrition: the state of an organism with a nutritional imbalance. Nutritional imbalance is characterised by a negative energy and/or protein balance.

'''<u>Denutrition: presence of at least 1 phenotypic criterion AND at least 1 etiological criterion.</u>'''

'''PHENOTYPIC CRITERIA (1 criterion is enough)'''

- Weight loss ≥ 5% in 1 month OR ≥ 10% in 6 months OR ≥10% from usual weight before onset of illness ;

- BMI<22kg/m2;

- Confirmed sarcopenia.

How to determine the presence of ''SARCOPENIA'': Reduction in ''muscle strength'' (at least 1 criterion: 5 chair lifts or grip strength (dynamometer)) '''AND''' Reduction in '''muscle mass'' (at least 1 criterion: appendicular muscle mass or appendicular muscle mass index in kg/m2 or calf diameter).

'''ETIOLOGICAL CRITERIA (1 criterion is sufficient)'''

- Reduction in food intake ≥ 50% for more than 1 week OR any reduction in intake for more than 2 weeks compared with usual food consumption or protein-energy requirements;

- Reduced absorption (malabsorption/maldigestion) ;

- Pathological situation (with or without inflammatory syndrome): acute pathology (infection, fracture, etc.), or chronic pathology (heart failure, etc.), or progressive malignant pathology.


Once the diagnosis has been made, the severity is assessed:

The criteria for severe undernutrition are as follows (1 criterion is sufficient):

- BMI<20kg/m2;

- Weight loss: ≥10% in 1month OR ≥15% in 6months OR ≥ 15% compared to the usual weight before the onset of the disease ;

- Albuminemia ≤ 30 g/L (with or without inflammatory syndrome).
