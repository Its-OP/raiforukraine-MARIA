The criteria for undernutrition are mainly CLINICAL++.

Certain markers are used:

Albumin :

* Diagnostic criterion for undernutrition (HAS 2007, outside any inflammatory context)
* Robust marker of poor prognosis and mortality.
* Relatively long half-life of 21 days in a stable metabolic situation.
* Levels influenced by inflammation and fluid status.
* Used outside the inflammatory syndrome as a diagnostic criterion for undernutrition (<35 g/L) and severe undernutrition (<30 g/L).
* Should not be monitored more than once a month and is therefore unsuitable for monitoring in acute situations.


Transthyretin (or prealbumin) :

* It is not used in current clinical practice.
* useful for shorter-term nutritional monitoring during nutritional management.
* Very short half-life of 2 days.
* undernutrition suspected from a plasma level < 0.2 g/l.
