The main complications of protein-energy undernutrition in the elderly are :

'''1-Morbi-mortality''''

Undernutrition significantly increases morbidity and mortality. Its presence is a poor prognostic factor in many diseases (cancer, infections, etc.).

By increasing complications in hospital, it increases the length of stay. Undernutrition also increases the risk of institutionalisation for elderly people living at home.

=== '''2-Sarcopenia''' ===
Corresponds to the reduction in muscle mass, strength and function during the ageing process, which is itself associated with reduced mobility, the risk of falling and dependency.

3-Immunodepression

Undernutrition alters cell-mediated immunity, humoral immunity and non-specific immunity, increasing the number and severity of infections, as well as the risk of nosocomial infection.    

4-''Escarres'' (SDD-086): undernutrition increases the risk of bedsores appearing, but can also lead to delayed healing.

5-''Dehydration'''

6- ''Micronutrient deficiencies'' (vitamins B9, B12, and trace elements zinc)
