*If a tumour is suspected by endoscopy (cystoscopy in consultation) or radiology (ultrasound, CT scan, MRI), an endo-vesical resection is essential. Its benefits are :
**Diagnostic: enables a definite anatomopathological diagnosis of the lesions and a description of their histological type.
**Prognostic, as it allows the stage and grade of the tumour to be determined. These 2 elements are essential for :

*Define the risk of recurrence or progression in the case of NMVT (number, size, multifocality, associated CIS).

*Distinguish between NIMV and IMVV according to invasion of the detrusor muscle,
**Therapy: in the case of TVNIM, resection is the only surgical treatment necessary, which may be combined with endo-vesical instillations depending on the risk of progression.
