|Title=Strategy for complementary examinations in urinary cytology and cystoscopy
|Its normality does not exclude the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma and does not dispense with iterative endoscopic controls. Its positivity alerts us to the very probable presence of a urothelial tumour which should be confirmed and located in the urinary excretory tract.

The initial diagnostic work-up is based on two essential tests:

'''la cytologie urinaire :'''

* Search for high-grade urothelial tumour cells on microscopic examination of a urine sample ("smear").
* A normal smear does not exclude the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma.

'''cystoscopy:'''

* Performed as an outpatient or in consultation. It does not allow samples to be taken (biopsies can be taken but cannot replace the tissue removed during resection).
* Endoscopy enables lesions to be visualised and described (annotated diagram).
* It becomes optional when a patient is referred by a GP with an imaging test (ultrasound or CT scan) strongly suggestive of a bladder tumour.
