'''Clinical diagnosis'''' '''([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]], [[Term newborn examination SD-039|Term newborn examination]])''': presence of one or more symptoms from among

- polypnoea: FR > 60/min

- signs of respiratory struggle: flapping of the wings of the nose, thoraco-abdominal rocking, intercostal traction, xyphoid funneling, expiratory whimpering

- cyanosis and/or low oxygen saturation (colour abnormalities of the extremities)

'''Signs of seriousness''' :

- intensity of respiratory distress: Silverman score

- pauses in breathing

- associated haemodynamic disorders

The aetiological diagnosis is guided by the context of birth (risk factors for early bacterial neonatal infection, term of birth, clear or meconium-rich amniotic fluid, diabetes during pregnancy, etc), the time of onset of symptoms and their evolution.), the time to onset of symptoms and their evolution''([[Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation SD-018|Discovery of abnormalities on cardiac auscultation]], [[SDD-020|Discovery of abnormalities on pulmonary auscultation]]''', paraclinical examinations (chest X-ray) '''([[Request for an imaging examination SD-231|Request for an imaging examination]])'''.

Main causes of respiratory distress: early bacterial neonatal infection, delayed resorption of pulmonary fluid, inhalation of meconium fluid, pneumothorax, hyaline membrane disease (premature babies).

Differential diagnosis: cyanogenic heart disease should be suspected in the presence of cyanosis without signs of a struggle, which is unresponsive or only partially responsive to oxygen therapy.
