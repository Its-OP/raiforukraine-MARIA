'''Definition:'''

- Low weight for gestational age or LBW is defined as a weight (estimated in utero weight or birth weight) below the 10th percentile, in isolation. Severe LBW corresponds to a LBW below the 3rd percentile.

- IUGR most often corresponds to PAG associated with arguments in favour of a pathological growth defect: longitudinal growth arrest or inflection (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).

'''Risk factors:''''

1 Foetal pathologies

In 10-20% of cases, IUGR has a foetal cause: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). IUGR tends to be early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and is often associated with morphological abnormalities.

''2.    Vascular pathologies''

They account for 35-50% of IUGR. IUGR most often occurs late (in the 3rd trimester), but can occur early in severe forms. IUGR can recur in subsequent pregnancies.

In the case of IUGR, the arguments in favour of a vascular cause are :

- association with hypertension or even pre-eclampsia ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]]''' and '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''). This association is frequent and very suggestive, but inconstant;

- association with a chronic maternal pathology: chronic ''[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]]''', nephropathy (''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|Increased creatinine]]'''), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications (''[[Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320|Prevention of cardiovascular disease]]''');

- a history of vascular IUGR in a previous pregnancy.

- association with oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid);

- abnormal uterine or umbilical Doppler, reflecting disturbances in maternal-foetal exchanges. These Doppler anomalies result in a quantifiable increase in circulatory resistance in the uterine and/or umbilical arteries (resistance index, pulsatility index) and spectral disturbances.

''3.    Other causes and risk factors''

These are the following factors:

- maternal age < 20 or > 35 ;

- '''[[Malnutrition/malnutrition SD-030|Malnutrition/Denutrition]]'''', low weight gain during pregnancy ;

- low socio-economic level ('''[[Precarious social situation and isolation SD-347|precarious social situation and isolation]]''') ;

- smoking (''''[[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314|prevention of tobacco-related risks]]'''), alcoholism, drug addiction ;

- uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids ('''[[Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-229|Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging examination]]''');

- Placental abnormalities, such as a chorioangioma

- velamentous insertion of the cord which must be systematically sought.

Finally, a third of IUGRs remain poorly explained.
