Refer to the 2017 good practice recommendations: Management of newborns at risk of early bacterial neonatal infection (≥ 34 SA).

'''For a better understanding:'''

* Mother-to-child transmission, usually prenatal, through bacterial colonisation of the genital tract.
* 2 most common bacteria: group B streptococcus (GBS) / Escherichia coli

'''Identifying newborns at risk of INBP'''

1) Maternal colonisation with SGB

2) History of neonatal GBS infection

3) Maternal fever > 38.0°C intrapartum or within 2 hours of delivery

4) Membrane rupture > 12h

5) Spontaneous and unexplained prematurity < 37 SA

6) Antibiotic prophylaxis or inadequate per-partum antibiotic therapy (recommended for situations 1 to 3 regardless of the result of the vaginal swab and in situations 4 and 5 in the case of a positive or unknown vaginal swab).


→ Management : Reinforced clinical surveillance of asymptomatic newborns at risk of INBP, antibiotic therapy to be started if the child becomes symptomatic '''([[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|Prescribe an anti-infective]])''''

'''Identify newborns presenting symptoms of BIN'' (non-specific but should raise the possibility of BIN if present in the first 48 hours) '''([[Examination of the term newborn SD-039|Examination of the term newborn]])'''''

* General signs: fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) or hypothermia (temperature < 36.0°C) '''([[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Hyperthermia/fever]], [[Hypothermia SD-045|Hypothermia]])'''''
* Respiratory signs: respiratory distress (signs of struggle), tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 60/min), apnoea '''([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]])''''
* Haemodynamic signs: tachycardia (> 160 bpm) or bradycardia (< 80 bpm), signs of shock (increased skin recolouration time, pallor, arterial hypotension, oliguria) → signs of severity (Tachycardia, pallor of the child)
* Neurological signs: somnolence, irritability, hypotonia, convulsions → signs of seriousness, must suggest neonatal meningitis '''([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|Coma and consciousness disorders]], Hypotonia / [[Severe malaise of the infant and unexpected death of the infant|malaise of the infant]], [[Convulsions SD-120|Convulsions]])''''
* Digestive signs: refusal to drink, vomiting

→ Management: immediate probabilistic antibiotic therapy after taking a blood culture '''([[Positive blood culture SD-190|Positive blood culture]],''' '''[[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|Prescribe an anti-infective]])''''
