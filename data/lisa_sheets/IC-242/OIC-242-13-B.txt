The majority of thyrotoxicoses can be treated on an outpatient basis following a consultation.

You need to know how to identify the rare emergency situations that require immediate treatment or even hospitalisation:

- '''acute thyrotoxic crisis [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044]] [[Tachycardia SD-166]] [[Diarrhoea SD-002]]''''

- '''Cardiothyreosis''' in an elderly person or one with heart disease [[Palpitations SD-165]] [[Tachycardia SD-166]]

- '''malignant orbitopathy''' [[Diplopia SD-143]]

- ''cachectic form'' in elderly patients or those with another chronic disease

Treatment of hyperthyroidism includes symptomatic treatment of thyrotoxicosis and specific treatment of hyperthyroidism.

[Explaining a treatment to a patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352]]

Symptomatic treatments include :

- rest

- beta-blockers, in particular non-cardioselective beta-blockers (after eliminating any contraindications) to reduce tachycardia and tremors of the extremities

- sedatives or benzodiazepines for behavioural problems such as agitation or incapacitating insomnia

The ''specific treatments for hyperthyroidism'' are :

- synthetic antithyroid drugs, in combination with effective contraception and monitoring of hepatic and haematological tolerance

- total thyroidectomy'' resulting in hypothyroidism, with definitive replacement

- treatment with radioactive iodine, in the absence of contraindication (pregnancy; progressive or severe or very inflammatory orbitopathy)

'''The choice of treatment depends on the cause of the hyperthyroidism'' (Basedow, toxic multinodular goitre, toxic adenoma or hyperthyroidism induced by iodine overload; thyroiditis) '''and the context'' (patient's age, patient's request, desire for pregnancy, drug tolerance).

Graves' disease can occur as a single episode, but the risk of recurrence is 40-60% after well-managed treatment.

'''In pregnant women:''''

- Treatment of Graves' disease during pregnancy requires specialised management to discuss the indication for a low-dose synthetic antithyroid drug, to limit teratogenicity and to determine monitoring procedures, as spontaneous remissions are frequent in the second half of pregnancy.

- The differential diagnosis to be aware of is transient gestational thyrotoxicosis, which is more common than Graves' disease in pregnancy (2% of pregnancies, negative TSH receptor antibodies and occasional hyperthyroidism in the 1st<sup> trimester of pregnancy).
