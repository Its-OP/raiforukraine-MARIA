- Neuropathy due to compression of the optic nerve, which is extremely serious, associated with [[Vision abnormality SD-138|alterations of the visual field]] which can go as far as [[Vision abnormality SD-138|blindness]].

- Involvement of one or more periorbital muscles linked to oedematous phenomena, muscle inflammation and then muscle fibrosis, most often manifested by [[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]].
