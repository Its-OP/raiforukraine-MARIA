Hyperthyroidism can be induced by a single hypersecreting nodule (toxic adenoma) or by a toxic multinodular goitre (several hypersecreting nodules).

It is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism in the elderly.

The diagnostic criteria for a hypersecreting nodule or toxic multinodular goitre therefore include:

- Clinical: a thyrotoxicosis syndrome of variable intensity

- Hormonal profile: peripheral biological hyperthyroidism (low TSH) of variable intensity (= increased or normal T4 and/or T3).

- Ultrasound: a nodule or several nodules on thyroid ultrasound

- Scintigraphy: a single hyperfixing area with extinction of healthy thyroid parenchyma (if single adenoma = toxic adenoma) or alternating hot and cold fixation areas known as a checkerboard pattern (if multiple toxic nodules).
