Hyperthyroidism = excess production of thyroid hormones linked to hyperfunction of the thyroid gland.

Thyrotoxicosis = consequences of excess thyroid hormones in target tissues, whatever the cause:

* release of thyroid hormones, as in De Quervain's sub-acute thyroiditis, for example
* hyperproduction of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland, as in Graves' disease, for example
* exogenous supply of thyroid hormones (factitious thyrotoxicosis).
