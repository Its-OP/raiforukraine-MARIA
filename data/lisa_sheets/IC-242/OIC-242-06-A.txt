TSH = [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of diagnostic test SD-178|first-line test]] :

- Always collapsed in cases of peripheral hyperthyroidism.

- If TSH is low, second-line T4L assay to assess the severity of thyrotoxicosis.

- Determination of T3L, if T4L is normal, to look for T3 hyperthyroidism.

A distinction is made between frust or sub-clinical thyroid disease (with normal peripheral hormones) and frank thyroid disease (with elevated peripheral hormones).
