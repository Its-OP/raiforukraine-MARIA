The diagnosis of Graves' disease is based on the measurement of TSH receptor antibodies. A high titre confirms the diagnosis (specific biological signs).

The non-specific biological signs are :

- lower cholesterol and triglyceride levels (depending on previous figures)

- discreet [[Hyperglycaemia SD-208|hyperglycaemia]] (sometimes) and, above all, aggravation of associated diabetes.

- elevated liver enzymes

- leukoneutropenia with relative lymphocytosis
