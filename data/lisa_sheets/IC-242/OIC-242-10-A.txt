The diagnosis of Graves' disease should be clinically evoked when there is an association of '''hyperthyroidism''' with '''orbitopathy''' (SFE 2016 consensus).

In the absence of orbitopathy, it is based in 1st<sup>Ã¨re</sup> intention on the '''dosage plasmatique positive anti TSH receptor antibodies'''.

In the event of clinical suspicion of Graves' disease, if the concentration of TSH receptor antibodies is not high or if it is not possible to measure the antibodies in plasma, a thyroid scintigraphy should be performed as a second-line treatment. This shows diffuse and homogeneous hyperfixation of the isotope, characteristic of Graves' disease.

Thyroid ultrasound-doppler can be useful for diagnosis, as a complement to antibody assays or as an alternative to scintigraphy in the case of pregnancy, showing an overall hypoechoic gland with often diffuse hypervascularisation.
