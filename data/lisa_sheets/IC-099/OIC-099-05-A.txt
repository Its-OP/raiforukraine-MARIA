- '''Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF)''' : leader of the ''[[Céphalée SD-118|céphalées]] trigémino-autonomiques''' (CTA) = strict unilateral character of the pain and presence of dysautonomic signs.

- AVF seizures: strictly unilateral periorbital seizures, very intense but short < 3 hours, with trigemino-autonomic symptoms and characteristic motor agitation.

- Migraine-like" signs, [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]]/[[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], photo and phonophobia often present, should not mislead the diagnosis.

- Attacks occur daily, but more often than not at different times of the year.

<br />

*''Episodic AVF'': in 90% of patients, attacks occur for periods of a few weeks to a few months. There is sometimes a circadian cycle (seizures occur at fixed times, especially at night) and a circannual cycle (in the same season), as well as a link with alcohol consumption.

<blockquote>
*'''Chronic AVF''': in 10% of cases, attacks recur over the long term with no remission of more than three; this is then chronic AVF, a fearsome disease burdened with significant psychiatric comorbidity: depressive signs, agoraphobia and suicidal tendencies.
