Migraine with aura is an independent risk factor for cerebral infarction. The risk is doubled in a person suffering from migraine with aura and increases in the case of cofactors (female sex, age under 45, smoking and oestroprogestogenic contraception).

'''In practice: Before prescribing oral contraception, systematically look for a migraine, and determine whether it is without aura or with aura'''.

''Then, look for all arterial risk factors''

o Age> 35

o Smoking

o Family history of stroke or myocardial infarction

o [[Hypertension SD-042|Hypertension]]

o Dyslipidaemia

o Obesity

'''Then choose contraception according to vascular risk factors and type of migraine'''

Migraine without aura

o ''Absence of any arterial risk factor'': all types of contraception are possible, including oestroprogestins

o ''If one or more arterial risk factors are present'': oestroprogestogenic oral contraceptives are contraindicated; pure progestogens are possible, as are other methods of contraception.

'''Migraine with aura:''' oestroprogestogenic oral contraceptives are contraindicated; pure progestogens are possible, as are other methods of contraception.
