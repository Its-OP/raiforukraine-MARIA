Worldwide, 50 to 75% of adults have had at least one [[Headache SD-118|headache]] in the previous twelve months. Most of these are tension headaches or migraines.


Tension headache

o Episodic (<15 days per month) 50-70% of the population depending on the country.

o Chronic (≥15 days per month) 1-2% of adults

o Often begins in adolescence and affects 3 women for every 2 men.

o Less disabling than migraine.


'''Migraine'''

o Episodic (<15 days/month) 12% of adults, with a peak between the ages of 35 and 39, with 30% of women and 15% of men affected in this age group.

o 7% of pre-pubescent children, with no difference between the sexes.

o Chronic (≥ 15 days/month) affects 1.7% of adults in France.

o Often begins at puberty, affecting 2 women for every 1 man.

o Often runs in families and is responsible for considerable disability.


'''Algie vasculaire de la face (AVF)'''

o Affects 1 in 1000 people.

o Starts in young adults (around 30) and affects 4-5 men for every 1 woman.

o Includes an episodic form and a chronic form

o Leads to a major disability


'''Drug-induced headache (it is a chronic daily headache)'''

o 1 to 5% of adults, depending on the country, complication of migraine or tension headache


'''Individual and societal impact of primary headaches:''' they have a significant individual and societal impact, not only because of the pain, but also because of the disability they cause, the reduction in quality of life and the direct costs (linked to care) or indirect costs (linked to absenteeism).


'''→'''According to the WHO, '''primary headache disorders are underestimated''', poorly recognised and inadequately treated throughout the world.

'''→'''Migraine is the most disabling neurological disease''' and causes more disability than all other neurological diseases combined. This '''disability is invisible and often unrecognised.''
