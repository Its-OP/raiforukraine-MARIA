The diagnostic approach is detailed in ''item 100''. In the absence of biological or radiological markers, the diagnosis is clinical, based on questioning using the diagnostic criteria of the ICHD (International Classification of Headache Disorders) and a normal clinical examination. ([[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]] ; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]] ; [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]])


'''Rule out a secondary headache'''

Questioning identifies any acute, recent and unusual [[Headache SD-118|Headache]], which must be considered secondary and explored rapidly. It looks for the red flags that immediately raise suspicion of a serious cause (''item 100)''. A diagnosis of primary headache should not be made during a first episode. The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches (apart from the dysautonomic signs of an AVF attack).

'''Specify the type of primary headache'''

Once it has been established that the patient is consulting us for habitual, long-standing headaches (''for at least 3 months'', often much longer), the questioning takes place in 5 stages.

The clinical examination is normal in primary headaches.

- The characteristics of the headache help to make the diagnosis (''item 100''). The temporal profile is very important: duration of attacks without treatment; number of headache days per month; duration of headaches without treatment.

o ''Headache < 15 days/month'': the main causes are episodic migraine and episodic tension headache.

o '''Headache â‰¥ 15 days/month:''' chronic daily headache (CCQ). A distinction is made between :

*''Short-term QCC'' (attacks <4 hours): facial vascular algesia and trigeminal neuralgia;
*''Long-term QCC'' (>4 hours): chronic migraine or, more rarely, chronic tension headache, both with or without drug abuse. The pain may be permanent, from waking up to going to bed, and may continue into the night.
