'''<u>Essential trigeminal neuralgia (classic or idiopathic</u>)''''

- '''Pain''': Very intense, searing, lightning-like or electric discharge, of very short duration (a few seconds). The patient briefly stands still in a painful attitude.

- '''Topography''': unilateral and strictly localised:

o in the trigeminal area (but not beyond) ;

o single-branch (maxillary V2: 40%, maxillary V3: 20%, ophthalmic V1: 10%); or double-branch.

- '''Triggering factors''': pain triggered electively by excitation of a specific area of skin in the painful territory, the '''trigger zone'''. A light touch is enough. Attacks can be triggered by speech, mimicry, laughter or chewing, so the patient tries to keep a still face and eat as little as possible.

- '''Clinical examination:'''

o ''Normal in classical and idiopathic neuralgia'': facial and corneal sensitivity (corneal reflex present), strength of masticatory muscles (innervated by the V motor) normal, absence of any neurological damage, normal skin.

o The presence of the slightest abnormality (hypoesthesia, motor damage to the V3 branch) points to "secondary neuralgia".

'''<u>Trigeminal neuralgia or secondary trigeminal neuropathic pain</u>''''

- When pain is localised to the V territory, the aim is to rule out secondary neuralgia (due to a cause other than a vascular-nervous impingement) or secondary painful neuropathy.

- '''Secondary neuralgia''': pain in the form of an electric discharge, with a trigger zone. Sometimes the clinical examination is strictly normal, which is why an MRI scan is necessary for any trigeminal neuralgia ([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]).

- '''Secondary trigeminal neuropathic pain''': the pain is of the continuous burning type, sometimes with additional discharges.

- '''Red flags''': A secondary cause must be evoked when :

o a young age of onset (MS),

o less intense discharges (painful neuropathy),

o a preponderance in the V1 territory (shingles?),

o a painful background with paresthesia and hypoesthesia (painful neuropathy)

o clinical abnormality: hypoesthesia, reduced corneal reflex, V3 motor damage (masseter, pterygoid) and/or damage to other cranial nerves on the same side.

- '''[[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|Investigations]]'''': A cerebral MRI with thin sections of the brainstem and trigeminal nerve along its entire course (with gadolinium injection) is imperative, along with a biological work-up and sometimes a lumbar puncture.
