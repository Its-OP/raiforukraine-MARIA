Idiopathic facial pain is chronic pain without local causes, often associated with anxiety and/or depression, due to loss of central inhibition of pain circuits.

In the absence of a local cause, and before concluding that it is an AVF, a migraine with facial expression, or trigeminal neuralgia, serious causes must be sought and ruled out, particularly in adults aged over 50 and in the presence of a deterioration in general condition.

* ENT tumour pathology (sinus, nasopharyngeal cavity, parotid tumours)
* Temporal arteritis
* Other vasculitis
* Carotid dissection
* Chin nerve neuropathy: investigations often reveal a malignant tumour.
* Facial pain and lung cancer'': severe facial pain may reveal an ipsilateral lung tumour (invasion or compression of the pneumogastric nerve, X nerve).
