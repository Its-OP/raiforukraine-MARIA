'''<u>1.  Identify possible factors favouring a migraine</u>'''

- '''Triggers:''' factors which, singly or in combination, trigger attacks in a migraine sufferer. Most patients describe several triggers. The common denominator is a ''change'', either intrinsic (endogenous) or extrinsic (exogenous):

o Modifying meals and hydration (timing, quantity and/or quality)

o Changes to sleep patterns (quality, duration, wake-up and bedtimes)

o Climate changes (atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity)

o Hormonal changes (catamenial period, resumption of post-partum migraines)

o Intense and unusual physical effort

o Negative emotions (anger, annoyance) or positive emotions (birthdays, weddings)

o Stress and periods of relaxation (weekends, holidays)

o Pharmacological triggers (alcohol, phosphodiesterase inhibitors)

- '''The real triggers are often obvious (alcohol, catamenial period)'''

- '''Hygienic and dietetic rules:''' for patients with an unfavourable lifestyle, but these rules ''will never cure the migraine''.

- Unnecessary avoidance of real or supposed triggers can reduce quality of life and even increase sensitivity to triggers, making migraine worse.


'''<u>2.  Identify and prevent possible risk factors for progression to chronic migraine (Table)</u>''''

Migraine ''comorbidities'' are conditions that are more prevalent in migraine sufferers than in control subjects: anxiety, depression, [[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|sleep disorders]], asthma, [[Chronic pain SD-035|chronic pain]] non-headache, cardiovascular disease. These co-morbidities and other risk factors (Box) increase the risk of an episodic migraine developing into a chronic migraine. Treating them can help to improve migraine. They should therefore be ''screened for and prevention and/or treatment offered''.

- The most important ''modifiable risk factors'' for progression to ''chronic migraine'' are :

*- '''High frequency of headaches at the base: to be monitored using the seizure diary''' *- '''Depression:'' to be screened using the HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression).
*- Depression: to be screened using the HAD scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression).
*- ''Overuse of crisis treatment'': to be monitored using the diary.
