'''<u>1.  Treatment of the migraine attack</u>'''

- '''Molecules of proven efficacy''<nowiki>: non-specific treatments (paracetamol, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and specific treatments (triptans) (table). (</nowiki>[[Prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) SD-249|prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]]; [[Prescribing analgesics SD-250|prescribing analgesics]])

- Paracetamol, often used as a self-medication, is only effective for mild to moderate attacks.

- NSAIDs: Ibuprofen and ketoprofen have marketing authorisation for the treatment of migraine attacks. Naproxen, diclofenac and indometacin have also been shown to be effective.

- Triptans: Specific anti-migraine drugs. These serotonin 5HT1B/1D receptor agonists are vasoconstrictors and are contraindicated in patients with a history of vascular disease. The dosage is one unit at the start of an attack, to be repeated in the event of a recurrence (maximum 2 per day).

- '''Metoclopramide''': relieves digestive problems in cases of nausea/vomiting.

- Do not prescribe opiates because of the risk of drug abuse, addiction and increased digestive problems. Avoid combined analgesics (caffeine) as they increase the risk of drug abuse.

- '''Prescription and advice''' [[Writing a prescription/medical letter SD-342|(writing a prescription/medical letter]]; [[Explaining a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explaining a treatment to the patient]])

o Advise taking it "early", within one hour of the onset of the mild to moderate headache, for no more than 8 days a month (to prevent drug abuse).

o ''If paracetamol fails, prescribe a triptan and an NSAID on the same prescription'', depending on the drugs already tried and the patient's preferences, and explain the ''strategy''.

§ Mild crisis'': take the NSAID then the triplan if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.

§ '''Moderate crisis''' '''or severe crisis''': take triptan then NSAID if relief is insufficient after 1 hour.

§ Seizure with aura: take the NSAID as soon as the aura starts and the triptan as soon as the headache starts.

o Prescribe a combination of paracetamol and metoclopramide to patients with a contraindication to or intolerance of NSAIDs, aspirin and triptans.

o Prescribe metoclopramide (oral, rectal or injectable) for digestive disorders

- '''Follow-up and optimisation of crisis treatment (after at least 3 crises)''' '''<u>2.  Background treatment of migraine</u>'''

- '''Traditional oral treatments:''' several have proven efficacy in episodic migraine, with a high level of evidence (amitriptyline, flunarizine, metoprolol, pizotifen, propranolol, topiramate and sodium valproate) or a lower level of evidence (lisinopril, candesartan, atenolol, bisoprolol, timolol, oxetorone, venlafaxine). Only topiramate has proven efficacy in the prevention of chronic migraine.

- Antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway'': three anti-CGRP antibodies injected SC have marketing authorisation in France for the prophylaxis of migraine with at least 8 migraine days per month and failure of at least 2 prior disease-modifying treatments. They can only be prescribed by a neurologist. In 2021, these costly treatments were not yet reimbursed.

- Botulinum toxin: proven effective in chronic migraine, but not episodic migraine. Approved after failure of at least two disease-modifying treatments, as an alternative to anti-CGRP antibodies. It will be administered in hospital only.


- '''Indication for background treatment:''' Determined on the basis of patient preferences, the diary, any criteria for severe migraine and chronic migraine, and the impact assessed using the HIT-6 and HAD scales. It is ''recommended to initiate a background treatment'' in patients with frequent and/or disabling attacks, and in all patients.

o Using seizure medication 8 days or more per month for > 3 months

o Having severe migraine according to French definition criteria

o Having chronic migraine according to ICHD-3 criteria

o With a HIT-6 score of 60 or more

o Having disabling migraine attacks despite optimised crisis treatment


- '''Objectives of background treatment to be explained to the patient'''

o The aim is to reduce monthly headache days by 50% in episodic migraine and 30% in chronic migraine.

o Efficacy is assessed during the 3rd month of treatment.

o Failure of disease-modifying therapy may be due to ineffectiveness and/or intolerance.


- '''Prescription of the first background treatment:''' Start at a low dose and gradually increase to reach the optimal daily dose, taking into account the side-effects.

o Explain that compliance is vital and encourage once-daily dosing if possible.

o ''Episodic migraine'': ''propranolol'' or ''metoprolol'' as first-line treatment and where beta-blockers, amitriptyline, candesartan or topiramate are contraindicated.

o ''Chronic migraine: topiramate'' as first-line treatment, specialist advice is recommended.

o ''Chronic migraine'' with a ''drug-induced headache''.

§ Prescribe a first-line background treatment

§ Advise the patient to wean off the over-used medication on an outpatient basis.

§ Prescribe another seizure treatment to manage rebound headache and residual seizures, with advice to aim for 8 days of treatment per month.

- '''Assessment and monitoring of background treatment:'''

o Seizure diary and HIT-6 scale to assess the effectiveness of background treatment, which must be taken regularly for 3 months before being evaluated.

o If effective, it is continued for 6 to 18 months.

o If this fails, a new treatment should be tried. The choice of drug depends on the patient's condition, co-morbidity and the severity of the migraine, taking into account the benefit/risk balance.

o ''After failure of two disease-modifying treatments'', specialist advice is recommended (neurologist).

- '''Non-drug background treatment: '''

o '''Physical exercise''''

o '''Acupuncture''''

o '''Psycho-behavioural treatments'''


'''<u>3.  Management of migraine during pregnancy</u>''''

- '''Reassure''': migraine is not associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and pregnancy often leads to remission of attacks.

- '''Inform''': the treatments offered follow the recommendations of the Teratogen Reference Centre (CRAT), accessible to all on <nowiki>https://lecrat.fr</nowiki>

- '''Crisis treatments:'''

o ''Paracetamol'' as first-line treatment

o '''Triptans''': if paracetamol fails, sumatriptan may be used regardless of the term. If sumatriptan fails, 2 other triptans are authorised (rizatriptan and zolmitriptan).

o ''NSAIDs'': ''formally contraindicated from the 24th SA'' (risk of non-closure of the ductus arteriosus), very occasional use during the first two trimesters if necessary.

- '''Background treatments:'''

o ''Non-drug background treatment'' as first-line treatment (see above)

o ''Background drug treatment:'' this is discussed on a case-by-case basis, and will be based on a beta-blocker (propranolol, metoprolol) or amitriptyline.
