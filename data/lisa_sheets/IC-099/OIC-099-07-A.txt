A patient may have two types of primary [[Headache SD-118|headache]] intertwined, most commonly a migraine without aura and an episodic tension headache.

In the case of CCQ (> 15 days per month of headaches), if the patient has migraines and tension headaches, the diagnosis of migraine takes precedence, and a chronic migraine must be diagnosed as soon as there are 8 days per month (2 days per week) of headache of a migrainous nature.
