The '''clinical signs''' suggestive of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) are:

- myodesopsias followed by phosphenes corresponding to the onset of retinal tearing

- amputation of the peripheral visual field, corresponding to the formation of the DR

- when the DR lifts the macula, it causes a drop in visual acuity (white, painless eye).

'''Fundus examination''' with examination of the peripheral retina enables:

*make the diagnosis: the retina appears raised, mobile, forming voluminous folds
*search for the causal tear: the surgeon must try to find several tears, as multiple tears are common and failure to identify one or more tears may lead to failure of the surgical treatment.
