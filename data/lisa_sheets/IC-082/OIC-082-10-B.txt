Damage to the optic nerve is responsible for a unilateral drop in visual acuity, with impairment of the photomotor reflex and damage to the visual field (scotoma).

The recent onset of papilledema requires urgent brain imaging to rule out any intracranial expansive process.

=="Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NOIA)" ==
NOIA is characterised by the following:

*mostly elderly patients
*sudden, painless, unilateral decrease in visual acuity, usually massive
*decrease in direct photomotor reflex
*total or sectorial papilloedema
*fascicular deficit on visual field examination

The most common cause is arteriosclerosis, but NOIA should be systematically investigated for Horton's disease, which requires urgent systemic corticosteroid therapy.

==Retrobulbar optic neuritis (NORB) ==
NORB is characterised by the following:

*young patients (20-40 years)
*rapidly progressive decrease in visual acuity over a few hours to a few days, usually unilateral.
*very frequent eye pain, increased by eye movements;
*When the affected eye is illuminated, the direct photomotor reflex is reduced, as is the consensual reflex in the healthy eye.
*When the healthy eye is illuminated, an afferent pupillary deficit (Marcus Gunn pupil) on the affected side is demonstrated: alternating illumination of the pupils in the dark reveals paradoxical dilation of the pupil on the affected side.
*normal fundus examination (more rarely, moderate papilledema)
*central or caecocentral scotoma on visual field examination
*Colour vision examination typically shows dyschromatopsia with a red-green axis.
*Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) are very impaired in the acute stage. On the healthy contralateral eye, they may show a lengthening of latency times, reflecting a slowing of conduction suggestive of demyelination lesions.

The risk of developing multiple sclerosis after an isolated episode of optic neuropathy is 30% on average at 5 years. The main risk factors are :

*the presence of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the time of the first examination
*intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.

==Toxic and metabolic optic neuropathies ==
What these neuropathies have in common is that they are manifested by bilateral and progressive damage.

They are dominated by four causes:

*Alcohol-induced optic neuropathy: favoured by associated smoking, and is often referred to as alcohol-induced optic neuropathy. It typically presents on examination of the visual field with a bilateral cecocentral scotoma. In the absence of withdrawal, it leads to the development of optic atrophy.

*drug-induced optic neuropathy: observed mainly during treatment for tuberculosis (ethambutol and isoniazid). They can cause a permanent reduction in visual acuity, hence the need for regular systematic monitoring of patients treated by examination of the visual field and above all colour vision, as these optic neuropathies are revealed early by red-green dyschromatopsia.
*occupational optic neuropathies (e.g. lead);
*metabolic optic neuropathies: in particular diabetes.

=='''Tumoral optic neuropathies'''==
These are:

*intraorbital tumours of any kind: tumours of the optic nerve (glioma) or its sheaths (meningioma), compression of the optic nerve by an intraorbital tumour. They most often result in optic atrophy associated with exophthalmos.
*tumours of the anterior part of the skull (sphenoid meningioma, etc.).

==Papilloedema ==
The papilla is hyperhaemic, with blurred edges.

- Unilateral papilledema, with reduced visual acuity, suggests a vascular cause, particularly if associated with flare haemorrhages.

- Bilateral papilledema with no loss of visual acuity suggests intracranial hypertension or severe arterial hypertension.
