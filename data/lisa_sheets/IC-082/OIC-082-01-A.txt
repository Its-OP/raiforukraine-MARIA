'''Anamnesis:''' assess the subjective sensation of mono- or binocularity of the disorder, and its laterality if monocular

'''On examination:''' when assessing visual acuity without and then with optical correction, a well-performed occultation of one eye and then the other enables the mono- or binocular nature of the visual disorder to be determined.

A visual problem is binocular if it disappears when either eye is occluded, and is only perceived when both eyes are open.

A visual disturbance is monocular when it persists after occlusion of the healthy eye.
