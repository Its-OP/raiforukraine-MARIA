== '''Occlusion of the central retinal artery (OACR)''' ==
CRAO results in the following:[[File:CRAO.jpg|thumb]]

*Sudden, very profound drop in visual acuity (light perception)
*Pupil in areflectic mydriasis
*On fundus examination: diffuse narrowing of the arterial calibre, ischaemic white retinal oedema of the retina with cherry-red staining of the macula.
*Clinical picture varies according to the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal artery.

The younger the patient, the more exhaustive the aetiological work-up. The causes can be classified into several broad classes according to the mechanism involved:

*embolisms: carotid atheroma, the most frequent cause, emboligenic heart disease.
*thrombosis: Horton's disease and systemic diseases, in particular systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener's disease, Takayashu disease, Kawasaki disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome.
*coagulation disorders.

Aetiological assessment and treatment of arterial occlusion must be carried out at the same time, ''as a matter of urgency, if possible in a neurovascular unit''. The search for a curable embolic cause is crucial to avoid the recurrence of emboli in the cerebral territory.

The "treatment" is similar in many respects to that for ischaemic strokes:

*In all cases, treatment with oral or intravenous aspirin is instituted.
*Only in the case of RCAO in a young patient in good general condition, seen within the first 6 hours, should maximum treatment be considered (Diamox®, IV vasodilators, fibrinolytics) to achieve rapid repermeabilisation.
*long-term treatment depends on the aetiological assessment: carotid atheroma (antiplatelet therapy), cardiac emboli whose cause could not be controlled (e.g. atrial fibrillation: antivitamin K), significant carotid stenosis (endarterectomy).

== Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) ==
CRVO is characterised by the following:

*Decrease in visual acuity, which varies greatly depending on the clinical form.
*On fundus examination: papilledema, disseminated retinal haemorrhages, cottony nodules, venous tortuosity and dilatation.
*Clarification of the clinical form of venous occlusion by fundus examination and fluorescein angiography: ischaemic or non-ischaemic form;
*Variable clinical picture depending on the location of the occlusion in the case of occlusion of a branch of the central retinal vein.

In patients aged over 50, the ''etiological work-up'' is therefore usually as simple as possible:

*to look for risk factors: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia;
*as well as looking for ocular hypertonia or chronic glaucoma.

In cases of RVCO in patients under 50 years of age or bilateral RVCO, a work-up for a primary coagulation abnormality is necessary (activated protein C resistance, protein C, protein S or antithrombin deficiency).

Non-ischaemic forms" in half of cases have a favourable outcome, with normalisation of visual acuity and fundus appearance in 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the outcome is less favourable:

*either by the transition to an ischaemic form (about a quarter of cases);
*the persistence of cystoid macular oedema (CMO), responsible for a permanent drop in visual acuity.

Ischaemic forms'', either immediately or secondarily, have a much more severe prognosis. The AV is immediately collapsed, usually less than 1/20, with no hope of functional recovery due to the major macular ischaemia.

The development of iris neovascularisation is the most serious complication of ischaemic RVC because of the risk of rapid progression to "neovascular glaucoma" (NVG, 100-day glaucoma).

The aim of ''treating'' a CRVO is mainly to prevent or treat complications: macular oedema, by means of intravitreal injections; neovascular complications, by means of laser treatment in order to avoid progression to GNV.

No medical treatment has proved effective in the management of retinal vein occlusions. Non-ischaemic forms may benefit from treatment with isovolaemic haemodilution, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated.

Treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is indicated in the presence of CMO with reduced visual acuity. In all cases, clinical and angiographic monitoring every month from the outset will enable early detection of the transition to an ischaemic form. For ischaemic forms, laser retinal panphotocoagulation (RPP) should be performed immediately when the ischaemia is very extensive, without waiting for the appearance of iris neovascularisation. If a GNV has already developed, PPR should be performed as a matter of urgency, after lowering ocular tone with local hypotonising treatment and acetazolamide (Diamox®) per os or intravenously. In the most serious cases, surgery may be required in order to hypotonise the eye.
