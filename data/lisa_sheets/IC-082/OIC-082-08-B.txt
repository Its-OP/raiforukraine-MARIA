Complementary examinations are not systematic and are guided by the interview and clinical examination:

*additional ophthalmological tests
*additional non-ophthalmological examinations: whether biological or radiological, these are guided by the initial diagnosis.

The main additional tests available to guide diagnosis and management in ophthalmology are :

- Goldman visual fields (kinetic perimetry) or automated static perimetry: to be requested in cases of glaucoma, neuro-ophthalmological pathology or unexplained drop in visual acuity;

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT): indicated in cases of macular anomaly at the back of the eye (drusen, haemorrhage, vitreomacular traction, macular hole, epimacular membrane, etc.). It is increasingly requested as part of the pre-operative cataract assessment. OCT may also be centred on the optic nerve head and indicated in cases of glaucoma or neuro-ophthalmological pathology;

- the'''<nowiki/>'fluorescein angiography'''<nowiki>: indicated in cases of retinal pathology (age-related macular degeneration [AMD], diabetes, central retinal vein occlusion [CRVO], central retinal artery occlusion [CRCAO], etc.);</nowiki>

- l''''angiography with indocyanine green''' (ICG): indicated in cases of AMD or inflammatory pathology of the posterior segment (posterior uveitis);

- l''''électrophysiologie visuelle''' (electrorétinogram [ERG], electro-oculogram [EOG], visual evoked potentials [PEV]): the ERG and EOG are useful for diagnosing retinal dystrophies, while the PEV are useful for diagnosing optic neuropathies.

- L'''' ocular ultrasound''': in A mode, its main purpose is to assess the length of the eyeball (in particular to determine the power of the implant during cataract surgery in patients with a very dense cataract); in B mode, its main indication is to detect a possible retinal detachment in the event of an ocular media disorder (cataract or vitreous haemorrhage), or to locate an intraocular foreign body or help diagnose an intraocular or intraorbital tumour.
