An ophthalmic migraine or visual migraine aura is characterised by the appearance of visual stimuli which subside in about 15 to 20 minutes, usually giving way to a pulsatile headache, usually in the hemicranium and contralateral. In some cases, the scintillating scotoma is isolated, with no headache.

The stimuli most often reported are a bilateral scintillating scotoma, accompanied by coloured flashes, progressively extending to one visual hemifield. However, some patients report a wide variety of visual stimuli. The diagnosis is confirmed by repetition, a normal clinical examination and any associated headache.
