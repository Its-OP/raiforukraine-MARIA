Amaurosis fugax is an acute onset of total visual loss lasting a few minutes and resolving spontaneously. It corresponds to a ''transient ischaemic attack of the retina''.

It is a diagnostic ''emergency'' because of the risk of a ''constituted retinal artery occlusion or ischaemic stroke''.

Carotid atheroma or embolism cardiopathy should be sought first. Horton's disease should also be systematically considered.
