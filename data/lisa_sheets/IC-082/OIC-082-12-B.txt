A migraine aura must be differentiated from other transient visual disorders: transient monocular blindness, phosphenes.

'''Neurological differential diagnoses:''''

- transient ischaemic attacks (in rare cases accompanied by positive visual phenomena resembling migraine aura)

- partial occipital epilepsy

- symptomatic migraines (secondary to a neurological cause, such as intracerebral vascular malformations)


'''Ocular differential diagnoses:''' processes that can produce positive visual phenomena such as photopsia or myodesopsia

- retinal tear, posterior vitreous detachment, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment

- vitreous haemorrhage

- posterior uveitis (hyalitis, retinal lesions)
