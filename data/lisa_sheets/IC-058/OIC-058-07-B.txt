Psychiatric disorders can be associated with all sexual dysfunctions (disorders of desire, arousal, orgasm, ejaculation and sexual disorders with pain):

* mood disorders: characterised depressive episode (see Item 66a) or bipolar disorder (see Item 64) ;
* anxiety disorders (see Items 66);
* psychotic disorders (see Items 63 and 65);
* eating disorders (see Item 71);
* substance use disorders, in particular alcohol, cocaine, heroin, cannabis and also sexual stimulants (poppers, GHB, testosterone, amphetamine derivatives, ecstasy/MDMA, cathiones, mephedrone derivatives, propofol, etc.) (see Items 75 to 80).


Psychological factors can also alter sexual response:

* unfavourable relational context, communication difficulties
* altered self-image (after surgery, for example)
* trauma: traumatic sexual experience, abuse as a child, etc.
* low level of sexual education (e.g. false beliefs about sexuality, taboos, etc.)
