'''<big>Sexuality involves four components and their interactions enable the achievement of a fulfilled sexuality.</big>''''

<br />

=='''The couple:'''==

*A place to express sexuality
*An essential reassuring and caring space: the notion of emotional security
*Dysfunctions within the couple can limit the development of sexuality

=='''Anatomical and functional integrity:'''==

*Sequence of physiological events essential for the emergence and development of the sexual response.
*Anatomical or functional alterations can affect the emergence and/or sequence of these physiological sequences and alter the sexual response, thereby limiting sexual fulfilment.
*We will be looking in particular for cardiovascular, neurological, endocrine, iatrogenic, urological and gynaecological disorders (gynaeco-obstetric history, search for possible female genital mutilation, etc).

=='''Psychological factors:'''==
- Identify the psychological factors that can alert the sexual response:

- representations of patients, their gender and sexuality

- sexual development (traumatic events),

- sexual attitudes and practices,

- positive stress factors (childbirth, etc.) or negative stress factors (bereavement, unemployment, infertility, etc.)

==''The environment:'''==

*Sexuality takes place in a composite social, economic, political, historical, ethical, legal, spiritual and religious context.
*Contextual norms and constraints can directly influence how sexuality is achieved.
