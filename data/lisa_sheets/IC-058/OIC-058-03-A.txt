A sexual disorder is considered a dysfunction if it is :

- present for at least 6 months and in at least 75% of cases for most disorders

- responsible for suffering, personal and/or relational distress

The disorder may be temporary or long-standing, acquired or not, generalised and/or situational.

Sexual dysfunctions correspond to :

* desire disorders ;
* arousal disorders
* orgasm disorders;
* ejaculation disorders;
* sexual pain

== ''''' Desire disorders''''' '''''(anaphrodisia)''''' ==

* Decreased or absent sexual desire and interest in all forms: coitus, fondling, masturbation.
* Normal genital examination.
* Primary or secondary (having already experienced desire)
* Variable intensity:
** "transient decrease in desire": repeated absence of imaginative sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity.
** aversion to some or all sexual activity.

== ''''' Excitement disorders''''' ==
In men, these correspond to erectile dysfunction (see item 126 - Erectile dysfunction): difficulty obtaining or maintaining an erection until the end of sexual activity or a decrease in the rigidity of the erection. One in three men experience erectile dysfunction after the age of 40, with age being an independent risk factor for erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction is a sentinel symptom of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary artery disease.

In women, they correspond to intumescence or a lack of vaginal lubrication. They can cause sexual pain (dyspareunia).

== '''''Orgasm disorders''''' ==
● Absence or delay of orgasm after a normal phase of sexual desire and arousal :

● Anorgasmia: absence of orgasm

● Hypo-orgasmia: reduced intensity or difficulty reaching orgasm

● Dysorgasmia: pain during orgasm

== '''''Ejaculation disorders''''' ==

=== Anejaculation ===
● Absence of sperm emission from the urethral meatus

● Whether or not associated with an orgasm disorder

=== Premature ejaculation ===
Defined by :

● a delay between penile intromission and ejaculation of less than 1 minute

● and an inability to delay ejaculation

● and, a feeling of dissatisfaction or frustration on the part of one of the two partners

● Most frequent male sexual dysfunction (20%-30%)

● Young subject

● "Immaturity" of pre-orgasmic sensation control

=== Retrograde ejaculation ===
● Expulsion of the ejaculate towards the bladder

● Bladder neck closure defect

● It does not prevent orgasm.

=== Hypospermia ===
Decreased volume of ejaculate

== ''''' Sexual dyspareunia with pain''''' ==
Dyspareunia is persistent or repeated genital pain associated with sexual intercourse.

In women, a distinction is made between :

* intromission dyspareunia, which corresponds to pain during penetration. This pain may be linked to vulvovaginal dryness, induced vestibulodynia (severe pain caused by pressure during penetration, penile movements or ejaculation), or vaginismus (involuntary spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina).
* Deep dyspareunia: pain during intercourse in the lower abdomen.
