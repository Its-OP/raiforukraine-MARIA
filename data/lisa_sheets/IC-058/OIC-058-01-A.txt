==Normal sexuality?
In terms of sexuality, no standard can be defined (even if "normal" sexuality is part of the WHO definition of good health, it does not exist as such).

Normal sexual behaviour is difficult to define because it is influenced by educational, moral and social constraints that change over time and between cultures. Sexuality is considered "normal" when the sexual response satisfies the person experiencing it, and does not harm partners, friends or society.

The WHO defines sexual health as :

''...a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality, not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health is understood as a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasant and safe sexual experiences, free from coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be assured and protected, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled. "(WHO, 2006a)''

''" Sexuality is understood, first and foremost, as a component of individual freedom and respect for privacy by case law and the law: the law does not regulate sexual behaviour while recognising its free exercise, including for people considered vulnerable" (HAS, 2022).''

==The components of sexuality:==

* Biological sex: biological characteristics that define the male or female character, characteristics that are not mutually exclusive (intersexuality).
* Gender: behaviour, activities and expectations considered appropriate in a given society. Gender is related to, but distinct from, biological sex. A transgender person is someone whose gender identity is not congruent with their biological sex.
* Sexual orientation: attraction to different gender or sexual identities.
* Sexual response: sequence of physiological and emotional events that make sexual intercourse possible (desire, arousal phase, plateau phase, orgasm phase and resolution phase).

==There are many factors influencing the development and course of sexuality:==
*Neuro-biological and psycho-affective factors
*Cultural and social norms
*ethical and legal values
*religious and spiritual beliefs
*economic, political and historical contexts

==The consequences of sexual disorders:==

*Dysfunctions in sexual response can expose the individual and his or her partner to suffering, sometimes severe.
*Sexual behaviour disorders can lead to criminal behaviour.

==The medicalisation of sexual disorders:==

*When there is a dysfunction of the sexual response without complaint from the individual, there is no need to medicalise it.
*When there is a sexual behaviour disorder without complaint from the individual, his entourage or society, there is no need to medicalise it.
*Doctors play a central role in sexual health prevention and education, as well as in the prevention and management of sexual violence.
