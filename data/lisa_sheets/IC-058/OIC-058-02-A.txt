==The 4 phases of sexual response:==
''A sexual relationship begins after a period of sexual desire, consisting of sexual and erotic thoughts or imaginative fantasies. This preliminary phase of desire is not described in all classifications.'' ''Thus, the sexual relationship takes place in four phases, in both men and women:'''

*Excitement
*Plateau
*Orgasm - Ejaculation
*Resolution

==Excitation:==
This is a hydraulic vascular-tissue-sensory mechanism characterised by

- In men, an erection in which the penis moves from a state of flaccidity to a state of tumescence. 3 types of erection have been described:

*''Psychogenic erections:'' activation of brain centres following cortical stimulation (fantasy, visual or auditory stimulation)
*''Nocturnal or waking erections:'' androgen-dependent, occurring involuntarily during REM sleep
*reflex erections:'' following local genital stimulation (or of accessory erogenous zones), via the medullary centres

During the arousal phase, psychogenic and reflex erections come into play.

- In women, vaginal lubrication (vascular transudate due to increased vaginal and vulvar vascularisation), tumescence of the vulva and mucosa of the lower third of the vagina.

==Plateau :==
The stability of the mechanisms of the arousal phase (erection, lubrication) requires continued stimulation (psychological and physical stimuli).

==Orgasm :==



Orgasm is experienced as an intense pleasure. Its quality, intensity and duration vary greatly from one individual to another, and even within the same individual, from one experience to another. In both sexes, this sensation of intense pleasure is accompanied by vasomotor signs and, more often than not, brief contractions of the striated perineal muscles.

In men, orgasm and ejaculation, although normally occurring at the same time, respond to distinct mechanisms. In some cases, they can occur without each other.

Ejaculation is the expulsion of sperm through the urethral meatus, in two distinct phases:

* An emission phase (secretion of seminal fluid, contraction of the seminal tract and closure of the bladder neck).
* An expulsion phase (rhythmic contraction of the periurethral smooth muscles and perineal striated muscles).

==Resolution:==
In men, this corresponds to detumescence of the penis and is classically followed by a refractory period during which a new sexual response cycle cannot be started.

A woman can have several successive orgasms if sexual stimulation is not interrupted, and the resolution phase only occurs after the last orgasm.
