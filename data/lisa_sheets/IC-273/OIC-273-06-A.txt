'''A) Lesional dysphagia'''

1-With stenosis

'''a-''Tumour stenosis:'''''

- Intrinsic to the oesophagus :

squamous cell carcinoma

adenocarcinoma

other rare tumours: sarcomas, neuroendocrine carcinoma ...

- Extrinsic: mediastinal adenopathy, small cell lung cancer, mediastinal tumour, other rare causes

'''b-Non-tumoral stenosis'''

- Peptic stenosis +++ (secondary to gastro-oesophageal reflux)

- Stenosis: caustic, post-radiation, post-endoscopic, post-operative (anastomotic), eosinophilic oesophagitis



2- No stenosis

- Severe oesophagitis (peptic, caustic, post-radiation, drug-induced, infectious (mycotic, viral, etc.))

- Oesophageal diverticula: cervical, known as Zenker's diverticulum (diverticulum on the posterior surface of the oesophagus, at the pharyngo-oesophageal junction); lower third of the oesophagus, known as epiphrenic diverticulum, often associated with oesophageal motor disorders.

'''B) Non-lesional dysphagia''' :

-Primary oesophageal motor disorders: achalasia (see below), hyper-contractile oesophagus, oesophageal spasms.

-Secondary oesophageal motor disorders: scleroderma, dermatomyositis, lupus, myopathy, paraneoplastic ....
