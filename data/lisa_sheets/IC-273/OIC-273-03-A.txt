It is necessary to characterise the background, history and mode of onset of dysphagia:


'''Terrain and antecedents:'''

- Risk factors for ENT or oesophageal cancer: alcohol and/or tobacco consumption (squamous cell carcinoma), overweight/GER (adenocarcinoma).

- Neurological or neuromuscular pathology: after-effects of a stroke, Parkinson's disease, etc.

- Systemic disease (scleroderma), immunodepression (infectious oesophagitis), etc.

- Risk factors for scarring of the oesophagus: history of caustic ingestion / radiotherapy / GERD (peptic stenosis)

-Atopy or asthma (in young people), in association with eosinophilic oesophagitis (50% of patients).

-Current treatments (biphosphonates, cyclins)


'''Mode of onset of dysphagia:'''

-Progressive dysphagia starting with solid foods, leading to a mixed or liquid diet and then to aphagia with salivary stasis, which is suggestive of oesophageal obstruction (particularly neoplastic).

-Paradoxical dysphagia, predominantly with liquids, is classic, although inconstant, in cases of oesophageal motor disorder of the achalasia type.


'''Associated symptoms:''''

- ENT and/or respiratory signs, hiccups, hypersialorrhoea, miscarriage

- altered general condition (anorexia, weight loss), melena


'''All dysphagia is lesional (oesophageal cancer) until proven otherwise'''
