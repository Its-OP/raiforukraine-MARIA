'''Stenosing lesional dysphagia'''

- Tumour causes: cancer of the pharynx, larynx, upper 1/3 of the oesophagus; benign oesophageal tumours (rare)

- Extrinsic causes: large compressive thyroid goitre, thoracic aortic aneurysm, mediastinal tumours.

-- Other upper oesophageal causes: sequelae of caustic ingestion, Plummer-Vinson syndrome


'''Non-lesional dysphagia:'''

- Hypertonia of the crico-pharyngeal muscle

- Neurological or neuromuscular pathologies: myasthenia, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, unilateral vagus nerve palsy, myopathy, pseudobulbar syndrome of vascular origin, etc.


The seriousness of pharyngolaryngeal dysphagia is assessed according to its impact on vital prognosis (false routes, sources of inhalation pneumonia, etc.), and then on quality of life.

Dysphagia caused by cancer, or dysphagia that prevents normal eating, is life-threatening because of the malnutrition it causes.


Acute dysphagia often has obvious causes: (Cf ENT)

     - foreign bodies, ingestion of caustics, tonsillitis and phlegmons

     - apart from these causes, sudden onset of upper dysphagia should prompt a search for a neurological cause
