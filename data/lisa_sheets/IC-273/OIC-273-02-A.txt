Depending on the site of the dysphagia, a distinction is made between :

- Cervico-pharyngeal dysphagia (or upper dysphagia; often of neurological or ENT origin)

- Esophageal dysphagia)

Dysphagia can be differentiated according to its mechanism:

- Lesional dysphagia (linked to an organic oesophageal or extrinsic lesion)

- Functional dysphagia, with no lesion identified (anomalies in the propulsive dynamics of the alimentary bolus)

This classification is used to classify causes rather than to characterise dysphagia in clinical practice.
