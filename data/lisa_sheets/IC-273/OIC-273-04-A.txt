'''This is oesogastroduodenal endoscopy (EOGD''', formerly "FOGD", the F standing for Fibroscopy). This examination :


- Confirms or refutes the lesional nature of dysphagia

- Enables biopsies to be taken of oesophageal lesions

- Should include systematic oesophageal biopsies even in the absence of a visible lesion (eosinophilic oesophagitis)

- Should look for a "popping" sensation when the endoscope is passed over the oesogastric junction, suggestive of oesophageal motor disorder.

- Can diagnose morphological anomalies without mucosal lesions: hiatal hernia, diverticulum, etc.

- May be incomplete in the event of an impassable stenosis or food stasis
