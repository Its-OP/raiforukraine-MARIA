The threshold of 1500 is generally used to determine the "visibility" of an intrauterine pregnancy on pelvic ultrasound.

If the BHCG is greater than 1500 IU / L with uterine vacuity on endovaginal ultrasound, the diagnosis of EP is very likely.

A woman has a pregnancy of undetermined location (GLI) if the pregnancy is neither intra- nor extra-uterine.   

If the pregnancy is of undetermined origin and there are no signs of seriousness, plasma beta-hCG levels and pelvic ultrasound should be repeated vaginally 48 hours later. In a normally progressing intrauterine pregnancy, beta-hCG levels double every 48 hours; in a spontaneous miscarriage, beta-hCG levels decrease. In an extra-uterine pregnancy, the beta-hCG level stagnates or rises insufficiently.
