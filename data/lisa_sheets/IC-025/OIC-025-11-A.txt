- In asymptomatic patients with no formal indication for surgery

- With an EP visible on ultrasound

- Proposed treatment with an injection of methotrexate in the absence of contraindication:

o Patient-related:

§ Difficulties in understanding

§ Monitoring difficulties (poor compliance, geographical distance or isolation)

§ Breastfeeding

§ Refusal: formal choice of surgical treatment

§ History of homolateral EP treated medically or surgically (risk of failure)

o Related to EP:

§ Lateral uterine mass > 4 c m on ultrasound

§ Tubal rupture, significant haemoperitoneum

o Biological :

§ BHCG > 10 000 IU / L

§ Thrombocytopenia < 50,000 / mm<sup>3</sup>.

§ Leukopenia < 2000 / mm<sup>3</sup>.

§ Anemia with Hb < 9 g/dL

§ Severe renal insufficiency with clearance < 30 mL / min

§ Liver failure

§ Coagulation disorders / anticoagulant treatment (IC injection IM)

- Patient must be informed

o Possible side effects of medical treatment (especially renal, hepatic, cutaneous and respiratory)

o Need for urgent reconsultation in the event of severe abdominal pain or malaise

o Risk of failure of around 25% :

§ Possible need for a second injection OR surgical treatment

§ Tubal rupture requiring emergency surgery

o Post-treatment monitoring: mandatory until BHCG levels are negative

§ Tolerance of methotrexate treatment

§ Effectiveness: decrease with BHCG level at D7 strictly lower than D0 or strictly lower than 85% of β-hCG level at D4 if available.

o There is no delay before trying to conceive again (plasma elimination half-life of 3 - 4 hours).
