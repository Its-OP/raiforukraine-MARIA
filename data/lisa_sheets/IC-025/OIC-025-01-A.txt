An ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of an egg outside the uterus. Most commonly ampullary tubal (70%), it can also be isthmic tubal (20%), squamous (5%) or more rarely non-tubal extrauterine.

Beware of heterotopic pregnancies (coexistence of two simultaneous pregnancies: an intrauterine pregnancy and an EP). Main risk factor: medically assisted procreation ''([[Difficulty procreating SD-033|difficulty procreating)]].'''''
