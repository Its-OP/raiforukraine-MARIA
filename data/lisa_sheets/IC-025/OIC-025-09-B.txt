Surgical treatment indicated if :

* Unstable hemodynamics
* Significant abdominal pain
* Plasma beta-hCG > 10,000 IU/l
* Haematosalpinx > 4 cm on ultrasound scan
* Hepatic or renal insufficiency (contraindication to methotrexate treatment)
* Impossibility of outpatient follow-up


Pre-operative conditioning : Peripheral venous lines, analgesia, vascular filling (in case of haemoperitoneum) +/- transfusion of packed red blood cells '''([[Prescribe analgesics SD-250|prescribe analgesics]], [[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]], [[Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion]], [[Pre-anaesthetic consultation SD-300|pre-anaesthetic consultation]], [[Explain a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352|explain a treatment to the patient]])''''


Principles of surgical treatment :

- Laparoscopy under general anaesthetic is the surgical approach of choice

- Laparotomy from the outset in cases of haemodynamic instability

- 1<sup>er</sup> objective: exploration

o Diagnostic confirmation, specifying the location

o Search for contributing factors: adhesions / IGH sequelae

o Assess contralateral tubal status.

- 2<sup>th</sup> objective: treatment

o Conservative treatment: salpingotomy

§ Aspiration of tubal contents after incision of the tube

§ Post-operative monitoring BHCG decrease to negativity

o Non-conservative treatment: salpingectomy

§ In the event of heavy bleeding or excessive tubal damage

§ Coagulation - progressive sectioning of the mesosalpinx

§ No indication for monitoring beta-HCG decay

Systematic anatomopathological analysis of the suction product from the tube or salpingectomy specimen
