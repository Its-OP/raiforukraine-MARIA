Specific risks of :

- Risk of failure of conservative treatment in the case of salpingotomy, which may require reoperation

- Salpingectomy if tubal condition too impaired or if salpingotomy not feasible

o Fertility probably identical if contralateral tube normal

o Need for subsequent in vitro fertilisation if only one tube is removed

- Conversion to laparotomy in the event of uncontrollable bleeding / intraoperative complication

- Intra- or post-operative transfusion

General risks of laparoscopy: organ and vascular wounds, etc.
