The diagnosis can be made clinically, but thoracic imaging is essential (see radiological symptomology).

The clinical elements of a positive clinical diagnosis are :

- Functional signs :

- sudden "stabbing" chest pain, accompanied by breathing and increased by coughing

- dyspnoea, which may be severe

- dry cough


- Physical signs

- Inspection: decrease in mobility and distension of the hemithorax affected by the pneumothorax ("grazing" view)

- Percussion: frank tympany of the hemithorax affected by the pneumothorax.

- Auscultation: decrease in the vesicular murmur of the hemithorax affected by the pneumothorax.

-

- Indirect signs: subcutaneous emphysema.
