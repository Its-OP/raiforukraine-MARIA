These elements are systematically sought on clinical examination.

- Respiratory signs: signs of acute respiratory distress/desaturation.

- Haemodynamic signs in the event of gas tamponade: right heart failure, shock, cardiac arrest.

They do not necessarily correlate with the size of the pneumothorax. A partial pneumothorax may be poorly tolerated from a respiratory point of view in a patient already suffering from respiratory insufficiency.
