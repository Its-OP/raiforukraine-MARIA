Exsufflation is performed in two circumstances:

- pressure pneumothorax with signs of severity

- complete pneumothorax with a detachment of more than 2 cm

In the event of a major emergency (signs of poor respiratory and/or haemodynamic tolerance), in practice :

- Respecting the rules of surgical asepsis

- Puncture using a large-bore catheter

- In the 2<sup>th</sup> intercostal space via an anterior approach on the midclavicular line

- Upper edge of lower side along vertical path

- Success confirmed by "pchit" (evacuation of pressurised air) and immediate clinical improvement

- At the same time, the patient must be given oxygen therapy, volume expansion to combat de-escalation, and often analgesia.


If exsufflation is indicated for large spontaneous complete pneumothorax in young patients, the urgency is often less. In practice, this is the same procedure, often carried out when a drain is placed (see pleural drainage item).
