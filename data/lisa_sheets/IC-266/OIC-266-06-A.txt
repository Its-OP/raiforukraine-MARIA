'''Non-specific management of [[Chronic renal failure in adults and children|chronic renal failure]] and its complications (Cf)''''

'''Therapeutic particularities in PKRAD'''

- Given the early onset of hypertension in adults and children with PKRAD, the aim is to detect it early and achieve a minimum blood pressure of less than 140/90 mmHg (138/85 mmHg by self-measurement). The two most appropriate first-line treatment classes are ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB2).

- Plenty to drink

- Specific treatments to limit the progression of the disease may be discussed following specialist advice.

- Management of complications associated with PKRAD (cystic infection, lithiasis, etc.)

- In the case of [[Organ transplantation: Epidemiological and immunological aspects; principles of treatment and monitoring; complications and prognosis; ethical and legal aspects.
