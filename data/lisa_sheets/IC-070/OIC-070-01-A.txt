Psychiatry of the elderly has been a psychiatry option since 2017 and is based on the definition proposed by the WHO.

"A branch of psychiatry whose general objectives are to detect, treat, assess and prevent all types of psychiatric disorders in the elderly and their consequences.

This concerns :

- psychobehavioural symptoms of dementia (major neurocognitive disorders);

- all psychiatric disorders of the elderly (for which the age threshold has been set at 65), whether psychiatric disorders that began at a younger age and develop with ageing, or late-onset psychiatric disorders.
