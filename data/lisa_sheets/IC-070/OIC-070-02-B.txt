Mood and anxiety disorders

* Characterised depressive episode frequent (1 to 4%) in the over-65s.
* anxiety disorders > 10% in elderly subjects, with generalised anxiety disorder (most common in PA) and phobic disorders in the forefront. Panic disorder is rarer.
* Bipolar disorder about 1% in subjects over 60.

'''Aged and late-onset psychotic disorders'''

The prevalence of schizophrenia is lower than in the young adult population (0.6% vs. 1%) due to the high early mortality rate in these patients.

Alcohol and drug use disorders

* Alcohol: 3rd most common psychiatric disorder among the elderly.
* Difficulties linked to the use of medication: 39 to 55% of people aged over 65 take benzodiazepines and related products in France (see item 77).
