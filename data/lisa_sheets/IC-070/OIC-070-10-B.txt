'''General prescription rules to favour tolerance and avoid iatrogenicity:''''

* Start at half the dose of a young adult;
* increase gradually when necessary (the "start low, go slow" rule);
* Only one psychotropic drug per class,
* avoid combining psychotropic drugs
* assess tolerance and efficacy

'''Antidepressants:'''

give preference to SSRI and SNRI antidepressants, mirtazapine and mianserin because they are well tolerated.

Avoid tricyclics.

'''Thymoregulators''' :

same prescribing rules as for adults, but risk of more serious side effects.

'''Antipsychotics''' :

extrapyramidal tolerance to be monitored. Cardiovascular and cognitive risks.

In neurodegenerative diseases, risk of adverse cerebrovascular effects.
