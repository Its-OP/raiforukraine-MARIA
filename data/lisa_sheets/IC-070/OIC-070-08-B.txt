In the elderly, we need to look for non-psychiatric co-morbidities (pain, cardiovascular pathologies, cancers, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, etc.) as well as psychiatric ones (anxiety disorders, addictions, personality disorders, etc.).

The clinical examination should look for pain, faecal impaction, a bladder globe, infection, etc.

Complementary tests depend on the presenting symptoms: CBC, blood ionogram, blood calcium, blood albumin, TSH, vitamins B9-B12, ECG, kidney and liver function, urine dipstick, protid, blood albumin, blood sugar, chest X-ray, brain imaging, etc.
