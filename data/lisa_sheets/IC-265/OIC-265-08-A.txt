'''Table of clinical aspects of complicated renal colic'''

<Nephritic colic in pregnant women:

-hospitalisation: obstetrical care: premature delivery: 40-70

-pain: NSAIDs: CI in the 3rd<sup>trimester (24 ADT): paracetamol or morphine from the outset

Imaging: ultrasound or non-injected 1.5T MRI: 1st<sup>trimester but difficult in emergency practice or low-dose CT (<4 mSv) 2-3rd trimesters (< 20 mGy).

-1st intention monitoring: expulsion 70-80%.

-renal urine diversion: if pain, PAD, pre-eclampsia, fever, renal failure - catheter or nephrostomy: no recommendation - change every 4-6 weeks
|'''Febrile renal colic = acute obstructive pyelonephritis = severe acute pyelonephritis'''
|Fever >38.5Â°C, chills, skin mottling, haemodynamic instability, positive urine dipstick.
|-
|Renal colic with acute renal failure
|Congenital or acquired single functional kidney

Or bilateral stones (rare)

oligo-anuria < 500cc / 24h
|-
|Hyperalgesic renal colic
|Nephritic colic resistant to NSAID and morphine administration
