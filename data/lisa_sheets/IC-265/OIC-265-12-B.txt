The first-line metabolic work-up recommended by the Lithiasis Committee of the Association Fran√ßaise d'Urologie includes :

* morphological and infrared analysis (Infrared SpectroPhotometry: SPIR) of the stone or fragments to determine the molecular and crystalline composition of the stone,
* a metabolic assessment on :
** fresh morning urine sample: crystalluria, pH, specific gravity, BU
** 24-hour urine analysis: total volume, creatinine, calcium, sodium, urea, urates,
** blood analysis: creatinine, calcium, fasting blood sugar, uricemia.
