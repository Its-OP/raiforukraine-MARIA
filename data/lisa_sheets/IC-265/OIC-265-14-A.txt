(Lithiasis Committee recommendations - AFU 2022: LEC recommendations: R.6: It is suggested that the indications for LEC be limited to kidney stones less than 15 mm in size).


Extracorporeal lithotripsy is contraindicated in cases of :

*congenital or acquired haemostasis and coagulation disorders (anti-aggregant/coagulant treatment),
*pregnancy
*untreated urinary tract infection
*obstruction downstream of the stone,
*aneurysm of the renal artery or aorta,

High stone density (>1000UH) and obesity reduce the effectiveness of LEC.

Complications of LEC include

*the pain of renal colic,
*haematuria, renal or retroperitoneal haematoma,
*urinary tract infections.

Ureteroscopy is contraindicated in cases of :

*untreated urinary tract infection

The complications of ureteroscopy are :

*haematuria
*renal colic pain due to ureteral clotting
*ureteral stricture, ureteral trauma, ureteral avulsion, subcapsular haematoma of the kidney
*urinary tract infection, severe sepsis or even septic shock.
