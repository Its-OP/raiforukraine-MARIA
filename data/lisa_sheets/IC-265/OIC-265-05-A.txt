Renal colic is a [[Acute low back pain|lumbo-abdominal pain syndrome 270]] resulting from sudden tension in the excretory tract of the upper urinary tract upstream of an obstruction, whatever the cause. It is a [[Acute lumbar pain|lumbago 270]] homolateral to the obstruction radiating along the flank towards the external genitalia.
