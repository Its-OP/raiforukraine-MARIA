Lithiasis: disease resulting in the formation of stones in the excretory urinary tract. These stones are composed of crystals and an extra-cellular matrix and occur mainly as a result of renal obstruction or [[Urinary infections in children and adults|pyelonephritis 161]].

The majority of urinary stones form in the kidneys. Bladder stones are rarer and are the result of urine stasis in the bladder, most often due to an obstruction ([[Benign prostatic hyperplasia|BPH]]). [Benign prostatic hyperplasia|127]]).
