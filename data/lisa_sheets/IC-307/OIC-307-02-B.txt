- '''Circumstances of discovery'''

'''They are many:'''

o Bone pain (''Chronic pain, Pain in the lumbar region, Pain in a limb (upper or lower), Pain in the spine (cervical, thoracic or lumbar)'')

o Bone or soft tissue swelling

o Pathological fracture

o Neurological signs: radiculalgia or spinal cord compression (''sensory and/or motor neurological deficit'')

o Hypercalcaemia (''Dyscalcaemia)'''

- Clinical manifestations

o Mechanical pain (benign tumours) or inflammatory pain of increasing intensity (malignant tumours)

o Impaired general condition (malignant tumours) (''Weight loss, Asthenia'')

o Neurological complications, particularly if spinal: ''Lumbar pain''.

ยง Spinal syndrome

ยง Lesion syndrome: pain in the hemicircle, radicular irradiation

ยง Subinjury syndrome: pyramidal syndrome, cauda equina syndrome

- Radiological findings

o Radiographic appearance: osteolysis, osteocondensation, mixed appearance

o A CT scan can be used to analyse the bone structure and cortical bone.

o MRI enables the bone and adjacent tissues to be analysed
