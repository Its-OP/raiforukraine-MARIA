o Findings on questioning that may point to primary cancer :

- Functional signs that may point to primary cancer (cough, haematuria, abdominal pain....)

- Personal and family history, smoking...


o Clinical examination to look for a primary lesion: palpation of the breasts, thyroid gland, liver, lumbar fossa and abdomen, lymph nodes, integument, testicles, pelvic touch, etc.


o Measuring PSA in men


o Radiological appearance :

- Condensing bone metastasis in men: causes prostate cancer to be sought

- Pure lytic metastasis: kidney, lung, thyroid, breast cancer

- Mixed-appearance metastasis: in many cancers, including breast, lung, etc.


o Imaging :

- Chest X-ray

- Mammography in women

- Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic scan and/or 18FDG PET scan to identify the primary lesion


o Bone biopsy: ''Malignant tumours on surgical specimen/biopsy, Interpretation of an anatomopathology report''.

- Confirms the malignant nature of the bone lesion

- Helps to identify the primary tumour/ specify the histological type of the primary tumour, also using immunohistochemical markers

- Enables prognostic factors for therapeutic response to be identified for certain cancers, making targeted treatments possible
