The main work-related cancers and their associated risk factors are as follows (source INRS):

- ''Lung cancer'': the main ones: asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (derived from coal or oil: tar, bitumen), crystalline silica.                                                                                                                        

- Mesothelioma: Asbestos.

- bladder and urinary tract cancer: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons derived from coal or oil, and certain aromatic amines.

- Leukaemia: Ionising radiation, benzene.

- Cancers of the nasal cavity: wood dust, formaldehyde (formaldehyde), chromium compounds.

- Skin cancers: Arsenic and mineral compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, UV radiation.

- Hepatic cancers: arsenic and its mineral compounds, complications of cirrhosis following HBV or HCV.
