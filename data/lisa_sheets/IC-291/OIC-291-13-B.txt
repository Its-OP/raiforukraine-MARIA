A recent INCa study estimates the fraction of risk attributable to occupational exposure at ''around 4% for all incident cancers'', which probably represents between 12,000 and 15,000 new cases per year in France. In order of decreasing proportion of occupational origin, we might mention :

- mesothelioma: 71

- Cancers of the nasal cavity: 25%.

- Lung cancer: 15%.

- Leukaemia: 5 to 18%.

- Bladder and urinary tract cancers: 2%.
