The violence experienced by the patient can also be caused by the illness or the care provided.

- regarding the illness: it may be experienced in a violent way because of its seriousness, its uncertain prognosis or because of a particular experience linked to the patient's personal history;

- regarding treatment": treatment in itself constitutes an attack on physical integrity. Apart from a few exceptions, it is only carried out if there is a medical justification and if the patient consents ([[Know the definition and conditions for obtaining informed consent 2C-007-PC-A01|link 2C-007-PC-A01]]). In addition, the violence experienced may be related to the invasive, painful or unexpected nature of a procedure, examination or consultation.

To prevent and combat the violence inherent in medical care, healthcare professionals must :

- take the time to explain the examination / procedure to the patient;

- explain why it was necessary;

- ensure that the patient understands the procedure;

- listen to fears and apprehensions ;

- Re-explain and reassure the patient if possible;

- [[Know the definition and conditions for obtaining informed consent 2C-007-PC-A01|link 2C-007-PC-A01]] obtain oral and possibly written consent for certain procedures.
