Violence in healthcare settings is linked to three factors:

- HUMAN FACTORS ;

- institutional factors (organisation, training, care coordination, etc.) ;

- architectural factors (design of premises, etc.)

Violence against individuals was mainly perpetrated by patients (70%) or accompanying visitors (18%). Staff were involved in 3% of cases. When violence is perpetrated by patients, it is often linked to human factors (psychological or neuropsychological disorders in the perpetrator)<ref>https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/rapport_onvs_2020_donnees_2019_vd_2021-03-11.pdf</ref>.

Situations of violence can be divided into 4 categories: delinquent behaviour, incivilities, violence by people suffering from a psychiatric disorder and violence between or by healthcare staff.

The 4 main "reasons for violence" reported were "reproach relating to care" (45.3%), "refusal of care" (20.2%), "waiting time deemed excessive" (11%) and "alcohol abuse" (9.7%).

The main lines of conduct are :

- in the event of a conflict experienced by a carer: do not remain alone (warn them) and take cover in the event of danger and try to understand the patient's problem by remaining calm and reformulating it with them;

- in the event of aggression experienced by a carer (in the aftermath): declaration as an accident at work, declaration of undesirable event and possibility of filing a complaint.
