|Oral cavity/ oropharynx/

Maxillary sinus
|Cervico-thoracic CT scan (extension of the mass to soft tissue and bone, search for a synchronous tumour, lymph node and lung metastases).

MRI of the oral cavity and mandible (medullary extension if bone involvement, tongue extension, better if dental artefact on the scan)

MRI of the oropharynx (veil extension, masticatory muscles, tongue)

PET-CT if ≥N2b, adenopathy in sectors IV and V, search for secondary sites, second primary, unknown primary in the case of adenopathy without an entry site, particularly in the oropharynx.
|-
|Larynx/ Hypopharynx
|Cervico-thoracic CT scan (extension of the mass to soft tissue and cartilage, search for a synchronous tumour, lymph node and lung metastases).

PET-CT if ≥N2b, adenopathy in sectors IV and V, search for secondary sites, second primary site
|-
|Nasopharynx
|Skull base and cervical CT or MRI (extension of mass: soft tissue, bone, orbital cavity, [[Anatomy:Cavernous sinus|cavernous sinus]], lymph node metastases)

Systematic PET-CT to look for secondary sites, particularly lymph nodes Sensitivity ++.
|-
|ethmoidal sinus
|Cervico-thoracic CT (extension of the mass to soft tissue and bone, lymph node metastases more rarely, lung exceptional)

MRI (orbital cavity extension, [[Anatomy:Cavernous sinus|cavernous sinus]], brain)
|-
|If reconstruction by bone flap
|Arteriography of the lower limbs
