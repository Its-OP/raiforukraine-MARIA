| colspan="4" |CALLING SIGNS AND MAIN CLINICAL SIGNS BY TOPOGRAPHY
|-
|Oral cavity
| colspan="3" |Persistent heterogeneous (red and white) leukoplakic lesion

Ulceration / swelling

Pain

Dental mobility

Lingual protraction disorders (T4)

Trismus (T4)

Bilateral submental or subangulomaxillary adenopathy

Induration on palpation and bleeding on contact
|-
|Oropharynx
| colspan="3" |Ulceration/tumefaction
Induration on palpation and bleeding on contact

Lingual mobility disorder (base of tongue)



Sub-angulo-maxillary lymphadenopathy ++ +- bilateral

Isolated adenopathy, the first frequent warning sign
|-
|Hypopharynx
| colspan="3" |Dysphagia/odynophagia/otalgia reflex ++

Dysphonia or even dyspnoea if the larynx is invaded

Jugulocarotid lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral ++.

|Subglottic
|-
|dysphagia ++

Dysphonia (blockage of a vocal cord or glottic invasion)

Dyspnoea (tumour mass ++)

Odynophagia and reflex otalgia

Jugulo-carotid adenopathy
<br />
|dysphonia ++

Dysphagia if invasion of the supraglottic stage

No adenopathy unless extraglottic extension

Dyspnoea (tumour mass ++)
|Rare early tumour form

Dyspnoea and jugulocarotid adenopathy (tumour mass ++)
|-
|Nasopharynx
| colspan="3" | Tubal dysfunction ++ (serous otitis)

Nasal obstruction

Epistaxis

Isolated or bilateral cervical adenopathy

Invasion of the base of the skull in late forms (paralysis of III, IV, V, VI, thrombosis of the [[Anatomy:Cavernous sinus|cavernous sinus]]) <br />.
|-
|Ethmoid sinus
| colspan="3" |Unilateral nasal obstruction ++

Epistaxis ++

Mucopurulent rhinorrhea

Hyposmia

Tumour mass ++ (ophthalmological and neurological signs)
|-
|Maxillary sinus
| colspan="3" |Dental pain, tooth mobility ++ (ophthalmic and neurological signs)

Facial pain (suborbital nerve, V2 branch)

Acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis.

Tumours of the maxillary arch can also invade the maxillary sinus, the picture is initially oral and the risk factors those of cancers of the oral cavity.

NB: LMNH presents in the tonsils, more often than in the base of the tongue, as a unilateral enlargement with pharyngeal discomfort and sometimes a muffled voice. In the cavum, as with UCNT, unilateral serous otitis is a suggestive sign. Cervical adenopathy is common. <br />
