In 2017, VADS cancers (excluding lymphoma) ranked 4<sup>th</sup> in men in terms of the number of new cases (10932) and 8<sup>th</sup> in terms of the number of deaths, and 10 th in women in terms of the number of new cases (4332) and 8<sup>th</sup> in terms of the number of deaths.

Overall survival at 5 years was 34% in men and 49% in women in 2017, but depends very much on the stage of the disease, risk factors (better prognosis for HPV-induced cancers) and location (better prognosis for the larynx).
