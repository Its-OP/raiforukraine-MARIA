'''1/ As part of screening for asymptomatic subjects'''

o Mass screening for subjects with no risk factors (average risk) using the Fecal Immunologic Test (FIT) every 2 years from the age of 50 until the age of 75.

o Colonoscopy in subjects at risk (high risk in the case of a personal or family history of colorectal cancer or adenoma, long-standing IBD, hereditary predisposition to Lynch or familial polyposis, acromegaly).



'''2/ Exploring symptoms:''''

- Recent changes in transit (a few months)

- Colon: few symptoms for several months

o Emergency :

§ Colonic occlusion most often in the left colon

§ More rarely perforation, peritonitis, fistula

o Abdominal pain (site: colonic setting)

§ Gradual onset (several weeks)

§ May suggest sigmoiditis

o Haemorrhage is usually small and recurrent

§ Macroscopic: rectal discharge (left), melena (right colon)

§ Occult iron deficiency anaemia +++++

o Rarely :

§ Abdominal mass, hepatomegaly (metastases)

§ altered general condition

§ Infection with a digestive portal of entry (endocarditis, sigmoiditis, liver abscess)

- Rectum: in addition to the circumstances mentioned for the colon

o Rectal syndrome (false needs = épreintes, sensation of tension in the rectum = tenesmus)

o Rectorrhagia (very often wrongly attributed to haemorrhoids) +++

o False constipation diarrhoea due to tumour obstruction (intermittent diarrhoea with periods of constipation, mucus)
