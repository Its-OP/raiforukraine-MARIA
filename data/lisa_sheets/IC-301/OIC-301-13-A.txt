Except in the case of emergency surgery or when the patient is extremely frail, colonoscopy under general anaesthetic should be performed systematically to provide a definitive anatomopathological diagnosis (biopsies) and to look for synchronous lesions (adenomas or synchronous 2nd<sup> cancer).


Biological work-up required before anaesthesia (blood count, platelets, PT, aPTT, creatininaemia) and to assess general condition (albuminemia).

Measurement of the Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA) marker is not a diagnostic test, but may be useful for patient follow-up.


- For cancers of the colon (recto-sigmoid hinge to cecum): ''Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic scan with injection''.

- For cancers of the rectum (accessible to RT): ''Pelvic MRI and thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with injection''
