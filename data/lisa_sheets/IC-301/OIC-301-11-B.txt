'''Familial adenomatous polyposis''' (FAP) autosomal dominant transmission, (APC gene mutation), rare disease (<1% of colorectal cancer cases). Innumerable adenomas appear throughout the colon and rectum from the age of 10, with a risk of cancer from adolescence onwards and a cumulative risk of more than 70%, requiring preventive total colectomy from the end of adolescence. Surveillance by annual colonoscopy discussed from the age of 10. The diagnosis is usually known within the family.
