The indication for '''constitutional genetic''' testing after a positive diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum depends on the results of the pathological examination (cf '''2C-301-EC-B01)''''

o If there is a loss of expression of one of the 4 proteins of the MMR (''MismatchRepair'') system or MSI (''MicroSatellite Instability'') status in the tumour, there is a suspicion of Lynch syndrome.

o If no MSI status :

ยง If polyposis (on endoscopy or surgical specimen)

ยง In the absence of polyposis, depending on age and history :

- Systematic before the age of 40

- After the age of 40, in the presence of a first-degree family history of colorectal, non-colorectal digestive, corpus uteri or excreto-urinary adenocarcinoma, with at least 2 generations affected, 3 family cases, one of which before the age of 50 (Amsterdam II criteria).


Somatic genetic testing (modification of tumour tissue only) is systematically indicated on tumour samples in metastatic situations, as the result influences the therapeutic indications (MSI, RAS and BRaf).
