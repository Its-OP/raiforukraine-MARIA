An adenoma is a benign tumour lesion that can progress to degeneration. Its prevalence increases with age, reaching 30-50% after the age of 50. A minority (5%) of adenomas will develop into adenocarcinomas.

In the case of adenomas which develop into adenocarcinomas, the histological abnormalities follow the sequence of low-grade dysplasia, then high-grade dysplasia, then adenocarcinoma. The average duration of the healthy mucosa-adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence is around 10 years.

o The risk of degeneration into adenocarcinoma is linked to certain factors:

§ The size of the adenoma: for an adenoma larger than 1 cm, the risk is 8% at 10 years and 25% at 20 years. In adenomas smaller than 1 cm, the risk of finding a focus of adenocarcinoma is estimated at 0.3%.

§ The number of adenomas: the risk is significantly higher if the number is greater than 5.

§ The histological type with, in ascending order of risk: tubular (lowest risk) then tubulovascular (intermediate risk) then vascular (highest risk).

§ The degree of dysplasia with increasing risk: low grade; high grade

§ The form with a particular risk for flat and/or scalloped adenomas.
