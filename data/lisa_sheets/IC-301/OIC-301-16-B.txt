'''The principles:''' ablation of localised disease, the decision to which must be validated at a '''RÃ©union de Concertation Pluridisciplinaire (RCP)'''.


The first line of treatment is surgical resection.

Endoscopic resection'' for very superficial lesions is sometimes possible (Tis, T1sm1).

''For subperitoneal rectal cancer, preoperative chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy is indicated in cases of locally advanced tumour (T3-T4 and/or N+)''. This treatment reduces the risk of local recurrence. This radio-chemotherapy is decided on the basis of MRI data.

Surgical resection requires removal of the primary tumour with margins of at least 5 cm, together with removal of the vessels and the mesocolon containing the lymphatic network and its lymph nodes.

For cancers of the colon and rectum, postoperative chemotherapy is recommended if there is lymph node involvement.
