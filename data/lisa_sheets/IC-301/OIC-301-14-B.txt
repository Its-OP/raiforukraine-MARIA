Second-line treatment for colon and rectal cancer:

- MRI of the liver is sometimes necessary if there is any doubt about metastases or if resection of liver metastases is envisaged (as it is more sensitive than CT);

- Other imaging examinations are only requested when clinically indicated (bone, brain).

Second-line treatment of the rectum:

- Endoscopic ultrasound in cases of small lesions (mobile on the finger) and contraindication to MRI.
