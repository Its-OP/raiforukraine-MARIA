Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in France after breast and prostate cancer. It is the most common digestive cancer in France, with 51,000 new cases and 21,000 deaths by 2022.

Like other industrialised countries, France is one of the high-risk regions for colorectal cancer. Around 5% of the population will develop colon or rectal cancer.  The incidence of colorectal cancer is falling slightly in France. The fall in incidence is attributed to the effectiveness of screening, despite the fact that only 30% of people are actually screened. A participation rate of 50% would reduce mortality by 20%.

In over 85% of cases it is diagnosed after the age of 50. The average age of diagnosis is 70. The sex ratio is 1. Rectal location in 35% of cases.
