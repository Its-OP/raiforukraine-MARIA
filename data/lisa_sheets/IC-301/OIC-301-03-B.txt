This includes a macroscopic description of the specimen, followed by a microscopic description.

The primary tumour is described by its "anatomopathological type", most often a lieberk√ºhnian adenocarcinoma, and its "degree of differentiation" as well-differentiated, moderately-differentiated or poorly-differentiated. The prognosis is poorer with loss of differentiation.

The infiltration of the tumour process into the wall is also prognostic: mucosa: Tis, submucosa: T1, muscularis: T2, subserosa or serosa without crossing it: T3, crossing the serosa: T4.

'''Invasion of lymph nodes''' ''(N 0/+)''' on a number of lymph nodes examined equal to at least 12 is also a prognostic factor, as is, to a lesser degree, the existence of venous and lymphatic tumour emboli and peri-nervous sheathing.



There is a regularly updated international classification, the main principles of which can be summarised as follows
{| class="wikitable"
|Stage I
|T1-2, N0, M0 (small tumour without lymph node invasion)
|-
|Stage II
|T3-4, N0, M0 (large tumour without lymph node involvement)
|-
|Stage III
|All T, N+, M0 (node positive)
|-
|Stage IV
|All T, all T, M+ (distant metastasis)
