Colonoscopic surveillance after endoscopic resection of adenomas depends :

- The number of adenomas

- Their size

- Their nature (urban, scalloped)

- The presence and grade of dysplasia

- The quality of colon preparation at the time of the examination (visibility)

- The clinical context


It can vary from 3 months to 5 years depending on the combination of parameters.

In the most common case: If the colonoscopy was of good quality and there are fewer than 3 adenomas, less than 1 cm in size and no dysplasia, surveillance is scheduled every 5 years.
