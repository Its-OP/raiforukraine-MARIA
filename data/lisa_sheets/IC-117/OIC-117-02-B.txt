Genetic predisposition (multiple susceptibility genes), therefore possible familial predisposition.

Involvement of the immune system (TH1 and TH17 pathways) with increased production of inflammatory cytokines leading to increased proliferation and disorders in keratinocyte differentiation, neo-angiogenesis and neutrophil recruitment.

Multiple triggering or aggravating factors: skin trauma (Koebner's phenomenon), medication (beta-blockers, lithium, sartans, ACE inhibitors), infectious episodes linked to specific pathogens (streptococci, HIV), emotional stress, etc.

This leads to accelerated epidermal renewal and inflammatory skin lesions.
