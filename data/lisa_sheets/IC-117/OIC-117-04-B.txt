</gallery>'''Erythrodermic form''': often from plaque psoriasis. Generalised erythema, diffuse oedematous infiltration of the skin giving a draped, wrinkled appearance to the skin (Figure 9), inconstant or abundant scales, altered general condition, fever and chills possible.

Generalised pustular form'': sudden onset of diffuse pustules on highly inflammatory psoriasis lesions (Figure 10), altered general condition, hyperthermia and chills, biological inflammatory syndrome, neutrophil hyperleukocytosis, hepatic cytolysis. Progression through flare-ups with return to normal skin or to a more typical form of plaque psoriasis.

For both forms: possible life-threatening condition, patients need to be admitted to hospital. May occur after systemic corticosteroid therapy.

Psoriatic arthritis: affects 20-30% of plaque psoriasis. Can occur at any time during the course of cutaneous psoriasis. Functional prognosis. This diagnosis may determine the choice of treatment.
