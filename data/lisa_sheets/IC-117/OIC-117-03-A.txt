<nowiki></gallery></nowiki>The diagnosis is clinical in the presence of erythematosquamous, well-limited, sometimes thick/infiltrated lesions developed mainly on areas where there is recurrent rubbing (elbows, knees, sacrum), rounded, oval in shape, variable in size ( Figures 1 A, B and C: plaque psoriasis)

'''Biopsy unnecessary in the presence of a typical picture''

Possible damage:

-Nails (deformations, punctures) (Figures 2 A , B , C and D )

-Folds or inverted psoriasis: large folds (Figure 3), small folds (umbilicus) (Figure 4), genitals (Figure 5) with lesions that are often not very scaly

-On the scalp, in the form of thick scales (helmets leading to possible hair loss) and inflammatory lesions on the forehead (Figure 6).

-Extremities (palmoplantar psoriasis) (Figure 7) with hyperkeratotic lesions, with painful cracks and fissures that impair function

-Face: rare but very similar to seborrhoeic dermatitis (Figure 8)

Chronic course, with occasional flare-ups triggered by episodes of infection, personal life, etc.

Regression of lesions, sometimes at the cost of more or less long-lasting pigmented sequelae, but no scars.

Pruritus common in the most inflammatory forms
