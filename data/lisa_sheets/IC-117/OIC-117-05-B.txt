</gallery>Pityriasis rosé de Gibert: viral eruptive dermatosis of a seasonal nature in young subjects. Eruption of annular erythematosquamous lesions of the trunk, preceded by an initial inset lesion (Figure 11). No chronicity.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis: Scaly erythematous lesions in the median areas of the face, nasolabial folds and forehead, associated pruritus and oily scalp scales. Progression in flare-ups influenced by stress or fatigue (Figure 12).

Chronic eczema: predisposing atopic background. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between forms such as nummular eczema (Figure 13) and palmo-plantar involvement.

Dermatophytes of hairless skin (Figure 14): Severe pruritus, evolution of lesions on dermocorticoids.

Cutaneous lymphomas (Figure 15): Biopsy at the slightest doubt.
