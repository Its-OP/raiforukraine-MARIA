</gallery>Napkin psoriasis: in infants. Erythematosquamous lesions of the seat (under the nappy). (Figure 16).

Guttate psoriasis: in young people. Often eruptive, with a return to normal skin between flare-ups. Small, diffuse elements (drops) with less marked scaling than in the plaque form (Figure 17). Outbreaks often preceded by an infectious episode of the upper airways (strep throat).
