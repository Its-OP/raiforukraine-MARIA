The diagnosis to be made in the presence of a ''red, painless eye with no loss of visual acuity'' is subconjunctival haemorrhage.

The diagnoses to be considered in the presence of a ''red, painful eye with no loss of visual acuity'' are as follows:

- conjunctivitis

- episcleritis

- scleritis

Signs of orientation:

- purulent conjunctival secretions, eyelids stuck together on waking in the morning = bacterial conjunctivitis ;

- few secretions, suggestive context = viral or allergic conjunctivitis ;

- isolated puddle = subconjunctival haemorrhage.
