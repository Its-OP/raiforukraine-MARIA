'''Episcleritis:'''

It is an inflammation localised to the episclera (located under the conjunctiva), with redness most often in sectors or more rarely diffuse, which disappears after instillation of a vasoconstrictor eye drop (phenylephrine hydrochloride or Neosynephrine®). Ocular pain is moderate.  Examination of the anterior segment is normal, but the lesion sometimes takes on a nodular relief appearance.  A systemic disease should be investigated from the outset, as is the case with scleritis, if the questioning is informative or in the event of a recurrence.  Isolated episcleritis is treated locally with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids.


'''Sclerite:''''

This is a localised inflammation of the sclera, causing severe eye pain. These pains often cause sleeplessness, waking the patient at the end of the night. In this case, a flat or nodular redness is observed, either localised in a sector or diffuse, which does not disappear when vasoconstrictive eye drops are instilled. The presence of scleral necrosis or ulcerating peripheral keratitis are markers of severity.

In the case of scleritis, we need to look for an underlying systemic disease or infectious process:

*joint signs: ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus;
*vascular signs: periarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's disease), cryoglobulinemia, more rarely Behçet's disease;
*Digestive signs: chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD);
*Cutaneous signs: psoriasis, lupus;
*bronchopulmonary signs: tuberculosis, atrophic polychondritis, more rarely sarcoidosis;
*infectious context: herpes or shingles, borreliosis, local pyocyanic infection.


In idiopathic cases or those of rheumatological origin, the first-line treatment consists of general non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In severe cases, or those associated with a progression of the general disease, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or biotherapies are preferred.

Finally, when an infectious cause is found, a suitable anti-microbial treatment is systematically prescribed.
