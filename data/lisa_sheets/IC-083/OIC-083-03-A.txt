Subconjunctival haemorrhage is common, usually unilateral, painless or only causes a sensation of local tension when it is significant (e.g. patients on anticoagulants). It takes the form of a haematic spot, the colour of which varies according to the thickness of the deposit.

It regresses in a few weeks without treatment, but should prompt a search for a local vascular anomaly or unrecognised arterial hypertension.

In a traumatic context, a wound of the conjunctiva and the eyeball must be systematically looked for.

If there is the slightest doubt, an orbital scan should be ordered to look for a CEIO that has gone unnoticed. MRI is contraindicated until the possibility of a metallic foreign body has been formally ruled out.
