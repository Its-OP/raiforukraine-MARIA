<u>The management of dry eye is based on:</u>

*Instilling tear substitutes (ideally without preservatives): eye drops, sometimes called artificial tears (available in bottles or single-dose packs) or gels (available in tubes or single-dose packs);
*avoidance of irritating or aggravating factors: chemical vapours, tobacco, dust, sunlight (tinted glasses), air conditioning, dry air or forced hot air (humidifiers). Then, depending on the case, on :

*temporary or permanent occlusion of the lacrimal points;
*general treatments (parasympatholytic secretagogues, fluidifiers);
*local corticosteroid treatments in short courses or topical ciclosporin as a prolonged treatment in certain selected cases;
*the possible use of wet glasses or scleral lenses if the condition is severe.
