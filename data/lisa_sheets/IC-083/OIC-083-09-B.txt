'''The indications for a conjunctival swab for microbiological analysis are:'''

- acute bacterial conjunctivitis if failure of first-line probabilistic treatment


'''The indications for corneal sampling for microbiological analysis are:'''

- clinical suspicion of bacterial, mycotic or parasitic keratitis

- herpetic keratitis: atypical forms or in cases of proven therapeutic resistance


A sample is always taken by sterile swabbing, if possible before any topical anti-infective treatment, and transferred to the microbiology laboratory in a suitable transport medium:

- direct examination + culture + antibiotic susceptibility test or antifungal susceptibility test (bacteriology, mycology)

- or for molecular diagnosis by PCR depending on the diagnostic orientation (virology, bacteriology)
