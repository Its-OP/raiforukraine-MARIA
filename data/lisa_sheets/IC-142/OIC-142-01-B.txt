====<u>''1-Definition/Population concerned''</u>====
All children with a ''serious life-threatening illness'', whether life-limiting (no hope of cure, usual early death) or life-threatening (curative treatment possible but high risk of premature death).


Six groups were identified according to life-threatening or life-limiting pathology, including :

*<Group 5: Newborns with very limited life expectancy.

Palliative care does not stop when the child dies. It includes support for the family's "bereavement":

*<Group 6: Members of a family who have lost a child unexpectedly as a result of illness, a situation caused by an external cause or a loss during the perinatal period. E.g.: trauma, stillbirths, abortions.

===='''<u>2-Integrated, non-sequential approach</u>.'''====
''Early palliative care'' may be concomitant with any curative care. In all cases, it involves active management.               '''It is the intensity and objective of the treatments that are discussed.'''

===='''<u>3-Graduated organisation</u>'''''.====
For complex situations, frontline teams, can call on, '''regional paediatric palliative care resource teams''' (ERRSPP) or paediatric EMSP mobile palliative care teams; including at home.

===='''<u>4-A triangulation child - parents - carers</u>'''====
Integrate the coexistence of '''parental competence and vulnerability.'''

====<u>'''5-Three perinatal situations:'''</u>====
<u>Antenatal</u>

*Extreme prematurity at the limits of viability :

high risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly neurological.

'''<22SA and/or <500g'' : foetus (antenatal) / newborn (after birth) said to be '''non-viable'''.

<24SA: Most French teams do not resuscitate

between 24 and 26 weeks' gestation: on a case-by-case basis

The parents' wishes, informed of the severity of the prognosis, are an important factor in the decision.

*incurable and particularly serious genetic diseases and malformations.

After antenatal diagnosis, if the parents wish to continue the pregnancy and do not request a medical termination of pregnancy (IMG). Uncertainty is often at its greatest. There is the possibility of foetal death in utero, death at birth, or a life of unpredictable duration, very short or prolonged over months or years with a severe disability. Thinking about all these possibilities at the same time: psychological violence for the parents.

Information for parents, diagnostic reassessment at birth.

When in doubt, intensive management of organ failure will be initiated. In some cases, resuscitation on standby and urgent collegial consultation are necessary.


<u>Post-natal</u>

*Neonatal resuscitation situations with therapeutic impasse or diagnosis of particularly serious neurological lesions (extreme prematurity or severe perinatal anoxia). '''The question arises of a decision to ''limit or stop'' treatment''''' '''by collegial procedure''' in accordance with the ''Clayes-Leonetti law''. [Unreasonable obstinacy and limitation. Cadre législatif, fondements philosophiques et éthiques* 2C-009-PC-A06]] ; [[Procédure Collégiale 2C-009-PC-B05]]

===='''<u>6-Palliative care in the delivery room:</u>'''====
However short it may be, it is '''a time for living''' and not a time for waiting for death. Draw on the concepts developed by "developmental care". Parents will be involved according to their wishes.

'''''Hetero-evaluation''''' via the '''NFCS Neonatal Face Coding System, EDIN''' scales (Newborn Pain and Discomfort Scale). [Assessment of pain in children 2C-137-DP-A02

''''' Analgesic and/or sedative treatments''''' in the event of symptoms: sucrose (sugar solution), morphine, midazolam (usually oral).

===='''<u>7-In the event of death:</u>'''====
-Respect and propose '''rituals and memorial traces.'''

-In the event of the death of a viable newborn (>22SA; weight >500g) who is still alive, there is a "specific neonatal death certificate" (D0-J28).

In the event of a non-viable birth or death in utero after 14 weeks' gestation, the foetus has no legal status, but "registration in the family record book and a funeral" are possible if the parents so wish.
