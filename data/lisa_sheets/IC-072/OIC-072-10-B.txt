'''The explanation of the cerebral origin:'''

imbalance between cognitive anticipation and bodily perceptions.

'''Objectives:'''

- reduce cognitive anticipation

- restoring the place of bodily perceptions

'''Example of a hot bath to explain Bayesian theory''': immersing the body in very hot water is often unpleasant, even painful. After a few seconds, the painful sensation disappears even though the temperature of the water has not changed. During immersion, the brain anticipates a potential burn. This gamble was corrected by peripheral nerve signals. When there are no lesions, the unpleasantness and pain disappear.

Physical rehabilitation for fibromyalgia

combats avoidance due to painful cognitive anticipation and physical deconditioning (a factor in maintaining and aggravating pain).
