'''First stage of care: recognising and legitimising symptoms:'''

Without this step, patients have to fight for recognition and claim disability, which makes it difficult to recover if they have to prove that they are ill.

'''Taking into account the complexity described in the biomedical-psychosocial model:'''

By integrating the patient's agenda (beliefs, representations, expectations, emotions) with the doctor's agenda (medical history, clinical examination).

- avoids an unsatisfactory or even iatrogenic doctor-patient relationship

- brings together "the doctor's disease" (objectifiable biological reality) and "the patient's illness" (subjective reality resulting from lived experience)

'''Gathering the patient's story as part of a patient-centred approach:'''

By carrying out an open interview including the collection of :

- ALL symptoms, as opposed to an interrogation with closed questions that only find symptoms belonging to a biomedical entity

- their secular interpretation

- associated emotions

- the socially constructed experience of SSF (interaction with those around us)

- the contributing factors at the pace of the patient, who confides in us as the interviews progress.

This narrative (narrative medicine) gives meaning: a therapeutic action.

The words chosen reflect the patient's experience and make sense to both patient and doctor.

The personalised metaphor (provided by the patient) provides a plausible explanation (example: anxiety creates muscular tension...).

'''Taking into account the need for social legitimisation: ''socialised illness'' :''''

Illness: unsanctioned deviant social behaviour that elicits care and compassion, provided that it is attributed to an agent beyond the individual's control. It is easier to have chronic Lyme disease than chronic fatigue syndrome: legitimacy is acquired through exogenous attribution.

'''Using reinsurance:''''

By giving patients the assurance of "the care provider's expertise and commitment to being attentive and available".

'''Take into account the concept of quaternary prevention:'''

To avoid :

- patient anxiety and the high cost to the healthcare system of multiple examinations and additional opinions

- probable incidentalomas

'''Accounting for complexity using circular causality:''''

- interactions of predisposing, precipitating and chronicising factors

- move away from simplifying linear causality: "it's in your head, it's a hidden depression".

'''Pitfalls to avoid:'''

- separating soma and psyche in a Cartesian dualism

- consider an SSF as "less real", always "psychogenic" or even "imaginary".

- unconsciously (or consciously) perceiving patients as being responsible for their symptoms and SSF (even guilty)

- blaming guilty patients for the lack of a cure

- focus on "disease

- encouraging diagnostic and therapeutic wandering by multiplying the number of complementary opinions and tests = encourages the assumption of the patient's identity and has no lasting reassuring effect.

- classify these patients as "difficult" or "heartsink patients" because of the difficulties in managing them.
