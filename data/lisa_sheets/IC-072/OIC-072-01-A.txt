Somatic symptom disorders'' (SSD) (DSM-5) can be defined as the chronicisation of medically unexplained physical symptoms with an impact on quality of life.

Somaticians refer to SSDs as "functional somatic syndromes" (FSS), for example irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia.

The term ''bodily distress disorder'' (ICD-11) recognises the suffering of patients, but the word distress has a ''psychic'' connotation.
