'''Contributing factors:''''

- traumatic childhood events

- life events

'''Predisposing factors:'''

- a history of "organic" disease

- test and imaging results indicating disease at a sub-clinical stage

- culture and/or education: consultations, whether or not to treat complaints from childhood

- the healthcare system and access to care

- epigenetics: the study of the nature of mechanisms that reversibly modify gene expression without changing the DNA sequence

'''Aetiological factors:'''

- neurobiological theories: excess nociception resulting from central sensitisation

- the theory of the "Bayesian" central nervous system: which constructs its environment using bets, including the state of the body, and makes bad bets in the context of SSFs

'''Precipitating factors''' :

- accidents of life

- acute illnesses

- traumatic events.

'''Maintenance factors:'''

- lack of personal and professional support

- deconditioning or even avoidance of exertion or everyday activities

'''Chronicisation factors:''''

- a high level of concern for their health

- co-morbid anxiety and depression

- the belief that you are ill

- a loss of confidence in health professionals, with an increase in the number of examinations, opinions and even recourse to so-called alternative and complementary medicines

- primary benefits: resolving or alleviating an intrapsychic conflict with recognition of the patient's status in order to restore a social identity

- secondary benefits: obtaining material rewards (e.g. time off work)

- interactions between predisposing factors, precipitating factors, aetiological factors and chronicisation factors ("example": antecedent illness in childhood + life event + bad bet + excess nociception = deconditioning for effort: chronicisation).

'''Aggravating factors:'''

- e.g. deconditioning or even avoidance of exertion or everyday activities
