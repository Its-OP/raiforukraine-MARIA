SST is neither a psychological reaction to physical symptoms nor a hidden depression.

The terms used are: absence of organic cause = psychiatric origin.

Psychiatric origin :

- For patients: rarely acceptable

- For doctors: risk of simplification and separation of the soma-psyche.

Organic substrate possible, at least in part: symptoms no longer necessarily unexplained.
