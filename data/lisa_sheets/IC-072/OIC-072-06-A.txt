No organic bedrock: most often

If organic substrate: it does not explain the extent of the phenomenon and the usual treatments are less effective.

'''Psycho-behavioural diagnostic criteria:'''

Often found by doctors and sometimes recognised by patients:

- a high level of health anxiety

- a strong, even exaggerated focus on the body

'''Comorbidities:'''

As many anxiety and depression co-morbidities as for so-called organic pathologies: e.g. the same levels of anxiety and depression in patients with fibromyalgia as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

'''Developments:'''

- Disappearance

- Regression

- Persistence

'''Different levels of severity:''''

- self-limiting symptoms

- TSS (DSM-5) more than six months old

- long-term disabilities

'''Factors predictive of severity and complex pathways:''''

- multiple symptoms

- high level of health anxiety

- poor quality of personal and professional life

'''Overlaps:'''

- Between SSFs: frequent (e.g. fibromyalgia and IBS) with a debate as to the uniqueness or diversity of these nosological entities.

- With certain pathologies such as chronic cervical or lumbar spine pain.
