SynACTHene ® (tetracosactide) is an ACTH analogue.

It directly explores primary adrenal insufficiency and indirectly the possibility of corticotropic insufficiency by testing for adrenal atrophy resulting from the lack of stimulation of the adrenal cortex by ACTH.

The synactene test consists of :

*cortisol measurement before the test (at 8 hours)
*IM or IV administration of a 250 µg ampoule of tetracosactide
*followed by a cortisol measurement at 1 hour (+/- 30 min).
*Interpretation:
** peak cortisol < 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) = no response to synacthenes test = adrenal insufficiency, ''whatever the aetiology.''
** cortisolemia is ≥ 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) = response is normal = adrenal insufficiency ruled out EXCEPT in cases of recent or partial adrenocortical insufficiency. This is because the adrenal cortex is not atrophied and will be able to respond to a high dose of exogenous ACTH during the test. (example: acquired corticotropic insufficiency following surgery for a pituitary adenoma, when the corticotropic axis was normal pre-operatively).
**Two other stimulation tests can be carried out but in a hospital setting: insulin hypoglycaemia or the Metopirone test.

If the pre-test cortisol is <5 ng/ml (138 nmol/l), the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is made without the need for a synACTHene stimulation test.

Outside a situation of major physical stress, if cortisol is >500 nmol/l, the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is ruled out and the stimulation test is not necessary.
