In complete forms (called classic forms: no enzyme activity): the clinical diagnosis in little girls is an abnormality of the external genitalia (from clitoral hypertrophy to a male appearance without testicles). The boy's genitals are normal.

In boys and girls, hypoglycaemia can cause hypotonia or even convulsions, persistent cholestatic jaundice and arterial hypotension. Mineralocorticoid deficiency leads to poor weight gain, failure to regain birth weight, difficulty suckling, vomiting, dehydration and even cardiovascular collapse. [Dehydration in children SD-032 [Icterus in newborns SD-048]]

Neonatal screening for classic forms has been systematic in France since 1995 (measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone on blotting paper on the third day of life). [Systematic newborn screening SD-308

In older children and adolescents, the symptoms will be the same as those described for adults (see above).
