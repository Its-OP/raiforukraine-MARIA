'''Definition:''' a disease resulting from a deficit in the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, which may be associated with a deficit in the production of aldosterone and adrenal androgen.

*Slow adrenal insufficiency results from chronic hormone(s) deficiency.
*Acute adrenal insufficiency results from acute hormone(s) deficiency.


'''Two types of adrenal insufficiency:'''

*Primary or peripheral adrenal insufficiency (involvement of both adrenal glands):
**or Addison's disease
**Adrenal cortisol deficiency associated with aldosterone and adrenal androgen deficiency.
**
*Corticotropic or central adrenal insufficiency (pituitary involvement):
**Deficient production of pituitary ACTH leading to a failure to stimulate adrenal cortisol production.
