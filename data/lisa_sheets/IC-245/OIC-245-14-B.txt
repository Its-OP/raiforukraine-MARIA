Monitoring is mainly clinical (+++): fatigue, weight, blood pressure (lying and standing).

'''Signs of underdosing:'''

* fatigue (but non-specific),
* orthostatic hypotension,
* fatigue
* nausea, etc

Signs of hydrocortisone and/or fludrocortisone overdose

* Swelling and redness of the face,
* oedema of the lower limbs
* weight gain
* HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE

There is no need to measure cortisol or ACTH to adjust the dose of hydrocortisone +++.

If necessary, the dose of fludrocortisone can be adjusted with the aid of a renin assay (high renin = underdose, low renin = overdose) and a blood ionogram.


In the long term, consider a bone, metabolic and cardiovascular assessment in the event of hydrocortisone overdose.
