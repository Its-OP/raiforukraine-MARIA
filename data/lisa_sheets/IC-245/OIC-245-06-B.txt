In the case of adrenal insufficiency, ACTH is measured at 8 o'clock in the morning because it follows the nycthemeral rhythm of cortisol and this is the time when the value is highest.


Once the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency has been made, ACTH is used to diagnose the aetiology of adrenal insufficiency:

* if ACTH is high, this is primary adrenal insufficiency
* if ACTH is normal or low in relation to low cortisol, it is corticotropic insufficiency
