{| class="wikitable"
|Causes
|Clinical features
|Paraclinical
|-
|Autoimmune cortical shrinkage
|>80% of aetiologies

Women > Men

Family and personal history of autoimmune diseases
<br />
|Positive anti-21-hydroxylase autoantibodies

Atrophic adrenal glands on CT scan
|-
|Bilateral adrenal tuberculosis
<10% of cases in Europe

Immunocompromised or from an endemic country

History of tuberculosis
|Adrenal glands increased in size in the initial phase, then atrophied and calcified (non-systematic signs)
|-
|drug-induced
|Context of :

- bilateral adrenalectomy

- treatment with synthetic anticortisolic agents
|
|-
|Bilateral adrenal lesions
|<Bilateral metastases</nowiki>.

- Adrenal lymphoma
|Bilateral adrenal masses
|-
|Vascular causes
|<Adrenal necrosis</nowiki>.

- bilateral adrenal thrombosis

Context: shock, antiphospholipid syndrome, pregnancy, meningococcal meningitis, anticoagulant therapy
|Hypovascularly enlarged adrenal glands
|-
|Infectious causes
|Advanced HIV infection: adrenal localisation of opportunistic infection
