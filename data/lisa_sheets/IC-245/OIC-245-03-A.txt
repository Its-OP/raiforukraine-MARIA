'''1. clinical signs'''

General signs are more marked in primary adrenal insufficiency (=peripheral adrenal insufficiency=affects both adrenal glands), particularly hypotension and digestive signs.

<u>Glucocorticoid (Cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (Aldosterone) deficiency</u>.

The 3 A's always present:

*Asthenia [[Asthenia SD-021]]
*Weight loss, [[Weight loss SD-017]]
*Anorexia, but retained an appetite for salt

Other signs :

*Initially orthostatic arterial hypotension with tachycardia (due to extracellular dehydration).
*Nausea. The appearance of vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain should raise fears of acute adrenal insufficiency ;
*'''<u>Melanoderma</u>''' and slate patches on the oral mucosa.
*Symptoms of possible depression


'''2.       Biological signs (see table in the semiology chapter)'''

NB: apart from decompensations, hypoglycaemia is rare and the ionogram is normal or with a tendency to <u>hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia.</u>
