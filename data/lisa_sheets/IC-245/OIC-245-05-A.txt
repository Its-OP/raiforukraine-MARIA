The definitive diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency is based on the measurement of cortisol at 8 o'clock, the time when cortisol is highest:

*low cortisol levels (indicatively < 50 ng/ml or 138 nmol/l) = adrenal insufficiency.

*cortisol > 180 ng/ml (500 nmol/l) = normal cortisol = adrenal insufficiency eliminated.

<br />

*Between these two values a stimulation test is performed, for example the synACTHene test:

If cortisol 60 minutes after injection is < 180 ng/ml (500 mmol/l) = adrenal insufficiency

If cortisol 60 minutes after injection is > 180 ng/ml (500 mmol/l) = no adrenal insufficiency
