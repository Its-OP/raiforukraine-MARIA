The most frequent cause is the interruption of prolonged corticosteroid therapy ([[Prescribe systemic or local corticosteroids SD-251]]) :

* During oral corticosteroid therapy, the pituitary-adrenal axis is constantly slowed down.
* the adrenocortical axis does not recover immediately on discontinuation of a dose > 7 mg prednisone equivalent for 3 to 4 weeks.
* It is also possible to use routes of administration other than the oral route: percutaneous corticosteroid therapy, intramuscular corticosteroid therapy (delayed-acting forms), inhaled corticosteroid therapy +++.
* During a reduction in corticosteroid therapy, decompensation may occur if the dose is less than 5 mg prednisone equivalent.


The other most common cause is tumours of the hypothalamic-pituitary region. (see [[Pituitary adenoma]]).
