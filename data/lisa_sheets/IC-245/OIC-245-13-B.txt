Therapeutic education concerns the patient and those around him ([[Explaining a treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent) SD-352]])

**a glucocorticoid: hydrocortisone (Hydrocortisone Roussel® 10 mg) usually given in 2 or 3 doses in primary adrenal insufficiency (see Figure 2)
**a mineralocorticoid: fludrocortisone (Flucortac®). Not necessary in corticotropic insufficiency.
*normosodium diet (this is a replacement treatment, not a corticosteroid treatment);
*laxatives and diuretics should be avoided;

2. Carry with you :

*an adrenal insufficiency card with emergency recommendations;
*hydrocortisone tablets and, in the case of mineralocorticoid deficiency, fludrocortisone tablets;

*know how to identify risk situations and symptoms of incipient acute adrenal insufficiency;
