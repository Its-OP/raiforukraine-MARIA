Acute adrenal insufficiency is ''a vital pathology, an extreme emergency''.

Treatment is started as soon as the diagnosis is suspected, even without diagnostic certainty. Hormone levels (cortisol, ACTH) can be measured at a later stage if they are not taken just before emergency treatment. They should not delay treatment.
