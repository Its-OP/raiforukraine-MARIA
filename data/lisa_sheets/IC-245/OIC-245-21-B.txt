Principle of increasing hydrocortisone doses in cases of stress in adults :

*2 tablets of hydrocortisone 10 mg as soon as the triggering factor occurs, regardless of the time of day, then 2 tablets morning, noon and night until recovery/restoration ad integrum (minimum 60 mg per 24 hours in three or four doses, including one dose taken at night).
*fludrocortisone doses are not modified in the event of stress.

In children:

*The dose of hydrocotrisone is tripled, taken in the morning, at midday and in the evening, as soon as the triggering factor occurs.
*The dose of fludrocortisone is not modified in the event of stress.
