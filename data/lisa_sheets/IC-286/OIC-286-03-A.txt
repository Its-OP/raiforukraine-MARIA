Acute diarrhoea is an extremely frequent reason for consulting a general practitioner (5% of the French population each year, i.e. 3 million consultations). Most cases are self-limiting and do not require patients to seek medical attention (around 20 million French people suffer from acute gastroenteritis every year). Acute traveller's diarrhoea, or "turista", affects between 50 and 200 million people every year.
