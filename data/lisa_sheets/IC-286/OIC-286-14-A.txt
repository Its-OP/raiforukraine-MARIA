Management depends on the degree of dehydration:

- if mild dehydration: oral rehydration solution and return home

- if moderate dehydration :

* hospitalisation if haemodynamic or neurological problems, incoercible vomiting, inability to drink ORS
* ORS ad libitum in small quantities
* clinical reassessment

- if severe dehydration (weight loss > 10%):

* hospitalisation
* vascular filling if shock
* continuous IV or enteral rehydration
* ORS relay as soon as possible

ORS has a precise composition of electrolytes and sugars with an appropriate osmolarity. It should be taken early, as much as required and in small quantities.

The effectiveness of drug treatments (racecadotril, etc) is very limited.

Renutrition must be early and diversified
