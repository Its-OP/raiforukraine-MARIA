Diarrhoea is almost exclusively of viral origin in children (mainly rotavirus).

It is essential to look for signs of dehydration (weight ++) and hypovolaemic shock.

In mild forms, no further investigations are required. In the most severe forms, a blood ionogram and assessment of renal function are necessary. Coproculture is only indicated if the patient has returned from a trip to an endemic area, is in a severe septic state, is immunocompromised, has a history of TIAC or has not improved.
