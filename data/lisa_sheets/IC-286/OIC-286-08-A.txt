Norovirus (shellfish) is one of the most common causes of CFTI, with an incubation period of 24-48 hours, and a presentation of vomiting, abdominal pain and rarely febrile diarrhoea.

Shigella", responsible for dysenteric syndrome, and "Vibrio cholerae", causing major watery secretory diarrhoea with a toxin mechanism, mainly affect developing countries. Diarrhoea associated with fever, especially if there are neurological disorders, on return from an endemic region, should rule out malaria. Traveller's diarrhoea/turista is frequently linked to Escherichia coli (enteroinvasive or enterotoxigenic strains), Salmonella, Norovirus and amoebae.
