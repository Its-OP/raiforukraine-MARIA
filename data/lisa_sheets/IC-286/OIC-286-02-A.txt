Dysenteric syndrome indicates the presence of lesions of the colonic or ileocolic mucosa (ulcers or ulcerations), most often caused by an infectious agent (entero-invasive germ), or more rarely by another inflammatory, toxic or ischaemic mechanism.

Rectal syndrome is a sign that the disease is confined to the rectum.

In both cases, there are pathological afecal evacuations: mucous and/or bloody and/or accompanied by mucus and/or pus with false needs.

There may be tenesmus (painful tension in the anal region following or preceding evacuation) and a sensation of a rectal foreign body.

If the sigmoid is affected, there may be epiduritis (spasm-like pain in the left iliac fossa) which precedes evacuation and is relieved by it.

In the case of rectal syndrome, constipation may occur. In the case of more extensive involvement of the colon, diarrhoea (sometimes with blood) may occur.
