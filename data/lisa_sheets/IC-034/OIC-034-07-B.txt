The post-natal period is a high-risk period for venous thrombosis, particularly in the first 6 weeks post-partum.

The factors contributing to this are as follows:

Major risk factors: history of thromboembolism, thrombophilia, prolonged immobilisation.

Minor DRFs: age > 35, multiparity, obesity, sepsis, varicose veins, caesarean delivery (particularly emergency caesarean delivery), heart disease, pre-eclampsia, post-partum haemorrhage, assisted reproduction, smoking.

'''Superficial venous thrombosis'''

An indurated, painful cord in the course of a superficial vein.

May be associated with deep vein thrombosis, particularly in the lower limbs. In this case, an echo-Doppler examination of the lower limbs should be carried out systematically.

Deep vein thrombosis

It carries the risk of pulmonary embolism and is life-threatening.

- Non-specific warning signs in the post-partum period: moderate fever (37.5-38Â°C), inconsistent, unilateral calf pain, groin pain or feeling of a heavy leg;

- Bilateral and comparative examination: slight oedema, warmth in the calf, pain in the calf on deep palpation and dorsiflexion of the foot;

- An echo-Doppler examination of the lower limbs should be carried out systematically, but treatment should not be delayed if there is a strong suspicion.

'''Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis'''

Difficult to diagnose. It often complicates endometritis. It should be considered when endometritis does not respond to antibiotic treatment.

The elements of the clinical diagnosis are not specific: significant pelvic pain, urinary signs (dysuria, pollakiuria, urine retention), intestinal signs (bloating, tenesmus), pain of a parameter on vaginal touch (very inconstant). It is their association with endometritis that is suggestive.

Diagnosis by pelvic CT scan (or MRI) with injection of contrast medium.

Cerebral thrombophlebitis

A rare but severe complication that should be suspected in the presence of symptoms of intracranial hypertension (headache, vomiting, consciousness disorders) and/or a focal neurological deficit or even a convulsive seizure. Headache is the most frequent symptom, and often the first sign of cerebral thrombophlebitis.

Diagnosis is based on cerebral imaging, in particular MRI, which enables the thrombus and its location to be visualised.
