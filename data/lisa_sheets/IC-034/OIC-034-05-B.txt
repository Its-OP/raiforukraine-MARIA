Atonia: Obtain good uterine retraction by using uterotonics (oxytocin or prostaglandin analogues in the absence of contraindication), after ensuring that the uterus is empty. In the event of retention, curettage with or without hysteroscopy should be considered.

Haemorrhagic endometritis: treatment of endometritis + uterotonics.

Placental retention: careful curettage under ultrasound control +/- hysteroscopy. The main risk is uterine synechia. Antibiotic prophylaxis is generally prescribed in the event of placental retention remote from delivery.
