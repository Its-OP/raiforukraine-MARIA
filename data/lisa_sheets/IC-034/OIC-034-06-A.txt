The basic principle is prevention: early lifting of all newborns, venous restraint for a wide range of indications (particularly if the venous condition is poor), preventive treatment with heparin depending on the extent of the risk factors.

Treatment of thrombotic complications in the post-partum period :
{| class="wikitable"
|Type of thrombophlebitis
|Treatment
|-
|Superficial
|Local anti-inflammatories

Venous restraint. Anticoagulants are not routinely used.
|-
|Deep
|Low molecular weight heparin, venous restraint (force III), early relay with antivitamin K*.
|-
|Pelvic
|Appropriate antibiotic therapy (intravenous, broad spectrum including staphylococcus), hypocoagulant dose heparin therapy (effective for the duration of antibiotic therapy, over a minimum period of 7 to 14 days). Recourse to VKA therapy will be assessed according to the location and extent of the thrombus.
|-
|Cerebral
|Anticoagulation and symptomatic management of cerebral oedema (mannitol, corticosteroid therapy).
|}
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The minimum duration of VKA treatment is 3 months in cases of deep thrombophlebitis.

Warfarin (Coumadin<sup>®</sup>) and acenocoumarol (Sintrom<sup>®</sup>) do not diffuse into breast milk and can therefore be used during breastfeeding, unlike fluindione (Préviscan<sup>®</sup>).
