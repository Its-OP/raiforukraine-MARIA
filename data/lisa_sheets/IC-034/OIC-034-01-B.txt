The post-natal period begins 2 hours after childbirth and ends with the return from childbirth, approximately 6 weeks later (40 days) if the patient is not breastfeeding.

The main post-partum maternal complications are haemorrhage (of uterine origin), infection (endometritis, urinary tract infection, breast infection, scar infection), thromboembolism and psychosis (item 67).


The main clinical features to look out for are :

- General signs: heart rate, BP, temperature, general condition and pain;

- Breasts: tension, pain, cracks, signs of inflammation (item 33) ;

- Involution of the uterine globe: height and consistency of the uterus ;

- perineal healing ;

- Lochia (bloody post-partum vaginal discharge): abundance, appearance, odour ;

- Lower limbs: look for signs of phlebitis;

- The urinary system: functional signs, appearance of urine, resumption of micturition;

- After a caesarean section: scarring, pain, resumption of bowel movements, urination.
