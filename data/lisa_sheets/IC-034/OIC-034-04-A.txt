In the event of post-partum genital haemorrhage, a pelvic ultrasound scan should be performed as part of the aetiological work-up, and uterine vacuity should be checked.

A distinction is made between :

- Early haemorrhage occurring within 24 hours of birth and defined as blood loss of at least 500ml. The main causes are uterine atony, retained placenta or a wound in the genital tract (see delivery item);

- Late (or secondary) haemorrhage, defined as haemorrhage occurring after the first 24 hours and within 12 weeks of delivery (0.5 to 2% of deliveries).

Main causes :

Isolated uterine atony, the most common cause of post-partum haemorrhage (>50% of cases).

The onset is often very early, during the first 3 days post-partum.

Examination revealed: metrorrhagia greater than normal, absence of a safety globe (uterus not retracted, soft, extending beyond the umbilicus), but no sign of endometritis, normal temperature, foul-smelling lochia, absence of spontaneous pelvic pain or pain provoked by uterine mobilisation.

A pelvic ultrasound should be performed to rule out retained placenta (membranes, cotyledon).

Haemorrhagic endometritis (''see above'')

Placental retention

Persistence of cotyledonary or membranous fragments. It promotes uterine atony and/or endometritis.

There are no specific clinical signs. Diagnosis is based on pelvic ultrasound, which should be performed systematically in cases of hyperthermia or post-partum genital haemorrhage.
