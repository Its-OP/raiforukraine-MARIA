Acute postpartum endometritis

Treatment is based on :

- Hospitalisation in the conventional sector ;

- Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy as 1st line treatment without waiting for bacteriological results. Intravenous initially, with a "per os" relay after temperature normalisation, adapted secondarily to the results of the vaginal swab. Antibiotic treatment is continued until 48 hours of apyrexia and disappearance of pain.

- Monitoring: temperature, height, tone and sensitivity of the uterus, appearance of lochia, signs of thromboembolic complications.

The disease usually progresses rapidly with appropriate treatment. If this is not the case, two diagnoses should be considered as a priority, especially in cases of persistent fever:

- Retention of placental fragments

- Associated pelvic thrombophlebitis

Acute pyelonephritis

Antibiotic treatment must be compatible with any breast-feeding (3rd generation cephalosporins Â± aminoside) and continued for a total of 10 to 14 days.
