The main causes of hyperthermia are: endometritis, upper urinary tract infection, thrombophlebitis, and breastfeeding complications (item 33).

Acute postpartum endometritis

Endometritis is the leading cause of post-partum hyperthermia.

The diagnosis of acute post-partum endometritis is primarily clinical:

- often 3 to 5 days after childbirth moderate fever at 38°C, mild pelvic pain, profuse and foul-smelling (fetid) lochia, sometimes haemorrhagic.

- Poorly involuted uterus that is painful to mobilise, with a gaping cervix and abundant, foul-smelling lochia.  

Additional tests: CBC, CRP, blood cultures, ECBU, pelvic ultrasound, vaginal bacteriological swab.

Acute pyelonephritis

The clinical picture and principles of treatment are identical to those for pyelonephritis outside pregnancy (see specific item).

The warning signs are as follows: urinary frequency, burning, right lower back pain radiating downwards, high fever (38.5°C), cloudy urine, provoked lower back pain, positive urine dipstick (leucocytes, nitrites).

ECBU confirms the diagnosis. Renal ultrasound eliminates an obstacle.

Thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs or pelvis (see below): always consider a thromboembolic complication in cases of post-partum fever.


Complications of breastfeeding ([[Breastfeeding|cf item 33]])


Abnormal wound healing (surgical site infection)

Infection of a perineal scar results in disunion of the wound rather than fever. There may be a perineal haematoma (perigenital haematoma) which favours disunion.

After a caesarean section, you should look for an abscess or wall haematoma.
