In the case of gestational hypertension, the risk is progression to pre-eclampsia and its complications. '''(Cf. [[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|182. Urine dipstick analysis]] / [[Proteinuria SD-212|212. Proteinuria]])''''

EP is screened at each antenatal visit: proteinuria is checked (pathological if > one cross on the BU, > 300 mg/24 h or if the proteinuria/creatinuria ratio on the sample > 30 mg/mmol).


Maternal complications of EP can be life-threatening:

- eclampsia

- HELLP syndrome (''Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes'', ''Low Platelets'')

- retroplacental haematoma (HRP)

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

- more rarely: acute renal failure, subcapsular haematoma of the liver, hypertensive retinopathy, cerebromeningeal haemorrhage


Fetal complications include : IUGR, MFIU on severe IUGR or following eclampsia or HRP; prematurity induced for maternal or foetal rescue.
