'''Primary prevention:'''

- eliminating risk factors (tobacco, toxic substances, stopping work [[Prevention of foetal risks SD-312]]; [[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314]]; [[Prevention of occupational risks SD-315|Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313;]]) )

- if there is a history of AP or FCT (morphological assessment of the uterine cavity, bacteriological investigation and treatment of bacterial vaginosis)

'''Secondary prevention:'''

- If there is a history of premature delivery, the decision to perform a cerclage will depend on the type of history and the current pregnancy.

- No preventive cerclage simply because of a history of conisation, uterine malformation, twin pregnancy or an isolated history of premature delivery.
