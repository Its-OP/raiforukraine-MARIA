Biology :

- CBC, CRP (inflammatory syndrome, chorioamniotitis)

- Bacteriological test: ECBU, cervicovaginal swab

- Fetal fibronectin (for some - prediction of risk of delivery)

- ''group/rhesus/phenotype/RAI:'' in the event of imminent childbirth.

- If there is any doubt about premature rupture of the membranes: carry out a test to confirm rupture, such as IGFBP-1 or PAMG-1.

Ultrasound examination :

- fetal biometrics for "fetal weight estimation

- quantity of amniotic fluid

- Cervical ultrasound: measures the cervix for diagnostic (shortened cervix defined by a length < 25 mm) and prognostic purposes.
