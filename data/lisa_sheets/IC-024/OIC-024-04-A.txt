This is an obstetric emergency. Think '''placenta previa (PP) and retroplacental haematoma (HRP).'''


'''Warning: Vaginal touching is forbidden'' until the PP has been eliminated.

# Questioning: pregnancy history: hypertension in pregnancy, obstetric history (scarred uterus), multiple pregnancies, rupture of membranes, notion of placenta inserted low, etc.
# Assessment:

- maternal impact

- foetal repercussions: heart sounds / FHR

- characterisation of the haemorrhage (Cf. ''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|111. Genital bleeding during pregnancy)]''' +/- any accompanying signs :

- permanent uterine pain, EC, loss of amniotic fluid

- palpation of the uterus (soft or contracted), uterine height, abnormal presentation (transverse)

- speculum to rule out a cervical cause

- urine dipstick to check for proteinuria.

3. cardiotocographic recording (RCF) and tocometry.

obstetric ultrasound (foetal vitality, position of placenta, HRP very rarely visible and therefore informative, EPF, amniotic fluid). Caution: ultrasound should not delay treatment in cases of suspected HRP++.

4. Biological work-up: CBC, PT, APTT, more complete haemostasis work-up depending on the extent of the bleeding and the diagnosis.


'''In favour of placenta previa (PP)'''

The clinical signs in favour are :

abundant haemorrhage (red blood, often recurrent) +/- uterine contractions, but without permanent uterine pain (Cf. ''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|111. Genital bleeding during pregnancy]])''''

a flexible, pain-free uterus

frequent pathological presentation (breech or transverse)

well-perceived foetal cardiac activity

Ultrasound :

low placenta inserted close to the internal orifice of the uterine cervix (< 50 mm) or covering the uterine cervix


'''In favour of a retroplacental haematoma (HRP)'''

The clinical signs in favour are:

vascular context (>35 years, hypertension, smoking, cocaine, primipara, pre-eclampsia)

slight, blackish, incoagulable haemorrhage + sudden, permanent uterine pain, which dominates the picture

severe maternal repercussions unrelated to the extent of haemorrhage

permanent, painful uterine contracture ("wooden belly");

non-perceived foetal cardiac activity (dead foetus) in complete forms.
