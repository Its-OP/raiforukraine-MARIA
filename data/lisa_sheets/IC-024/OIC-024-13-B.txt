Resting = not strict but work stoppage

- +/- antihypertensive treatment

Objective: avoid hypertensive spikes and limit maternal complications

- indicated for severe hypertension (SAP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg)

- Blood pressure targets: PAS= 140-155 mmHg and PAD = 90-105 mmHg.

- Caution: no salt-free diet or diuretics - ACE inhibitors and ARB2s contraindicated

You can use :

- 1st line: central antihypertensives (alphamethyldopa)

- in the 2nd<sup> intention (and in cases of pre-eclampsia):

- calcium-channel blockers (nicardipine, nifedipine),

- alpha-blockers (urapidil),

- alpha and beta-blockers (labetalol, which has fewer side-effects than beta-blockers and is most often combined when dual therapy is required).
