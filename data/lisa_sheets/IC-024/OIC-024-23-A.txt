The examination has two objectives:

- look for "warning signs" of a specific aetiology: upper urinary tract infection (+++), listeriosis, chorioamniotitis, ENT infection (strep throat), influenza, signs of appendicitis or cholecystitis;

- assess the obstetrical impact: PAD, premature rupture of membranes.

Questioning

- predisposing antecedents (recurrent UTIs or uropathies, chronic illnesses, immunodepression, smoking, etc.);

- ongoing ''treatments'' ;
