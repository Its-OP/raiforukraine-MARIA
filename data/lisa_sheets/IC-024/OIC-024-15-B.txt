In the postpartum period, complications are still possible (hypertensive crisis, pre-eclampsia and its complications) and it can sometimes take several weeks for the hypertension to disappear++.

So :

- Close monitoring and gradual discontinuation of antihypertensive treatment (o''bjectives'': PAS < 150 mmHg and PAD < 100 mmHg

- If breast-feeding, give preference to: beta-blockers (labetalol, propranolol); calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, nifedipine); alphamethyldopa; converting enzyme inhibitors (benazepril, captopril, enalapril, quinapril) if the patient is not breast-feeding.

- At discharge: "microprogestins" and "progestins" or non-hormonal contraception if hypertension not stabilised.

- At the postnatal consultation: inform the patient of the subsequent cardiovascular and renal risk + coordinated multidisciplinary follow-up

- Three months after delivery: vasculorenal work-up (BP measurement, creatininemia, 24-hour proteinuria [[Proteinuria SD-212]])

Search for and correct associated cardiovascular and renal risk factors (obesity, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, smoking [[Obesity and overweight SD-051]]; [[Prevention of overweight and obesity SD-319]]; [[Prevention of tobacco-related risks SD-314]]; [[Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313]]).

Etiological investigation if hypertension persists.
