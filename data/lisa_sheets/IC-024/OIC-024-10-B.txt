'''On the maternal level'''

The discovery of gestational hypertension = look for pre-eclampsia++.

- The only essential test is to look for ''[[Proteinuria SD-212|proteinuria]]'' on a sample (>1 cross at BU) or on a 24-hour urine collection (>300 mg/24 h).

- A P/C ratio greater than 30 indicates positive proteinuria and should be followed by quantification by analysis of 24-hour proteinuria. If the P/C ratio is less than 30, there is no significant proteinuria.

'''On the foetal level'''

- Obstetrical ultrasound + Doppler'' :

- fetal biometrics with estimation of fetal weight

- assesses growth with comparison to previous ultrasound scans where appropriate

- in the case of IUGR: umbilical artery Doppler analysis (placental resistances) and biometric curves.

Fetuses with IUGR and no umbilical Doppler are at high risk of "in utero" foetal death and acidosis.

RCF: Of limited interest in moderate and isolated hypertension, it is essential for monitoring severe forms and/or IUGR with pathological umbilical Doppler.
