'''Hypertension during pregnancy = systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mmHg on at least two occasions. (Cf. [[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|53. Hypertension during pregnancy]])''''

We define :

- Pregnancy-induced hypertension: hypertension appearing after 20 weeks' gestation, without associated proteinuria and disappearing before the end of the 6th week postpartum.

- Preeclampsia: association of gestational hypertension with proteinuria (300 mg/24 h). It is said to be "added" when it occurs in a patient with chronic hypertension (Cf. [[Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|182. Urine dipstick analysis]] / [[Proteinuria SD-212|212. Proteinuria]])''''

- Chronic hypertension: hypertension prior to pregnancy but sometimes unrecognised. It should be considered if the hypertension is discovered before 20 weeks' gestation or if it persists for more than 6 weeks post-partum.

A distinction is made between :

- Moderate hypertension: SBP: 140-159 mmHg and DBP: 90-109 mmHg

- Severe hypertension: SBP ≥ 160 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 110 mmHg.
