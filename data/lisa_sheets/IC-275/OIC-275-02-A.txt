== Semiology of splenomegaly ==
- patient supine

- semi-flexed legs to relax the abdominal wall

- gentle palpation synchronised with breathing

- identification of a ''[[Abdominal mass SD-008|abdominal mass]]''' of the left hypochondrium

- the mass is lowered during deep inspiration

- may extend beyond the umbilicus if large (left iliac fossa)

- mattness on percussion

- can be palpated in the right lateral decubitus position, with the patient's left arm elevated and the examiner's hands under the hooked costal margin (obesity)

- diagram of the size of the spleen, with subxiphoid and subcostal measurements on the midclavicular line, for evolutionary follow-up.
<br />

== D'''iagnostic''' '''clinical''' ==
- tumour of the stomach, pancreas or left colon: but are not mobile on inspiration ;

- tumour of the left lobe of the liver: but rarely extends to the whole of the left hypochondrium ;

- tumour of the left kidney: but in this case there is a lumbar contact.
<br />

== C''ircumstances of discovery'' ==
- by chance or during a routine physical examination, splenomegaly being most often painless, or on an abdominal imaging examination requested for another reason (''[[Discovery of an abdominal anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-224|découverte d'une anomalie abdominale à l'examen d'imagerie médicale]]'') ;

- in a context of''''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]'', of altered general condition (''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]]'', '''[[Emaigrissement SD-017|amaigrissement]]'''), d''''[[Ictère SD-047|ictère]]''', d''''[[Adénopathies unique ou multiples SD-016|adénopathies unique ou multiples]]''' ;

- in the context of a known pathology, in particular hepatopathy or haemopathy;

- abdominal heaviness (in the absence of complications, splenomegaly is generally painless).
