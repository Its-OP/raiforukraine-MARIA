== '''Portal hypertension''' ==
Any cause of portal hypertension may be responsible for splenomegaly and therefore hypersplenism. Other clinical signs are most often present: '''[[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]]''', ascites, collateral venous circulation, '''[[Jaundice SD-047|icterus]]'''.

Cirrhosis is the main cause, whether of alcoholic, viral or other origin. Portal vein thrombosis and thrombosis of the suprahepatic veins (Budd-Chiari syndrome) may also be responsible for portal hypertension and hence splenomegaly.
<br />

== '''Malignant haemopathies''' ==
Lymphoid haemopathies (except myeloma), myeloid (myeloproliferative syndromes).
<br />

== '''Infections''' ==
Bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infections (look for a fever +++)

- '''Bacterial infections''': infective endocarditis ('''[[Discovery of anomalies on cardiac auscultation SD-018|discovery of anomalies on cardiac auscultation]]''', '''[[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]]'''), tuberculosis.

- '''Viral infections''': human immunodeficiency virus ('''HIV'''), Epstein-Barr virus ('''EBV'''), cytomegalovirus ('''CMV''), viral hepatitis virus ('''[[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]]''', hepatic cytolysis and mononucleosis syndrome).

- Parasitic infections: malaria.
<br />

== '''Chronic haemolysis''' ==
To be considered in cases of ''jaundice'' and dark urine, diagnosed in the presence of regenerative anaemia (reticulocytes â‰¥ 120 G/L), with a fall in haptoglobin, and an increase in free bilirubin and LDH.

- hereditary corpuscular haemolysis (haemoglobinopathies; red cell membrane diseases (hereditary spherocytosis); enzyme deficiencies (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) or pyruvate kinase deficiency)

- acquired extra-corpuscular haemolysis: autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, thrombotic microangiopathies.

== '''Other causes of splenomegaly''' ==
Systemic diseases (systemic lupus, sarcoidosis)
