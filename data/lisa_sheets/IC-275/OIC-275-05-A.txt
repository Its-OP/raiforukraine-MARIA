'''Biological tests to be performed in the presence of splenomegaly (as first-line treatment):'''

- Blood count with reticulocytes and blood smear

o cytopenias or conversely polycythemia, thrombocytosis ('''[[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]]''') or hyperleukocytosis ('''[[Blood count interpretation SD-223|blood count interpretation]]''') in the case of haemopathy or infection.

o regenerative anaemia in cases of haemolysis

o NB: hypersplenism, whatever the cause, may be responsible for moderate pancytopenia, with normocytic anaemia, moderate thrombocytopenia ('''[[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]]''') (with platelet count usually above 50 G/L), and leuco-neutropenia.

- Liver test (ASAT/ALAT/gamma-GT/alkaline phosphatases/bilirubin), in the case of liver disease or viral infection.

- '''Serum protein electrophoresis''': points to haemopathy in the case of a monoclonal peak, to cirrhosis in the case of beta-gamma block, or to certain chronic infections or systemic diseases in the case of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia ('''[[Serum protein electrophoresis analysis SD-193|serum protein electrophoresis analysis]]''').

- ''Coagulation work-up'' (TP/TCA/fibrinogen), disturbed in cases of hepatocellular insufficiency (drop in TP) or inflammation (rise in fibrinogen).

- C-reactive protein (CRP), to look for an acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]'' (infections or certain haemopathies).


- Markers of haemolysis (increased haptoglobin, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and free bilirubin).
