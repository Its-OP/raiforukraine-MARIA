Usefulness

o Objectivise misuse in cases of denial or minimisation (etiological diagnosis of pancreatitis, etc.)

o Addiction monitoring: identifying relapses, motivational and educational aspects

o Not useful for systematic screening or diagnosis of dependence


Blood alcohol level (breathalyser or blood test)

o useful in emergencies in the event of a fall, malaise, behavioural problems or loss of consciousness

GGT (Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase)

o marker of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related liver damage

o poor sensitivity

o poor specificity (to be interpreted in conjunction with the entire liver work-up)

o difficult to interpret if obese or with metabolic syndrome

o decreases from the first week after stopping consumption, and normalises in 4 to 10 weeks.

VGM (Mean corpuscular volume)

o The least sensitive

o fairly specific

o slowly returns to normal (three months after stopping).

CDT (desialylated transferrin)

o Slightly more sensitive than GGT

o very specific

o normalises within a few weeks of stopping consumption
