General objectives can be :

- complete cessation of consumption (abstinence);

- return to low-risk use ;

- or even a reduction in consumption with a view to reducing risks.

In the case of severe dependence, stopping use = the most realistic objective, but it is the patient who defines his or her objective.


Possible strategies:

- complete and supervised cessation of use (withdrawal) followed by continued cessation of use or low-risk use ;

- gradual reduction in consumption until low-risk use or complete cessation.
