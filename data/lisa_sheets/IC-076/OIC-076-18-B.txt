Any disturbance of consciousness, any symptom suggestive of Gayet Wernicke encephalopathy, any need for hydration in a patient with high-risk alcohol consumption => as a matter of urgency, intravenous vitamin B1 supplementation before any glucose infusion ++++. 


'''Delirium tremens: '''

- hospitalisation in intensive or continuing care;

- quiet, well-lit room, regular visits from carers for reassurance and supervision;

- restraint is sometimes necessary in cases of severe behavioural problems;

- treatment with high-dose parenteral vitamin B1 before any infusion of serum glucose and polyvitamins ;

- intravenous rehydration and correction of hydroelectrolytic disorders ;

- long-lasting benzodiazepines (diazepam) in high intravenous doses until sedation is achieved;

- monitoring of vitals, hydration, blood ionogram, creatinine and phosphorus levels.


'''Convulsive seizure:'''

- treatment identical to that for withdrawal;

- systematic high-dose diazepam, tapering off over 7 to 10 days;

- no systematic initiation of long-term anti-comital treatment.
