[Prevention of alcohol-related risks SD-313|Includes systematic screening for alcohol misuse (see above) and brief intervention in the case of non-addictive misuse.


Brief intervention

- delivered individually

- in a short time (5 to 20 minutes)

- can be repeated.

It includes

- reporting the results of the assessment (situating the patient in relation to the benchmarks);

- definition of a standard drink and low-risk consumption guidelines;

- information on the risks associated with consumption, whether personal or situational, which are relevant to the patient, and on any complications already present;

- discussion of the benefits to the patient of reducing consumption;

- choice of a consumption target, if the patient agrees to try to change their current use, leaving them free to choose;

- presentation of reduction methods which can be offered if the patient so requests;

- distribution of written documentation, referral to specialised structures;

- provide an opportunity for reassessment at another interview.

The procedure is carried out in an empathetic, non-judgemental way, with the emphasis on the patient's free choice at every stage.
