Alcohol is a risk factor for many diseases, in synergy with tobacco for cancer.
{| class="wikitable"
|Cancer
|* Strong risk factor:

- Cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract and squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus

- Hepatocellular carcinoma

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Moderate risk factor:

- Colorectal cancer

- Breast cancer
|-
|Digestive system
|* Alcohol-related liver disease

(symptomatic alcoholic hepatitis, steatotic hepatomegaly, cirrhosis)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Acute pancreatitis, chronic calcific pancreatitis

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Motor diarrhea and/or diarrhea due to enterocyte damage
|-
|Nervous system
|* Alcohol-related cognitive disorders, including severe cognitive disorders: Korsakoff's syndrome (favoured by vitamin B1 deficiency), alcoholic dementia

* Deficiency and metabolic encephalopathies:

- Gayet-Wernicke encephalopathy (favoured by vitamin B1 deficiency)

- Osmotic demyelination syndrome (promoted by too rapid a correction of hyponatremia, malnutrition and alcohol abuse)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Hepatic encephalopathy

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Cerebellar atrophy

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Convulsive withdrawal seizures, epilepsy

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Sensitivomotor polyneuropathies

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Optic neuropathy (retro bulbar optic neuritis)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Trauma: cerebral haematomas ;

* Cerebral or meningeal haemorrhage (high blood pressure)
|-
|Cardiovascular
|* Arterial hypertension

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Rhythm disorders

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Cardiomyopathies, left heart failure
|-
|Rheumatological
|* Necrosis of the femoral head

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Osteoporosis, osteomalacia
|-
|Trauma
|* Fractures, head trauma
|-
|Haematological
|*Macrocytosis, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (by direct toxicity, linked to alcoholic liver disease or nutritional deficiencies).
|-
|Metabolic
|* Hypoglycaemia, alcoholic ketoacidosis, glucose intolerance.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Denutrition, and risk of inappropriate renutrition syndrome

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Hypertriglyceridemia

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Hyperuricemia and gout

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Ionic disorders:

- Hypokalaemia (and risk of heart rhythm problems)

- Hyponatremia (and risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome if corrected too quickly)
|-
|Dermatological
|* Aggravation of psoriasis

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Rhynophyma
|-
|Psychiatric
|* Symptoms even characterized depressive episode, secondary anxiety disorders

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Psychotic disorder induced by a psychoactive substance

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Aggravation of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (personality disorders, depressive and anxiety disorders, chronic psychotic disorders)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Suicidal behaviour

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Behavioural disorders, risk behaviour
|-
|Obstetrical
|* Foetal alcohol syndrome and other foetal alcohol spectrum disorders (including isolated mental retardation)
|-
|Genital
|* Sexual dysfunction
|-
|Infectious
|*Infectious complications linked to associated risk behaviour (risky sexual behaviour, sharing of equipment in the event of associated use of other substances): viral hepatitis B and C, HIV, other STIs, etc.

In all cases of alcohol misuse, look for

- Clinical signs of liver disease, neurological including cognitive, functional ENT symptoms

- Undernutrition

- Risk factors for hepatitis or sexually transmitted diseases
