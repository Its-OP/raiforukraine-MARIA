*Tamponnade = Adiastole'': the right +/- left ventricle is unable to fill due to the external pressure exerted by the effusion.
*Cardiogenic shock due to compression of the cardiac chambers (most often the right, where the pressure is lowest) by an "abundant" and/or "sudden onset" pericardial effusion.
*'''Clinical signs:''''
**Chest pain with positional dyspnoea, polypnoea then orthopnoea and cough, sometimes dysphagia, nausea, hiccups,
**Signs of acute right heart failure: jugular turgor, hepatojugular reflux''.
**'''Signs of shock''': tachycardia and PAS<90mmHg, mottling, cold extremities
**'''Muffled heart sounds'''
**'''Paradoxical pulse =''' 10 mmHg drop in PAS on inspiration

*'''ECG''': '''microvoltage''', sometimes '''electrical alternation''' (because the heart swings in the abundant fluid and therefore changes axis)
*ETT:'' confirms the ''compression'' of the right chambers, especially during inspiration and the ''swinging heart'' aspect ''''' the displacement of the septum is paradoxical in inspiration.
*Emergency" because it causes "cardiocirculatory arrest" (due to electromechanical dissociation) in the absence of treatment; ultrasound confirmation requires drainage
*Emergency percutaneous or surgical drainage. Filling and amines while awaiting drainage''''
