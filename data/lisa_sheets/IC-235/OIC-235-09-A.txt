'''Acute pericarditis:''''

* Viral etiology
* Benign in 90% of cases
* Generally corresponds to a non-purulent lymphocytic effusion.
* Typical clinical picture :
** '''recent flu-like episode'''
** Young adult male with no significant cardiological history.
** Frequent recurrence or relapse (30 to 50%)
** Rare tamponade
* Viral and autoimmune etiology is not necessary in simple forms:
** Virology is usually negative: serologies should be repeated at 15-day intervals if there is any doubt (in practice not carried out).
** Viruses involved: enterovirus (coxsackies A and B), echovirus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, Epstein-Barr, herpes, HIV, hepatitis C, influenza, coronavirus (COVID-19), etc.
** PCR on effusion fluid or pericardial biopsy provides a definitive diagnosis: rarely carried out, given the invasive nature of the examination (pericardial puncture) and the lack of therapeutic implications in a benign form.
