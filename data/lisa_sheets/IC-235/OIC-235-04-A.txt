'''<u>Electrocardiogram</u>''':

* Can be normal'', must be repeated
* Early signs: ''PQ undershift, sinus tachycardia
* Diffuse'' non-systematic abnormalities
* Classic evolution in 4 stages:
** Stage 1: ''concave upward ST elevation'', diffuse, no mirror, no Q wave, positive T waves on day 1.
** Stage 2: flat T waves between the 24th and 48th hour.
** Stage 3: negative T waves for the first week
** Stage 4: ''normalisation during the 1st month''.
* If abundant effusion :
** Microvoltage (QRS amplitude < 5 mm and < 10 mm in peripheral and precordial leads respectively).
** Electrical alternation (electrical equivalent of echographic swinging heart) : QRS of variable amplitude

'''<u>Initial biological balance</u>:''''

* Inflammatory markers: CBC, CRP (may be normal or hyperleukocytosis + inflammatory syndrome)
* Markers of myocardial necrosis: ''troponin'' (increased if associated myocarditis, to be looked for systematically) -> ''sign of seriousness+++++''
* Blood ionogram, creatinine (look for renal insufficiency before prescribing NSAIDs)
