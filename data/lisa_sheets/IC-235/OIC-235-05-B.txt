* Percutaneous or surgical pericardial drainage:
** indicated urgently in the event of tamponade or to be discussed in the event of haemodynamic repercussions on echo with blood pressure preserved :
** sometimes also indicated in cases of chronic abundant effusion with no obvious aetiology
** percutaneous or pericardiocentesis, preferable if the patient is unstable, using an ultrasound-guided needle puncture under the sternum
** surgical, to be preferred if purulent effusion is suspected (a larger bore drain can be used)
** In all cases, ''analysis of drained fluid'': bacteriological, virological, cytological >>> contributes to the aetiological assessment.
