Venous approaches are a major source of iatrogenia ("''[[Prescribing and monitoring a vascular approach SD-271|prescribing and monitoring a vascular approach]'''). This is why :

- venous ports should be removed as soon as possible to limit iatrogenicity;

- their indication and maintenance must be reviewed on a daily basis in the light of the treatments and monitoring required.


'''Complications during follow-up'''

These complications may be locoregional or general.

They can be mechanical, thrombotic or infectious.

Their frequency depends on :

- location;

- the clinical context;

- the time required to install the equipment.

'''''Infectious complications'''''

Infection of the equipment can lead to bacteremia ("''[[Positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]''') and secondary foci. Early infections are most often related to insertion and late infections to handling: importance of asepsis +++ during insertion and use ("''[[Preventing healthcare-associated infections SD-311|preventing healthcare-associated infections]]''").

Infectious complications can take the form of :

* inflammatory syndrome<u>prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach</u>;
* CRP elevation<u>prescription and monitoring of a vascular approach</u>;
* suppuration at the puncture site
* erythema along the venous pathway or adjacent to the infusion chamber;
* Isolated fever disappearing after removal of the equipment (''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]''');
* fever when using the equipment ('''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|hyperthermia/fever]'''');
* bacterial discharge;
* dermo-hypodermatitis;
* secondary septic fixation (endocarditis, deep abscesses, etc.);
* bacteremia, septicaemia ('''[[positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]'''').

'''''Les complications m√©caniques'''''

- central catheter malposition;

- catheter dysfunction;

- material rupture with catheter segment migration;

- parietal vascular perforations (associated with extravasation).

Puncture of implantable chambers can be complicated:

* haematoma, sometimes compressive;
* extravasation in the event of inadequate needle positioning, a source of tissue necrosis through diffusion of irritant product.

''''' Thrombotic complications'''''

There are two types of catheter-associated thrombosis:

- fibrous sleeve around the catheter;

- mural thrombosis.
