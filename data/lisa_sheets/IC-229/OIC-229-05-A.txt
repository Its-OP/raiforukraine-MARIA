Removal of the venous access requires compression of the insertion point to limit the risk of haematoma.

Be careful in the event of haemostasis problems and/or an insertion point that is difficult to compress.

Risk of gas embolism when removing a central venous line in the superior vena cava: removal should be carried out in the supine position, asking the conscious non-ventilated patient to stop breathing or breathe out during removal.
