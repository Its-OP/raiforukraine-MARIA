Infectious complications

If there are any signs of infection, the equipment should be removed. The catheter is cultured.

If there are general signs, blood cultures are taken ('''[[Positive blood culture SD-190|positive blood culture]]'''').

The decision to introduce antibiotic therapy depends on whether the symptoms are local or general ('''[[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|prescribe an anti-infective]]'''):

- in the event of fever, general signs of sepsis or even septic shock, antibiotic therapy is initiated

- antibiotic therapy targets staphylococci aureus and epidermidis.

- it is extended to Gram bacilli - in cases of immunodepression, neutropenia or other risk factors

Thrombotic complications

In the event of central venous thrombosis, the catheter may be left in place if it is functional, with prescription of curative anticoagulation adapted to the context.
