A ''multi-professional protocol'' is the expression of a consensus concerning the management of an acute or chronic illness, by several professionals, within a care structure or in a region, and according to the state of the art at the time. It includes memory aids, checklists, prescription aids and facilitates teamwork. It can be used to validate the continuing professional development (CPD) obligation.
