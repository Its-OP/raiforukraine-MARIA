<Multidisciplinary consultation meetings (RCP) are ''collegial'' meetings attended by ''at least three doctors from different specialities'' to reach a decision on the best way to treat a patient, based on the state of the art at the time. RCPs are used to validate the continuing professional development (CPD) obligation.

They are systematically organised in the field of "oncology" to define the diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up strategy for cancer patients. They can be organised in other fields whenever the patient's care is complex and requires a concerted and collegial opinion, guaranteeing the best strategy for the patient.
