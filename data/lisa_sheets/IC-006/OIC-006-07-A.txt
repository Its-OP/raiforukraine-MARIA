The morbidity-mortality meeting (MMM) is a ''collective, retrospective and systemic analysis meeting'' (i.e. taking into account the organisational, technical and human components) of clinical situations marked by the occurrence of an undesirable event associated with care (death, complication, etc.), in order to implement ''prevention, recovery or mitigation actions''. RMMs are part of the ''feedback culture'' or how to learn collectively from mistakes. RMMs can be used to validate the continuing professional development (CPD) obligation.
