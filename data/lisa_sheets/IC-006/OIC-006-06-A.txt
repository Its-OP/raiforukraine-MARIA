The '''''check-list "patient safety in the operating theatre" helps to "make safe" the performance of a surgical operation, by reviewing the situation between professionals at "key moments" in the operation. As in aviation, it encourages the "sharing of information" by "cross-checking", in particular the identity of the patient, the type of operation and the surgical site, the equipment and the risks involved. Other checklists exist in the medical world for so-called "interventional" activities (endoscopy, interventional radiology, central venous catheters, chemotherapy, etc.).
