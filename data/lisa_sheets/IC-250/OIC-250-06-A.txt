The diagnosis of undernutrition has been the subject of Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) recommendations for adults and children published in 2019 (HAS link).


The diagnosis must combine at least one clinical sign (phenotypic criterion) and at least one cause (aetiological criterion).


''Phenotypic criteria for adults under 70'' (one criterion is sufficient)

- Weight loss ≥ 5% in 1 month

- Weight loss ≥ 10% in 6 months

- Weight loss ≥ 10% of the usual weight before the onset of the disease

- BMI < 18.5

- Quantified reduction in muscle mass and/or muscle function (HAS link)


Aetiological criteria'' (one criterion is sufficient) :

- Reduction in food intake ≥ 50% for more than 1 week, or any reduction in intake for more than 2 weeks in relation to quantified usual food consumption or estimated protein-energy requirements

- Reduced absorption (maldigestion/malabsorption).

- Situation of aggression (protein hypercatabolism with or without inflammatory syndrome): acute pathology or evolving chronic pathology or evolving malignant pathology.


'''Once the diagnosis of undernutrition has been made, its severity must be established:'''

{| class="wikitable"
|Moderate undernutrition

(1 criterion is sufficient)

(1 criterion is sufficient)
|-
|- Weight loss ≥ 5% in 1 month

- Weight loss ≥ 10% in 6 months

- Weight loss ≥ 10% of the usual weight before the onset of the disease

- 17 < CGI < 18.5

Albumin levels >30 g/L and < 35 g/L
|- Weight loss > 10% in 1 month

- Weight loss > 15% in 6 months

- Weight loss ≥ 15% of the usual weight before the onset of the disease

- BMI ≤ 17

- Albumin < 30 g/L
