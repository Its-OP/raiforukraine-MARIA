Renutrition syndrome is a potentially fatal metabolic complication that can occur during the reintroduction of nutritional intake in malnourished patients, regardless of the method used (oral, enteral or parenteral).

It generally appears within 72 hours of the start of renutrition.


Biologically, it is characterised by hypophosphaemia, which may be associated with a deficiency in potassium, magnesium and thiamine (vitamin B1).


Clinically, it may be asymptomatic.

Clinical signs, when present, are polymorphous and may combine :

           Cardiac (arrhythmia, syncope, acute heart failure)

Neuromuscular (paresthesias, fasciculations, tetany, paralysis, confusion, encephalopathy, convulsions, muscle fatigue and pain, rhabdomyolysis)


Prevention of renutrition syndrome requires :

Correction and systematic supplementation with phosphorus

Correction of other possible deficiencies (potassium, magnesium), vitamin B1

Gradual start of renutrition


Monitoring :

It is essential to monitor phosphorus and potassium levels before and during the first few days following the start of renutrition.
