When it comes to undernutrition, we talk about risk situations rather than risk factors.

At-risk situations include all severe or chronic pathologies in which intakes do not cover nutritional requirements.

An energy deficit occurs when the input is chronically less than the output.

A decrease in entries corresponds to two situations:

reduced food intake (by far the most common situation)

digestive malabsorption.

An increase in outflows can result from

an increase in total daily energy expenditure (which is rare)

a loss of energy substrates

digestive losses (exudative enteropathy),

urine loss (glycosuria, nephrotic syndrome)

skin losses (extensive skin lesions including burns).
