As children are still growing, the IOTF (International Obesity Task Force) curves for weight and weight for height and weight for age (BMI) are used in the child's health record.


''Phenotypic criteria for children'' (< 18 years) (one criterion is sufficient)


- Weight loss ≥ 5% in 1 month

- Weight loss ≥ 10% in 6 months

- Weight loss ≥ 10% of the usual weight before the onset of the disease

- BMI < IOTF curve 18.5 (HAS link)

- Weight stagnation leading to a weight 2 lanes below the usual lane (weight curve)


Aetiological criteria'' (one criterion is sufficient) :

- Reduction in food intake ≥ 50% for more than 1 week, or any reduction in intake for more than 2 weeks in relation to quantified usual food consumption or estimated protein-energy requirements

- Reduced absorption (maldigestion/malabsorption).

- Situation of aggression (protein hypercatabolism with or without inflammatory syndrome): acute pathology or evolving chronic pathology or evolving malignant pathology.


'''Once the diagnosis of undernutrition has been made, its severity must be established:'''

|Moderate undernutrition

|Severe undernutrition

(1 criterion is sufficient)
|-
|- Weight loss ≥ 5% and ≤ 10% in 1 month

- Weight loss ≥ 10% and ≤ 15% in 6 months

- IOTF17 curve < BMI < IOTF18.5 curve

- Weight stagnation leading to a weight between 2 and 3 lanes below the usual lane (weight curve)
|- Weight loss > 10% in 1 month

- Weight loss > 15% in 6 months

- BMI ≤ IOTF 17 curve

- Weight stagnation resulting in a weight at least 3 lanes below the usual lane (weight curve)

- Statural decline (with loss of at least 1 lane compared to usual height)
