Any clinical suspicion of pertussis requires confirmation, and this is mandatory if a person at risk has been exposed.

It must be ''biological'' (if the sample can be taken in time) or ''epidemiological'' (confirmed case in close contacts).

'''Indications for sampling''' :

* A patient who has been symptomatic for less than 21 days
* Or a contact individual of an index case who has been symptomatic for more than 21 days.

'''Prélèvement''' :

* The best specimen for diagnosing pertussis is a nasopharyngeal aspirate. If there are no secretions on aspiration, a nasopharyngeal swab can be taken.
* Or collection of cough mucus

'''Identification methods''' :

* PCR is the method of choice for diagnosing pertussis = Bordetella PCR (good sensitivity and specificity).
* A possible alternative is culture on specific media (Bordet-Gentou or Regan Lowe). '''Culture is delicate''' because of the fragility and nutritional requirements of ''B. pertussis''. Its sensitivity does not exceed 60% in the catarrhal phase and 10% in the coughing phase.

Serology has no place in the diagnosis of pertussis.
