Bordetella pertussis produces a number of virulence factors, the most important of which are toxins and/or adhesins:

* The main one is ''pertussis toxin'', which is the only virulence factor synthesised exclusively by ''Bordetella pertussis'' (''Bordetella parapertussis'' has the toxin genes but does not express it).
* L''''hemagglutinin filamentous'' (adhesin involved in interaction with host cells)
