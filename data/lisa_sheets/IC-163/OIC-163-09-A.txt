The vaccination schedule has 3 parts:

'''Children and young adults: the "cocooning" strategy'''

Check vaccinations and, if necessary, re-vaccinate individuals at risk of being in close contact with one or more future infants:

* In adults planning to have children
* During pregnancy for siblings and spouses
* In the immediate post-partum period for the mother (if possible before leaving the maternity hospital, even if breast-feeding)
* Persons likely to be in close and lasting contact with the unborn child during the first 6 months of life, if the vaccination has not been updated previously (grandparents, etc.).

'''In the workplace'''

The strategy is similar, with vaccination recommended for :

* All healthcare workers
* People working in close and repeated contact with infants under 6 months of age
* medical and paramedical students
* Early childhood professionals
