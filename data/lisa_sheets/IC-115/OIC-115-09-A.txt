|-
|'''Maculopapular exanthema''''
|Polymorphism of lesions associating

<nowiki>*</nowiki>isolated macules, with intervals of healthy skin (morbilliform rash)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>maculopapular exanthema: maculopapular exanthema, morbilliform (persistence of intervals of healthy skin) or scarlatiniform (without intervals of healthy skin)

<nowiki>*</nowiki> usual absence of enanthema
|4-14 days
|-
|'''Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)'''
|*scarlatiniform, sheet-like erythema, predominant in the large folds (armpits, groin...), surmounted by amicrobial pustules.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>fever, altered general condition

<nowiki>*</nowiki>rare mucosal damage
|1 to 11 days
|-
|'''Urticaria'''
|Rash of oedematous papules surrounded by an erythematous halo, pruritic, labile in time and space.
|minutes, hours
|-
|''Toxic epidermal necrolysis'''
|State phase

<nowiki>*</nowiki> multifocal mucosal erosions

<nowiki>*</nowiki>cutaneous bubbles; more or less confluent with skin flaps, positive Nikolsky's sign
<br />
|4 to 28 days
|-
|''Fixed erythema pigmented'''
|*From 1 to 10 rounded erythematous macules, a few centimetres in diameter, often painful and infiltrated, becoming plaques,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Preferential location: genitals or labia

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Bullous and generalised evolution possible.
|<48 hours

|'''Phototoxicity'''
|Erythema of the solar erythema type ("sunburn") limited to photo-exposed areas, sometimes associated with vesiculo-bullous lesions.
|several hours after exposure to the sun
|-
|'''Photoallergy''''
|Polymorphic rash, predominantly eczematous and pruritic, beginning in photo-exposed areas but extending to photo-protected areas.
<br />
|7 to 21 days
|-
|Psoriasiform reactions
|Erythematosquamous lesions, more or less pustular, simulating psoriasis (or eczema) in 5% of patients treated with biomedications (mainly anti TNF alpha).

Palmar location, mainly on the scalp
<br />
|Several weeks to several months of treatment
|-
|''Acneiform reactions'''
|Papulo-pustular lesions of the face and trunk, specific toxicity of anti-EGFR targeted therapies.
|
|-
|'''Lupus'''
|Erythematous, more or less erosive, annular subacute lupus lesions of the décolleté and back.
|Several weeks to several months of treatment.
