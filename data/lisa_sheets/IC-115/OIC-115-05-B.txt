Certain viral infections are factors in the development of toxidermia:

- HIV infection increases the risk of toxidermia;

- Drug hypersensitivity syndrome (or DRESS) is associated with reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV6, HHV7, EBV and CMV);

- immunosuppression, whatever its cause, is a factor in the development of toxidermia.
