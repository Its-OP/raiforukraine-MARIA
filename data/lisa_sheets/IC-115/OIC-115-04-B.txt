Skin eruption triggered by exposure to the sun; photodistributed lesions i.e. localised to exposed areas (face, décolleté, extremities).

Two different mechanisms:

- '''Phototoxicity''', eruption occurs in the hours following exposure to the drug, depends on both the dose of drug and the dose of UVA,

- '''Photo-allergy''', rash surveint after 7 to 21 days following exposure to the drug, may be triggered by minimal sun exposure, starts in the exposed areas and may spread outside these areas.
