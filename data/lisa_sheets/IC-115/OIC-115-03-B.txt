'''Prevalence''' of toxidermia, assessed in a hospital setting, is between '''0 and 8%''' of patients exposed to a drug.

Most frequent immuno-allergic clinical forms:

- maculopapular exanthema'': 40 to 60% of reports of toxidermia;

- Urticaria: 20 to 30% of notifications.

Over 90% of toxidermia is benign

Life-threatening forms are exceptional (1 case per 10,000 to 1,000,000 patients treated).
