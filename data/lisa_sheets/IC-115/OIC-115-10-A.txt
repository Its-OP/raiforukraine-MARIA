'''Imputability score makes it possible to discuss the potential role of a drug.'''

- '''Extrinsic imputability:''' this is the reputation of the drug; knowledge of identical accidents involving this drug

- '''Intrinsic imputability: it is the patient's history:''' compatible chronology (see Table "Understanding the different types of drug-induced skin lesions"), favourable evolution on discontinuation of the suspect drug, history of toxidermia with the same drug; compatible semiology (see Table "Understanding the different types of drug-induced skin lesions") which evaluates, in a given patient, the causal link between the drug taken, the clinic and the chronology of events.

At the end of this process, the suspect drug or drugs are identified and contraindicated (an allergy card is issued).
