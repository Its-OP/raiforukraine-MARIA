Two main mechanisms of toxidermia:

- Non-immunological'' mechanism linked to the drug's pharmacodynamic properties

- Immunological'' mechanism: IgE-mediated ''immediate'' hypersensitivity reactions or ''delayed'' hypersensitivity reactions

Different mechanisms may be responsible for an identical clinical presentation of toxidermia.
