Onset 4 to 28 days after the start of inducing treatment

- Initial nonspecific symptoms: fever, deterioration in general condition, initial mucocutaneous signs: burning eyes, pharyngitis, painful erythematous rash.

- Rapid evolution (a few days) towards the state phase (Figures 1&2) and a typical clinical picture: multifocal mucosal erosions and cutaneous bullae, accompanied by a Nikolsky sign (flakes of epidermis detaching when rubbed against 'healthy' skin); fever; possible visceral damage: necrosis of the bronchial epithelium or intestinal epithelium.

- '''Re-epithelialisation''' in 10 to 30 days, with frequent sequelae (reduced visual acuity, photophobia, pigmentary disorders and scarring, post-traumatic stress syndrome).
