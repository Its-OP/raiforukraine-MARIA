-Decrease in membrane permeability (e.g. mutation of a porin)

-Increase in antibiotic efflux mechanisms (e.g. AcrAB-TolC pump in enterobacteria)

-Enzymatic inactivation of the antibiotic (e.g. beta-lactamases which destroy certain penicillins (penicillinases) or cephalosporins (cephalosporinases)).

-Modification of the target (e.g. modification of bacterial gyrases leading to resistance to quinolones, appearance of a new PLP (PLP2a) in S. aureus, making this bacterium resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics = MRSA).
