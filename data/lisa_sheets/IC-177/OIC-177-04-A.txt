Antibiotics act by inhibiting:

-synthesis of the bacterial wall (e.g. beta-lactams, glycopeptides)

-synthesis of bacterial DNA (e.g. quinolones)

-the synthesis of bacterial RNA (e.g. rifamycin)

-the synthesis of bacterial proteins (e.g. aminoglycosides, cyclins, macrolides)

-the synthesis of folic acid (e.g. sulphonamides)
