1-Determination of inhibition diameters by agar diffusion method using discs impregnated with antibiotics and placed on the agar.

2-Determination of the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration, i.e. the lowest concentration capable of inhibiting bacterial growth):

<nowiki>*</nowiki>by microdilution on microtiter plates,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>by semi-automated methods in liquid media,

<nowiki>*</nowiki>by agar diffusion using E-test strips with a concentration gradient of the antibiotic tested.

3-Specific search for a resistance mechanism :

<nowiki>*</nowiki>chromogenic test to look for the production of a beta-lactamase.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Search for synergy between antibiotic-impregnated discs to detect a strain producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ("champagne cork" appearance).

<nowiki>*</nowiki>molecular biology techniques to detect genes coding for specific resistance (e.g. ''mecA'' for ''S. aureus'', ''bla'' OXA-48 for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae).

The results of tests 1 and 2 are categorised clinically according to the reference system used (CA-SFM/EUCAST): S (sensitive, i.e. a MIC lower than the concentrations of the antibiotic obtained in the organism with usual dosages), I (intermediate, MIC close to the concentrations of the antibiotic obtained in the organism with usual dosages), R (resistant, MIC higher than the concentrations of the antibiotic obtained in the organism with usual dosages).
