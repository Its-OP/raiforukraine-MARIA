Antiretrovirals, or ARVs, work by specifically blocking one or more stages in the HIV multiplication cycle''''''''.

Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral drugs inhibits viral replication without eliminating the virus stored in reservoirs.

Treatment of the infection is based on a combination of antiretrovirals, started early whatever the stage, CD4 T lymphocyte count and viral load, because of the ''benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality and the risk of HIV transmission''.

'''The objectives of antiretroviral treatment are:'''

* Prevent progression to AIDS and death by maintaining or restoring a CD4 T lymphocyte count > 500/mm<sup>3</sup>.
* ARV treatment must enable plasma viral load to be controlled at less than 50 copies/mL, which
** maximises immune restoration
** minimises the risk of selection of resistant viruses
** Reduces HIV-associated morbidity

* 4 objectives of ARV treatment
** Immunological and virological efficacy
** ''Best possible clinical and biological tolerance, in the short, medium and long term'' ** ''Improvement or preservation of quality of life''
** '''Improvement or preservation of quality of life''
** Prevention of HIV transmission (horizontal or vertical)
