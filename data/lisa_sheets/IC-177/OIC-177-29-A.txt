Broadly speaking, there are 3 situations

1/Situations where antibiotic therapy is essential or even urgent (sepsis, bacteraemia, bacterial meningitis, osteoarticular infections, bacterial infections in immunocompromised children, acute pyelonephritis, dermohypodermatitis, etc.).

2/ Situations where antibiotic therapy is necessary under certain conditions

- Lower respiratory infections: acute lobar frank pneumonia, pleuropneumonia

- ENT infections: otitis before the age of 2 or marked general signs, sinusitis in the ethmoidal or frontal areas or, depending on how it develops, bacterial angina.

3/ Situations where antibiotic therapy is not indicated: bronchiolitis, bronchitis, rhinopahryngitis, etc.


Antibiotic prescribing in paediatrics, as in adult medicine, must take account of 3 parameters and their respective interactions, as well as the balance of benefits and risks.

The particularities of paediatric prescribing are as follows

- What makes the host special: Being in development

o The impact of antibiotic therapy on the microbiota is greater the younger the child

o Certain antibiotics are contraindicated (cyclins and permanent tooth discolouration, quinolones and arthropathy, etc.).

o Immaturity of the immune system: more frequent and sometimes more severe infections (in newborns), viral infections that may predispose to bacterial infection or be confused with a bacterial infection and lead to unjustified antibiotic therapy.

o Different pharmacokinetics (volume of distribution, elimination, etc.): weight-based dosage

o Behaviour: close contact with other children, hygiene, life in the community (nursery, school and role in bacterial carriage).

- In bacterial epidemiology :

o bacterial pari sometimes different from adults (e.g. involvement of S aureus in cutaneous infections in children more frequently than in adults)

- Special features of antibiotics :

o galenic form, taste, number of doses/sleep requirements that may have an impact on compliance

o the least number of clinical studies to evaluate antibiotics
