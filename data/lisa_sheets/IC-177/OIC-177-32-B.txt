The principles of monitoring children undergoing antibiotic therapy are the same as those for adults, with a few special features relating to children:

- efficacy monitoring: clinical response in the first instance, possibly biological or radiological response

- tolerance: clinical or biological side effects (biological tolerance, particularly renal and hepatic, in children is generally much better than in adults because of the much lower frequency of co-morbidities)

- dosage of certain antibiotics (vancomycin, aminoglycosides) or in certain cases of severe infection or therapeutic failure

- re-evaluation of the indication = systematic: is antibiotic therapy still necessary in the light of new developments? adaptation to the antibiogram


In the event of failure (persistence of fever, for example), a number of factors need to be taken into account

- administration or compliance problems: in particular, some children have difficulty taking it orally (bad taste, neophobia, etc.)

- poor microbiological prognosis: bacterial infection other than that targeted by empirical antibiotic therapy, multi-microbial infection, non-bacterial infection (virus), resistant bacterium

- wrong choice of antibiotic: poor diffusion, wrong method of administration, wrong spectrum

- emergence of resistance under treatment: microbiological documentation +++.

- factors preventing or limiting the action of antibiotics: drug interactions, abscessed collection (need for drainage ++), foreign material, etc.

- complications: spread of infection to sites not targeted by antibiotic therapy (poor distribution of antibiotics) or organisation of collections to be drained

- misdiagnosis: non-infectious cause
