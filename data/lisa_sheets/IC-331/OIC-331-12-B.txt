Etiological research is a priority after a successful return to spontaneous circulation.

The strategy is based on the diagnosis of a reversible aetiology (hypothermia, toxic, metabolic, tamponade, pulmonary embolism, coronary occlusion, etc.).

Since acute coronary syndrome is the most frequent cause of out-of-hospital CCA, the indication for coronary angiography should be raised on the basis of the clinical context, as early as the pre-hospital care phase, so as to direct the patient to a centre likely to be able to perform this procedure when it proves necessary.
