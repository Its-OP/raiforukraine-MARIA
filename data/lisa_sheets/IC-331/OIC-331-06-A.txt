Ventilation is not a priority for adults. For the citizen, it is not carried out in the first few minutes. In a team, it should be performed using a unidirectional valve bag, ensuring that the mask is airtight, ideally with 4 hands. A Guedel cannula may be used. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation should only be used in the absence of protective equipment, and is prohibited during the COVID period. In all cases, the volume insufflated is low.

In paediatrics, ventilation is an absolute priority due to the high prevalence of hypoxic RTA.
