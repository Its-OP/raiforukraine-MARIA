- No-flow: Period without any flow, the period between collapse (t=cardiac arrest) and the start of cardiac massage. It is a prognostic marker.

- Low flow: period of low flow between the start of cardiac massage and the resumption of circulatory activity or the restoration of correct mechanical blood flow (ECMO).
