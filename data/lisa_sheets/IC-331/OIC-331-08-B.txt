There are 2 types of rhythm during an RTA

- Shockable rhythms: ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT)

- Non-shockable rhythms: Assystolies and electro-mechanical dissociation


In the event of a shockable rhythm, a shock must be delivered via a manual defibrillator (the user analyses the rhythm, decides on the energy to be delivered and delivers the shock) or via an automated defibrillator (automatic analysis, automatic charge +/- automatic delivery of the shock).
