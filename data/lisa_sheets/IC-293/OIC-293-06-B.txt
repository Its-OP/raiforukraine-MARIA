'''''" How to justify and prescribe an extemporaneous examination of a pathological anatomy and cytology sample "'''''

An extemporaneous examination of a pathological anatomy and cytology sample consists of an examination of the sample to provide a result in less than 30 minutes.

The time taken to carry out an extemporaneous examination does not allow an exhaustive, optimal morphological technique to be performed, and even less for additional analysis techniques. Also, <u>the result of an extemporaneous examination is not definitive and must always be verified by continuing the analyses according to the standard process</u> for analysing a Pathological Anatomy and Cytology sample (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B03'').


'''<u>An extemporaneous examination is only justified if the response to that examination has an immediate impact on a procedure in progress.</u>''''

For example, in the course of a surgical operation, it may be necessary to define the tumoral nature (or otherwise) of a lesion, to determine whether it is malignant or benign, to determine the extent of a tumoral lesion (whether or not there is sufficient surgical margin, whether or not the cancer has spread to the "sentinel lymph node"), or to ensure that the sampling procedure has involved sufficient material to allow the analyses to continue.


The need for an extemporaneous examination, its justification and the information expected, must be mentioned in writing on the <u>information sheet</u> sent with the sample (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-A01''). The <u>sample in question must be sent immediately in a fresh (unfixed)</u> state to the Pathological Anatomy and Cytology department (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B02''). The extemporaneous examination is most often histological with hardening of the sample by freezing at -20Â°C and microtome sectioning in freezing to produce a rapidly stained tissue section for immediate observation under the microscope. However, depending on the information required, this examination may also be macroscopic (e.g. assessment of the limits of removal of a tumour lesion) or cytological (cytoponctions, tissue appositions or biological fluids).
