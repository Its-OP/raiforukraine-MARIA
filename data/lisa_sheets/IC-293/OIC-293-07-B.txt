Transmission of a fresh (i.e. unfixed) tumour sample to the Pathological Anatomy and Cytology Laboratory is essential:

- in case of justification and prescription of an <u>extemporaneous examination</u> on this sample (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B05'')

- in the case of a research protocol explicitly mentioning the <u>necessity of freezing tumour tissue material</u> (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B03)''

- in the event of <u>recommendations from the Institut National du Cancer (INCa)</u> to take tumour samples for health purposes by freezing them with a view to molecular analysis ('' cf knowledge objectives 2C-293-EC-B02 and 2C-293-EC-B04'')

o paediatric tumours

o suspected lymphoma

o suspected sarcoma.
