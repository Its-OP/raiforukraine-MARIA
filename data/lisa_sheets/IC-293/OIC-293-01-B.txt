'''''" How to determine the indication for a cell or tissue sample for Pathological Anatomy and Cytology analysis" ?'''''


In the <u>reflection preceding</u> the [[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|prescription]] and the taking of a sample for the purpose of Pathological Anatomy and Cytology analysis, the information expected from this sample and its [[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SD-180|interpretation]] (for example pathology [[Malignant tumours on surgical specimen/biopsy SD-181|tumour]] or [[Inflammatory reaction on surgical specimen/biopsy SD-179|inflammatory]]) must be questioned beforehand.

These expectations go:

- determine the choice of sampling method (''see knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B01'')

- dictate how samples are transmitted, depending on the time constraints of the results and the techniques expected (''see knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B02'')

- allow the transmission of information, clinical hypotheses and requests for specific analyses via the information sheet accompanying the sample. (''cf knowledge objective item 2C-293-EC-A01'')


The <u>picking act</u> itself is always carried out

- by a qualified health professional, usually a doctor,

- in accordance with good practice recommendations for the sample in question,

- ensuring that there are no contraindications to the procedure.

(''see items corresponding to the various samples'')


The <u>drawal</u> may concern

- Tissue: a biopsy or surgical specimen of varying sizes, from a submillimetre microbiopsy to an organ or group of organs (taken for "anatomopathological" or "histopathological" examination).

- cells separated from their tissue: in a biological fluid, or obtained by smear - in the case of a lesion on the surface of a clinically accessible organ - or by needle puncture - in the case of a deep lesion (sampling for "cytopathological" examination)

- sometimes both during the same sampling procedure (e.g. liquid and tissue fragments obtained during the same puncture procedure).


The <u>quality</u> (and quantity) of the tissue and cell material taken and the way it is preserved and transmitted (''cf knowledge objective 2C-293-EC-B02'') will condition the quality and completeness of the analyses that can be performed for <u>diagnostic</u> purposes, but also potentially <u>pronostic</u> (predicting the evolution of the pathology presented by the patient) and <u>theranostic</u> (predicting the patient's response to a treatment indicated for their pathology).
