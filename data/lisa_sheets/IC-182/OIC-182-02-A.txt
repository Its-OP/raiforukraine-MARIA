'''La visite de pr√© reprise :''''

*Remember to ask the occupational physician for a pre-resumption visit (particularly if you have been off work for more than 1 month, but also possible if you have been off work for less than 1 month) if you suspect that you will have difficulties returning to work.
*The occupational physician can then ''anticipate a request for adaptation of the workstation'' (adaptation, training, change of position....) when you return to work, depending on the pathology and the constraints of the workstation.

'''The return visit:'''

*The employer is obliged to organise a ''resumption visit'' for any absence of more than 60 days or for any absence due to an occupational illness.
*The occupational physician assesses whether the employee's ability to work is compatible with the constraints of the job.
*The employer is obliged to take into consideration the occupational physician's proposals (adaptation of the workstation, change of position) and, in the event of refusal, to state the reasons for the refusal.
*The attending physician may propose a ''return to work part-time for therapeutic reasons'', which is subject to the opinion of the medical advisor, the occupational physician and the employer's agreement.

'''Important Note'''

*The attending physician and the occupational physician may only communicate with the employee's consent (no tacitly shared medical secrecy).
