*Remember to ask about the patient's ''current profession'', ''and previous professions (cursus laboris: description of work activities, products handled, protection used),'' particularly for pathologies with a long latency period (cancers, pneumoconiosis, deafness).
*Find out if there is a ''rhythmicity of symptoms'' (improvement on days off work, disappearance during holidays, relapse on returning to work), which is highly suggestive of a work-related origin, at least at the beginning of the course, particularly for rhinitis or asthma and dermatitis.
*Ask the ''occupational physician'' to identify exposures and find out whether there have been or are similar cases in the company, highly suggestive of an occupational origin.
