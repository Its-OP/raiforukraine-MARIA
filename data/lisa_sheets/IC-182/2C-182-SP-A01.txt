*Don't forget to ask about the patient's "current profession" and a description of their activities.

<br />

*Ask yourself ''whether the condition may be aggravated by the work'' (e.g. asthma since childhood and occupational exposure to irritant gases).

<br />

*Ask yourself ''if the pathology could pose safety problems'' (vertigo and working at heights, unbalanced epilepsy and driving, etc.).

<br />

*Suggest that the patient apply for "recognition as a disabled worker", which can help the employee stay in work (financial aid to adapt the workstation or finance retraining).

<br />

*Advise the patient to make an ''appointment with the occupational physician (pre-injury visit),'' '''to encourage the patient to remain in work and''' identify the need for '''any adjustments to the patient's workstation'''.
