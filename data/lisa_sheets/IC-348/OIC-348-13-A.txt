==Specificity of AKI in children (College of Paediatrics)==
ARF in children is defined as an alteration in renal function less than 3 months old: rise in creatinine, fall in GFR and/or oliguria/anuria (inconstant in paediatrics).

The most common causes of ARF in children are :

*Of a functional nature linked to episodes of extracellular dehydration (gastroenteritis, etc.);
*Organic ARF:
*with haemorrhagic or toxic-infectious shock situations may be the cause of ATN;
*with acute glomerulonephritis: post-infectious (streptococcus A or staphylococcus with nephritic syndrome and transient C3 collapse), rheumatoid purpura, IgA nephropathy;
*Post-diarrhoeal HUS or typical HUS: secondary to infection with shigatox-producing E. Shigatoxin-producing coli (STEC) is the leading cause of organic ARI before the age of 3. Presentation: digestive prodromes then state phase with triad: intravascular ''haemolytic anaemia'' (drop in haptoglobin), mechanical (schizocytes) with ''hrombocytopenia'': thrombotic microangiopathy and ''organic ARF''. Possible extrarenal damage (CNS, digestive, cardiac)

Particularities of ''typical'' HUS in children :

*Mortality 1 to 2%;
*30% sequelae of chronic kidney disease;
*Regular follow-up: annual monitoring of BU and BP, ACE inhibitors in case of proteinuria and/or hypertension and nephroprotection for all (see CKD section). Prevention +++
*No unpasteurised dairy products or undercooked beef before the age of 3;
*Wash fruit and vegetables and drink treated water;
*Washing hands before preparing meals and after using the toilet and kitchen utensils;
*In the event of an AEG, avoid swimming in public places;
*Avoid contact with cattle and their environment before the age of 3;
*Declaration of cases to Sant√© Publique France and compulsory declaration of food poisoning in the event of grouped cases.
