o In type 1 cardio-renal syndrome (impairment of renal function complicating acute heart failure) or type 2 (renal repercussions of chronic heart failure), AKI is secondary to a fall in cardiac output and a rise in filling pressures transmitted to the renal vein. By correcting haemodynamic abnormalities and restoring an appropriate cardiac output, renal function can be improved at the same time.

o Progressive sodium depletion, using loop diuretics in increasing doses combined with a strict de-sodal diet (â‰¤ 2 g NaCl per day) and water restriction in the event of associated hyponatremia.

o However, if a patient is already on a diuretic, it is sometimes necessary to suspend it, as renal failure may be due to hypovolaemia caused by excess depletion, unlike in the previous situation.
