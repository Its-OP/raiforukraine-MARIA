Dialysis is indicated as an emergency treatment in cases of life-threatening complications and when ARF is refractory to medical treatment:

*''''[[Dyskalaemia SD-201|Hyperkalaemia]]'''' symptomatic (> 6.5 mmol/L),
*'''[[Analysis of a blood gas result SD-192|Metabolic acidosis]]''' severe (pH < 7.15),
*And/or ''[[pulmonary oedema]]''' resistant to diuretics,
*Urea > 50 mmol/L,
*Decreased diuresis SD-022|Oligo-anuria]'' for more than 72 hours.

In anuric patients, complications such as hyperkalaemia, acidosis and hyperhydration can appear very quickly.
