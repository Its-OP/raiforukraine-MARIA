==A. Acute obstructive renal failure==
Search for :

- Unilateral or bilateral lower back pain,

- Macroscopic haematuria with clots,

- Micturition problems, a bladder globe (subvesical obstruction) or pelvic shielding on vaginal or rectal examination.

Diagnosis is based on the demonstration of "dilatation of the pyelo-caliceal cavities on renal ultrasound". The dilatation is bilateral, or unilateral if the kidney is single (functional).
