==B.   Acute functional renal failure (table 3)==

'''Table 3''' ''': Main causes of functional ARI''''
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Extracellular dehydration / True hypovolaemia''''

Loss of skin (major sweating, burning) or digestive tract (vomiting, diarrhoea, fistulas)

Kidney loss :

- Excessive diuretic treatment

- Osmotic polyuria in decompensated diabetes and obstruction lifting syndrome

- Acute adrenal insufficiency

Arterial hypotension in states of septic, haemorrhagic and anaphylactic shock
|-
|Real or "effective" hypovolaemia
- Cardiac failure (acute or chronic): cardio-renal syndrome, cardiogenic shock

- Severe nephrotic syndrome

- Decompensated hepatic cirrhosis (hepato renal syndrome)
|-
|'''ARF by modification of renal haemodynamics (NSAIDs, Calcineurin inhibitors)'''
|-
|}
In these situations (extra-cellular dehydration or effective hypolaemia) ''blockers of the renin angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors, ARB2)'' are not nephrotoxic but they do increase the risk of functional ARF and oligo-anuria.
