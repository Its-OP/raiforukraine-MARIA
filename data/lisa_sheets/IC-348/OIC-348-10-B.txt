'''Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN):'''

- Profile of organic ARF, usually with preserved diuresis,

- With urinary signs: ''haematuria'', leucocyturia (Â± eosinophiluria in drug-induced causes), sparse ''proteinuria'' (tubular) < 1 g/L,

- Associated general and laboratory signs, depending on the cause of the AIN:''' hypereosinophilia, fever, skin rash or hepatic cytolysis (AIN of immuno-allergic origin)'''''''.
