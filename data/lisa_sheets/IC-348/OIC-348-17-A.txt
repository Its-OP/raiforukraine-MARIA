Treatment is based on restoring normal blood volume.

To estimate the amount of volume lost, you can use :

*Weight variation,
*echocardiography of the heart and vena cava to estimate vascular filling.

Isotonic saline (NaCl 9 â€°) is most often used IV. In mild ARF, oral rehydration (saline diet and copious drinks) is often sufficient.

Monitoring: weight curve, heart rate, blood pressure, resumption of diuresis and blood and urine ionograms.
