|Description=Know how to order a renal and pelvic ultrasound scan to look for an obstacle in the excretory tract, order a blood and urine ionogram to differentiate between functional AKI and AKI caused by acute tubular necrosis, know how to interpret proteinuria and urine sediment in the context of AKI.

Complementary tests play an important role in the diagnostic strategy for ARF, but most of the information is provided by the interview and the history.

==Additional tests useful for the diagnosis of ARF:==

*Increased creatinine SD-199|plasma creatinine]'': rising rapidly in AKI.
*Urinary tract imaging SD-231|imaging]''', preferably by ''[[Urinary tract imaging SD-231|ultrasound]]'', to ensure the presence of 2 kidneys in a normal anatomical situation, to assess their size and the thickness of the renal parenchyma (these two parameters are usually reduced in CKD) and to rule out an obstruction.
*Urine ionogram and plasma urea to differentiate functional AKI from organic AKI due to acute tubular necrosis (table 1).
*Urine dipstick analysis SD-182|urine dipstick analysis]]'' to look for albuminuria and/or "blood" in the urine, to be supplemented by a urinary sediment analysis SD-196|urinary sediment analysis]] and [[Analysis of a cytobacteriological examination of the urine (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU]]''' and a coupled determination of '''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|creatinine]] and [[Proteinuria SD-212|urinary protein]]''' on a sample (table 4).
*Renal biopsy in certain specific situations.

Calculation of the fraction of sodium excreted (''FE Na<sup>+</sup>'' = ClNa/Clcr = (UNa/PNa)/(Ucr/Pcr) x 100 ; < 1% in ARFs) or urea ('''FE Urea''' = ClUrea/Clcr = (UUrea/PUrea)/(Ucr/Pcr) x 100 ; < 35% in ARFU) is sometimes useful in distinguishing ARFU of functional origin from certain parenchymal ARFU, notably NTA.

Particularities of some ARFU: persistence of natriuresis when taking diuretics, hypoaldosteronism, hypercalcaemia or osmotic diuresis... In these cases, a urea EF < 35% is a better indicator of functional ARF.

==Differential diagnosis: ARF or CKD===
In the presence of '''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|elevation of plasma creatinine]],''' three elements point to the acute nature of renal failure:

*Anamnestic: history of renal disease, clinical context and previous creatinine levels;
*Morphological: kidneys of normal size on ultrasound. However, kidneys of normal size (or even increased size) are observed in certain CKD, amyloidosis, polycystic kidney disease and diabetes;
*Biological: hypocalcaemia or anaemia, generally associated with advanced chronic renal failure, are frequently observed in acute inflammatory situations (sepsis, acute inflammatory disease).

Finally, AKI can complicate an underlying CKD.
