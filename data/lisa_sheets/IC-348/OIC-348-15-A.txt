== Adapting drug prescription during ARF ==
Adapting the dosage of drugs eliminated by the kidney (parent compound or metabolites) because of the risk of overdose:

- Cardiotropic drugs: risk of overdose, sometimes fatal

- Hypoglycaemic sulphonamides: hypoglycaemia

- Biguanides: ketoacidosis

- Direct anticoagulants/ LMWH: haemorrhage

- Renin angiotensin system blockers: increased risk of hyperkalaemia

- Iodine contrast products (ICP)/Gadolinium: increased risk of toxicity in cases of renal failure (ICP = NTA; Gadolinium = nephrogenic systemic fibrosis)

- Loop diuretics: reduced efficacy (organic ARF), higher doses required.

It is important to know the metabolism of drugs and their main route of elimination in order to adapt the dosage in cases of renal failure.
