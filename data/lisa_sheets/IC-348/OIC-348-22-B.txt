Mortality during ARF is high, ranging from 10 to 70% depending on the aetiology and the setting in which it occurs.

There are many factors influencing renal and vital prognosis:

* Renal: Level of previous renal function ;

Type of AKI: the prognosis for AKI is usually good. After an ARF phase lasting 1 to 3 weeks, renal function gradually recovers and returns to its previous state. This recovery is due to regeneration of the necrotic tubular epithelium. Nevertheless, a sequel (''CKD'') is possible.

* Vital prognosis factors include the presence of septic shock, associated visceral failure, the occurrence of complications and the setting in which the AKI occurs.
