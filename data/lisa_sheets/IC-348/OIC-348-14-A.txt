==Complications requiring urgent and specialised care==
'''The metabolic complications specific to ARF are:'''

'''[[Dyskalaemia SD-201|Hyperkalaemia]]''': serious, potentially fatal complication, mainly due to reduced tubular secretion of potassium.

*Aggravated by: metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, haemolysis, tumour lysis syndrome or certain drugs (anti-aldosterone, ACE inhibitors, ARB-2, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole).
*Systematic dosage + ECG (to check for conduction problems). Urgent treatment (see item 267).

''[[Analysis of a blood gas result SD-192|Metabolic acidosis]]''': frequent and usually moderate during AKI.

*Cases of severe acidosis associated with ARF: ethylene glycol intoxication (oxalic acidosis), shock (lactic acidosis), diabetic ketoacidosis, functional ARF associated with diarrhoea (digestive losses of bicarbonates) and obstructive ARF.

'''Hydro-sodium overload,''' with extracellular hyperhydration: hypertension and presence of declining [[Localised or diffuse oedema SD-054|d''''œdèmes''']], possibly serous effusions (pleura, pericardium). Risk of acute pulmonary oedema.

'''Denutrition''' due to a lack of anabolism and hypercatabolism of nitrogen in severe forms.

'''Nosocomial infections'''.

'''Hémorragies digestives'''.
