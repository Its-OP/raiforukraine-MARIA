==Definition, positive diagnosis and prevalence===
Acute renal failure (ARF) is defined and classified into 3 stages of increasing severity according to two parameters, the increase in ''[[Increased creatinine SD-199|creatininaemia]]''' and/or the decrease ''[[Decreased diuresis SD-022|diuresis]]'''.

'''ARF is defined by an increase in plasma creatinine of more than 26 Âµmol/L (3 mg/L) in 48 hours (or by an increase of more than 50% from a previous value in 7 days), or by a [[Decreased diuresis SD-022|decreased diuresis]] that becomes less than 0.5 ml/kg/hour for 6 to 12 hours.''' The severity of AKI depends on the degree of creatinine elevation and the duration of oliguria (K-DIGO 2012 classification).

At the onset of ARF, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should not be estimated using the MDRD or CKD-EPI formulae.

'''[[Anuria]]''' corresponds to the absence of urine output (diuresis less than 200 ml/24 hours), it must be distinguished from '''[[Acute retention of urine SD-097|retention of urine]]''' secondary to an obstacle preventing the evacuation of urine.
