==C. Acute renal failure ==
Syndromic analysis can help to identify the type of renal impairment (table 4). The search for the cause is based on an analysis of associated extrarenal clinical signs, the context and additional investigations.

ATN: acute tubular necrosis; AIN: acute interstitial nephritis; AGN: acute glomerular nephropathy; AVN: acute vascular nephropathy.

Acute tubular necrosis accounts for around 80% of organic ARF. They mainly occur as a complication of collapse, shock, sepsis and/or the use of nephrotoxic drugs or products. In practice, analysis of the patient's file allows diagnosis when the context is straightforward, particularly in the case of intensive care patients.
