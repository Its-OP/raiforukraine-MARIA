All AKI, and in particular some parenchymal AKI (NIA, GNRP, toxic or ischaemic NTA), can leave a permanent impairment of renal function (CKD), requiring regular monitoring and specialised treatment. The more severe the ARF, the greater the risk.

It is essential to monitor renal function in the months and years following even a resolved episode of AKI, as this is an established risk factor for secondary CKD, which can progress to end-stage renal failure.
