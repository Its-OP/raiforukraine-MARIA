Treatment of exacerbations is based on

o The use of inhaled BDCA (metered-dose aerosol in outpatients, nebulisation in the case of hospitalisation)

o Systemic corticosteroid therapy (0.5 to 1mg/kg/d for 5 days, PO or IV)

o Use of a nebulised anticholinergic (ipratropium) in the event of severe exacerbation.

o Oxygen therapy and/or ventilatory assistance should be discussed in the event of severe exacerbation (in intensive care).
