Inflammatory reaction in the airways manifested by

* hyperplasia of the mucous glands,
* thickening of the basement membrane,
* vascular hyperpermeability causing oedema of the mucosa,
* hyperplasia and hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells (mainly in asthma),
* bronchial hyperreactivity (in asthma)
* bronchial remodelling (for asthma)

These elements contribute to the obstruction of the bronchial wall and upper airways, and to the hypersecretion of mucus.

There are 2 main phenotypes (clinical-biological pictures) of asthma, depending on the type of airway inflammation:

* Th2 asthma: inflammation of the airways involving, in particular, Th2 lymphocytes and eosinophils. This mechanism is observed in allergic asthma and non-allergic eosinophilic asthma.
* Non-Th2 asthma: inflammation not dependent on Th2 lymphocytes or eosinophils. Neutrophils may play a role in this type of asthma.
