The choice of inhaled treatment device should be guided by the patient's co-ordination skills (necessary for certain metered dose inhalers) and inspiratory capacities (greater inspiratory flow required for powders).

Any prescription for inhaled treatment must be accompanied by instruction in the use of the inhalation device. Inhalation technique should be checked at each consultation.

A dedicated website with videos demonstrating the treatments available is freely accessible to patients and carers: <nowiki>https://splf.fr/videos-zephir/</nowiki>
