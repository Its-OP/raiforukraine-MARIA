The diagnosis of occupational asthma is based on :

# The demonstration of asthma (positive diagnosis) in a patient with or without a history of allergy (adult ''de novo'' asthma).'''   It may be necessary to carry out a non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness test (metacholine) in the case of more atypical symptoms (nocturnal cough, chest tightness, etc.) and normal basal EFR. This asthma usually occurs in the first few years of exposure, and may follow allergic rhinitis, but can also occur at a later date, when a product or manufacturing process is changed, or when exposure is more extensive <br />.
# Evidence of occupational exposure to a sensitising agent, which may be easy to find (e.g. wheat or rye flour in a bakery, persulphates in a hairdresser's), or may require in-depth research with the occupational physician (chemical substances such as isocyanates, acid andydrides, etc.) <br /> <br /> "The evidence of occupational exposure to a sensitising agent
# Evidence of a link between asthma and occupational exposure, which may be clinical (occupational rhythmicity of symptoms disappearing during weekends or holidays), functional (variations in peak flow or FEV1 depending on exposure), or even require a bronchoprovocation test in hospital. <br />

Asthma associated with heavy or repeated exposure to non-sensitising respiratory irritants, such as chlorine gas, phosgene, etc (bronchial irritation syndrome), can also be encountered.

Finally, in a known non-occupational asthmatic, the existence of a "possible aggravation of asthma" associated with common irritant occupational exposures (welding fumes, building site dust, solvents, etc) should be investigated.

Occupational asthma and bronchial irritation syndrome may be covered by the Occupational Disease/Injury at Work scheme.
