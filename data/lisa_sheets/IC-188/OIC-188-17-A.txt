o Short-acting B2-mimetic bronchodilators (SADB) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): treatment for asthma symptoms or exacerbation.

o Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): the most effective background treatment prescribed for all persistent asthma.

o Long-acting B2-mimetic bronchodilators (LABD) (metered dose inhaler or powder inhaler): always prescribed in combination with ICS (never prescribe LABD alone in asthma because of the risk of GAD).

o Anti-leukotriene (montelukast) (oral): alternative to BDLA

All asthma is treated with BDCA as a matter of course. Background treatment is initiated if symptoms are frequent (<2/month). Treatment is adjusted in stages according to the level of asthma control (see asthma control).

If asthma is not controlled with ICS and BDLA, additional treatment should be discussed during a specialist consultation (long-acting anti-cholinergic, anti-IgE immunotherapy, anti-IL5, long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy).
