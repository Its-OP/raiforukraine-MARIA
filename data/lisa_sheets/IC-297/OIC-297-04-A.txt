The symptoms are different from those of adult abdominal tumours, with a recent evolution (a few weeks) and without AEG unless there is an osteomedullary metastasis. However, they are often ''aspecific'', although real emergencies may occur. There is usually an increase in abdominal volume.'''

Neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma and high-grade B lymphoma each account for 30% of the aetiologies of abdominal tumours in children.
