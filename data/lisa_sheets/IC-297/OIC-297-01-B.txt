Childhood cancers represent less than 1% of all cancers.

These are rare diseases: around 2,500 cases per year in France between the ages of 0 and 18, including 1,700 cases per year occurring before the age of 15, 50% of which occur before the age of 5.


'''Distribution of childhood cancers''': 40% haemopathies and 60% solid tumours

The distribution differs with age and the histological types are different from those in adults (embryonal tumours frequent before the age of 5 and no carcinomatous tumours). Brain tumours are the 1<sup>rst</sup> cause of solid tumours.
