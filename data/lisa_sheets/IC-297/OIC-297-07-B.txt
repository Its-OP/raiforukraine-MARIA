|Title=To know the indications and objectives of imaging examinations in situations suggestive of childhood cancer (brain, abdominal, thoracic and bone tumours). The following organ locations are models for applying the general principles. Depending on the location, benign tumours, precancerous lesions and malignant tumours will be considered.
