Half of tumours are sustentorial and the other half subtentorial

Intracranial hypertension (ICHT) is the most common warning sign, typically manifested by intense headaches (usually in the morning) and vomiting. Symptoms can be frustrating, fluctuating over time or even misleading: isolated nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, irritability, school drop-out.

In infants, HTIC may be manifested by progressive macrocephaly (measure the PC and plot it on curves!), a bulging fontanel, a regression in psychomotor skills and, late in life, a "sunset look".

Acute obstructive hydrocephalus is frequently indicative of a posterior fossa brain tumour in children and may require urgent neurosurgical management (endoscopic ventriculocisternostomy or internal or external CSF shunting).

'''Other manifestations''' may reveal brain tumours, apart from any sign of HTIC: visual deficit, damage to the cranial pairs, balance disorders or vertigo, sometimes comitiality often in the form of partial seizures, or endocrine deficit(s) of central origin.

Any abnormal or persistent symptoms should lead to a careful neurological examination, and emergency brain imaging (MRI++) is always requested in the presence of clinical abnormalities.
