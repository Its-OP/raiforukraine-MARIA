- Hospital admission essential

- Antimicrobial = therapeutic emergency

- Choice of antimicrobial: ''probabilistic depending on the suspected clinical route of entry''.

- Parenteral antimicrobial initially

- Bactericide or fungicide

- Combinations (dual therapy) have limited indications, mainly to broaden the spectrum of treatments.

- Antimicrobial treatment is secondarily adapted to :

* Direct examination of blood cultures (Gram stain)
* Species identification
* Antibiotic susceptibility testing / antifungal susceptibility testing
