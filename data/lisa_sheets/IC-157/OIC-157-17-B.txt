'''The elements to be taken into account when assessing the risk of a resistant infectious agent in a patient with a healthcare-associated infection are''' :

* Length of hospital stay
* Selection pressure from prior antibiotic therapy (duration, spectrum)
* Presence of implanted equipment
* Recent history of surgery or endoscopy
* History of colonisation or infection with a multi-resistant infectious agent
* Chronic haemodialysis or living in an institution (increased risk of infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus).


'''In the event of sepsis/septic shock in the context of a healthcare-associated infection without an identified focus, the following antibiotic therapy may be proposed'' :

* A broad-spectrum ÃŸ-lactam active against nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli (to be chosen according to the ecology of the ward and the patient's microbiological history): piperacillin/tazobactam '''OR''' cefepime '''OR'' carbapenem (meropenem or imipenem).
* Amikacin
* vancomycin (if meticillin-resistant staphylococcus needs to be covered)
+/- echinocandin (depending on the patient's condition and severity)
