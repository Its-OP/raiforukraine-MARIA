*Specialist advice is recommended for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
*Monitoring: blood cultures 48 hours after antibiotic treatment.  If positive: look for an endovascular focus
*Associated with endocarditis in 10% of cases = systematic echocardiography.
*In the event of catheter-related bacteremia: look for associated thrombosis using echo-Doppler, in the event of an unfavourable microbiological clinical course (persistence of positive blood cultures).
*Duration of treatment = 14 days by parenteral IV route in the case of uncomplicated bacteremia, without endocarditis, without secondary septic localisation, with early sterilisation of blood cultures.  Otherwise, treatment duration = 4 to 6 weeks.
