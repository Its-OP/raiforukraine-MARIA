Microbiological tests must be taken before the start of antibiotic therapy (including the [[Positive blood culture SD-190|haemocultures]], see below).

The exceptions to this rule are :

- Purpura fulminans

- Patients presenting with septic shock or bacterial meningitis whose microbiological sampling would delay the start of antibiotic therapy by more than one hour.
