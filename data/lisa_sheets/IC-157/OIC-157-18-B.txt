Monitoring of severity criteria (possibility of secondary onset): signs of shock or organ failure, secondary infectious localisations, etc.

Apyrexia obtained in 3-5 days under well-managed treatment, daily search for other secondary lesions

Monitoring treatment tolerance

Follow-up of blood cultures under systematic treatment if: Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, candidemia, endocarditis, clinically unfavourable evolution

If the fever persists, the following steps should be taken:

*Check the progress of the infection: control of the portal of entry, treatment of secondary sites, drainage of an abscess/empyema, removal of colonised equipment, etc;
*Check that antibiotic therapy is appropriate: antibiogram, dosage, routes of administration, spread to infected sites (bone, meninges, vegetations); rate of administration; serum dosage.
*Look for complications: healthcare-associated infections (including C. difficile colitis, catheter-related infections), drug-induced fever, thromboembolic complications.
*Look for candidaemia (fungal blood cultures) if not already done and if there are risk factors.
