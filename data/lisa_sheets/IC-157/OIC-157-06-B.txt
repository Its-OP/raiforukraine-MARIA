'''Microbiological epidemiology of catheter-related infections:''''

- 50 to 60% are caused by staphylococci

- 20 to 40% are caused by Gram-negative bacilli (enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)

- Proportion of "Candida" varies according to the terrain

'''Clinical features:''''

- Prescribing and monitoring a vascular approach SD-271|Suspect for catheter-related infection]] in any patient with a catheter who presents with fever, chills, signs of poor peripheral perfusion (mottling, cold extremities, prolonged recoloration time) and/or hypotension.

- Local cutaneous signs are rare (10-20% of cases).

- The occurrence of fever, chills, signs of peripheral hypoperfusion and/or arterial hypotension after manipulation of the catheter are suggestive signs, as is improvement after removal of the catheter.
