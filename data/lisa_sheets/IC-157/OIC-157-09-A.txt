'''<u>Indications</u> :'''

'''Blood cultures must be taken if bacteremia/fungemia is suspected:'''

A-Fever (+/- chills) associated with one of the following criteria:

*Purpura febrile
*Need for hospitalisation OR fever occurring during hospitalisation
*Special circumstances (asplenia, neutropenia, presence of a vascular catheter)
*Hypothermia +/- signs of organ failure (cf [[Sepsis and septic shock in children and adults|sepsis/septic shock]])
*Hypotension, tachycardia associated with signs of poor peripheral perfusion (mottling, cold extremities, prolonged skin recolouration time).

B-Suspicion of endocarditis = perform three pairs of blood cultures, even in the absence of fever

C- If fungemia is suspected (catheter, febrile immunosuppressed patient on antibiotics, digestive surgery, etc.), blood cultures on fungal flasks are indicated, as these media inhibit bacterial growth, which prevents yeasts from growing.

'''Blood cultures do not need to be taken at the time of a fever peak or when shivering.'''

'''<u>How blood cultures are taken</u>:''''

*Compliance with asepsis rules: hand hygiene, careful skin antisepsis of the puncture area (using an alcoholic antiseptic solution), wearing gloves, etc.
*Puncture of a peripheral vein
*If the patient has a central catheter: concomitant blood cultures on the catheter.
*Inoculation of at least 2 bottles (= 1 pair): aerobic then anaerobic.
*If signs of severity: collect 4 to 6 vials during a single puncture (do not delay antibiotic therapy).
*In the absence of serious signs:
**4 to 6 vials are taken with 10 ml/vial (approximately 1 CFU of bacteria/mL of blood): maximum sensitivity with 40-60mL of blood, so ''the vials must be well filled''.
**To be taken at the same time or 30 minutes apart. EXCEPT if endocarditis is suspected = spread over the first 24 hours.

*In children, if venipuncture is difficult (this is often the case in infants), it is preferable to fill a single blood culture bottle with a large quantity of blood rather than multiplying the bottles with a small quantity of blood.
*Samples should be taken before any antibiotic therapy, except in cases of purpura fulminans.


'''<u>Analysis of blood cultures in the laboratory</u>:'''

*After transfer to the microbiology laboratory, the vials are introduced into the automated system for monitoring (detection of bacterial/fungal growth).
*''If''' culture positive (within 24-48 hours for most bacteria) = direct examination (Gram stain) '''AND''' Clinician informed
*Then carry out the antibiotic susceptibility test (requires a further 24 hours)
*Inform the microbiologist of suspected endocarditis: incubation period 10 to 14 days
*Inform the microbiologist/mycologist of immunosuppressive factors requiring cryptococcosis testing (incubation period 3 to 4 weeks).
*Fungal blood cultures: positive in 1 to 5 days (confirmation of the presence of yeasts or filaments by MGG or Giemsa staining). Immediate communication to the clinician to start probabilistic antifungal treatment.
*Fungal subcultures for identification and antifungal gram: minimum delay 3 days.
*Techniques for more rapid identification of the microorganism exist (PCR, mass spectrometry) but are not available in all laboratories.

'''<u>Interpretation of a positive fungal blood culture</u>''''

* Any flask positive for "Candida" spp or "Cryptococcus neoformans" should be taken into consideration and treated.
* The detection of rare yeasts should be discussed with the mycologist.
* Malassezia yeasts are responsible for fungemia in neonatology.

'''<u>[[Positive blood culture SD-190|Interpretation of blood cultures]]</u> : Contamination during puncture or "true" bacteremia?''''

'''Take into account the number of positive vials and the microbial species'''

*Infectious agents that are ''always pathogenic'' (= always a ''true'' bacteremia): Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other pyogenic streptococci, Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria, Brucella, Pasteurella and Candida.
*Are possible ''contaminants'' (because they belong to the skin flora):
**coagulase-negative staphylococci, Cutibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp.
**In order to conclude that bacteremia has been caused by these bacteria, the following is required:
***A compatible context (catheter or endovascular equipment in place)
***+ At least 2 positive blood culture bottles from 2 different pairs with the same bacterial species presenting the same antibiotic sensitivity phenotype (same antibiogram).
