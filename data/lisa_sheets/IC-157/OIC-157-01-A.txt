'''Microbiological definition:'''

- <u>Bacteremia</u>: presence of bacteria in the blood detectable in a blood culture bottle

- <u>Fungemia</u>: presence of fungi in the blood

- The term "septicaemia" should be abandoned as imprecise

'''We must distinguish and always look for:'''

- Entry point (source of bacteria: mucous membrane, wound, urine, etc.)

- The source of the infection (origin of the bacteremia: pneumonia, pyelonephritis, meningitis, etc.)

- Any secondary locations (osteoarticular, etc.) and any endovascular relays (endocarditis, etc.)


In the absence of appropriate treatment, the risk is progression to sepsis, septic shock and death.
