'''Main infectious agents of community-acquired bacteremia:''''

- Staphylococcus spp. (especially aureus +++): 30%.

- Escherichia coli: 30%.

- Other Gram-negative bacilli: 20%.

- Streptococcus pneumoniae: 10%.

- Other: 10% of sales

- In infants under 1 month and sometimes up to three months: group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, etc.

- In children and infants aged 2 months and over, Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominate, followed by other streptococci and staphylococci.

- Vaccination status influences the distribution of infectious agents.

'''Entry point to look for according to the associated microorganism/infectious source:'''

- Oral Streptococcus: oral cavity

- Streptococcus pneumoniae: lung, meninges, ENT

- Anaerobes: colon, pelvis, oral cavity

- Streptococcus pyogenes: skin, ENT

- Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci: skin and vascular catheter

- ''Escherichia coli,'' other enterobacteria, enterococci: urinary tract, digestive tract, biliary tract, vascular catheter if patients are perfused

- ''Candida:'' digestive tract, vascular catheter if patients are perfused
