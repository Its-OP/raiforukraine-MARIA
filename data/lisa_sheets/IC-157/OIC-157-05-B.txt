- Fungemia = candidemia in 90% of cases

- Serious infection: 30-40% mortality rate

- Candidemia: C. albicans (50-60%), C. glabrata (15-20%), C. parapsilosis (10-15%), C. tropicalis, C. krusei

- Candida is part of the commensal flora (oral cavity and digestive tract) and can colonise several anatomical sites before translocating to the blood compartment.

- Candidaemia is almost always associated with health care and favoured by :

* Cancer and immunodepression (chemotherapy, neutropenia, corticosteroid therapy, organ transplantation),
* Central venous lines,
* Abdominal surgery, stay in intensive care unit.
* Prior antibiotic therapy, malnutrition.

- The most common routes of entry for candidiasis are :

*Vascular catheter
*Abdominal surgery
*Digestive mucosal lesions (mucositis during chemotherapy)
*IV drug addiction

<big>-</big> Other fungal agents: ''Cryptococcus'' sp., ''Malassezia'' (paediatrics) (NB. ''Aspergillus'' does not grow in blood cultures)
