'''Psychosocial dwarfism'''

Lack of care/neglect leading to a lack of nutrients and a hormonal deficit of psychological origin

Treatment and diagnosis a posteriori: removal of the child from the family environment to allow growth to resume


'''Endocrine causes'''

Slowing of statural growth most often associated with excessive weight for height + delayed bone age


'''Hypothyroidism'''

Congenital

Causes: thyroid dysgenesis (athyreosis or ectopy) or hormone synthesis disorders.

Currently, systematic neonatal screening at 3 days of age (TSH measurement) enables early replacement therapy and a favourable outcome.

If not screened and treated (in children born in countries without neonatal screening), delayed growth and psychomotor development in the first year of life.

Acquired

Any age, but peak in adolescence, particularly in girls

Slower growth and weight gain, difficulties at school, classic signs of hypothyroidism (physical and psychological asthenia, coldness, constipation).

Most often Hashimoto's thyroiditis with elevated TSH, low T4l, positive anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies, heterogeneous thyroid tissue on ultrasound.

'''Hypercorticism'''

Most often iatrogenic (prolonged corticosteroid therapy)

More rarely endogenous: pituitary adenoma secreting ACTH (Cushing's disease) or production of cortisol by the adrenals (Cushing's syndrome).

Diagnosis: elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC), loss of the cortisol diurnal cycle and absence of braking in the dexamethasone braking test.

'''Growth hormone deficiency'' (GHD)'''

Congenital

Most often hypothalamic-pituitary malformation

Prolonged hypoglycaemia in the neonatal period

Other associated pituitary deficiencies: jaundice (thyrotropic or corticotropic deficiency), small penis and/or cryptorchidism (gonadotropic deficiency).

Midline anomalies: coloboma, stenosis of the piriform sinuses, anomalies of the palate or uvula

Birth measurements often normal, then growth retardation

Acquired

Any reduction in growth rate, particularly if associated with signs of intracranial hypertension (ICHT), should rule out a hypothalamic-pituitary tumour (including craniopharyngioma).

Search for signs of HTIC (headache and morning vomiting), neurological signs and other associated hormonal deficiencies (in particular diabetes insipidus).

Ophthalmological examination with fundus and visual field: papilledema (related to HTIC) and bitemporal hemianopsia (related to compression of the optic chiasm).

Emergency imaging of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal region (CT or MRI) without waiting for the results of hormone tests

Apart from emergency situations, the diagnosis of GHD is based on a combination of clinical signs (including growth curve), hormonal signs (IGF1 ± pharmacological stimulation test) and radiological signs (hypothalamic-pituitary MRI).

Any pituitary deficiency should prompt investigation of all the pituitary lineages (thyrotropic, corticotropic, lactotropic, gonadotropic ± search for diabetes insipidus).


Syndromic and genetic causes

'''Turner syndrome'''

Rare genetic disease: 1 case per 2,500 girls

Total or partial absence of an X chromosome in the girl: monosomy of the X chromosome (45, X) or mosaicism

Usual clinical presentation :

Intrauterine growth retardation (50% of cases)

Delayed height (adult height without treatment: 142 cm)

Morphological signs (hypertelorism with palpebral slits pointing downwards and outwards, short, wide neck with low hairline, nipple spread, ulna valgus)

Ovarian insufficiency responsible for lack of pubertal development and infertility

Sometimes heart disease (coarctation of the aorta, aortic bicuspidism) and horseshoe kidney

Recurrent ENT infections

Usually no intellectual disability

Pauci-symptomatic forms (linked to mosaics) justifying the systematic performance of a karyotype in girls with delayed stature


Constitutional bone diseases

Disproportionately short stature (predominantly limbs or trunk)

Measurement of body segments: wingspan (approximately equal to height) and sitting height (approximately equal to half the standing height)

Parental sizes may be low if family origin

Diagnosis: skeletal X-rays and targeted genetic analysis


'''Other causes of statural delay'''


'''Statural delay secondary to small birth size'''

10% of children born small do not catch up in height at birth

Children also at risk of advanced puberty and metabolic syndrome in adulthood


'''Simple delay in growth and puberty'''

Most frequent cause of stunted height in adolescence in boys, much rarer in girls (diagnosis of elimination).

Progressive slowing of growth from preadolescence onwards, which worsens at puberty due to delayed puberty and the absence of the growth peak normally associated with puberty.

Family history of delayed puberty often found

Bone age is usually much later than the normal age of onset of puberty (13 years in boys), so the prognosis for height is satisfactory

Simple clinical monitoring if family history, moderate statural decline (statural loss < 1 DS), height within normal limits (>-2DS), bone age delayed in relation to calendar age, absence of functional signs, and normal physical examination.

In other cases, investigations may be discussed


'''Constitutional short stature or idiopathic short stature'''

Most frequent situation (around 85% of cases), diagnosis of elimination

Parental size often small, regular growth rate and bone age in line with chronological age

New genetic techniques (exome or genome sequencing) are making it possible to reduce the proportion of idiopathic short stature.
