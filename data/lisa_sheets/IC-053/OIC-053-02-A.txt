<br />Growth is a reflection of the child's health: any delay in growth should be considered as a warning sign (symptom) which always warrants assessment.


Definitions

* Delayed weight growth :

BMI < IOTF 18.5 curve (curve corresponding to a BMI of 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> at age 18)

And/ or weight loss ≥ 5% in 1 month or ≥ 10% of usual weight

And/or weight stagnation resulting in a weight below - 2 DS of the usual corridor (weight curve)

<br />

* Delayed statural growth :

Height < - 2 DS according to general population curves

And/or size < -1.5 DS compared with the genetic target size

And/or slower growth rate (< 4 cm / year after 4 years)


Diagnostic guidance for delayed growth in height and weight

Analysis of the ''staturo-ponderal growth curve'' allows two situations to be distinguished:

'''1) Underweight isolated or prior to statural delay'''

Ø Imbalance in energy balance: lack of intake or malabsorption, increased energy expenditure, excessive losses.
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Mechanisms'''
|'''Main causes'''
|-
|'''Lack of intake''''
|- Neglect, deficient diets (veganism)

- Psychogenic or organic anorexia

- Vomiting, oral disorders
|-
|Malabsorption
|- Celiac disease, cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA)

- Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)
|-
|Increased energy expenditure
|- Respiratory: obstructive dyspnoea, sleep apnoea syndrome, respiratory insufficiency

- Cardiac: congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy

- Immune: repeated infections, immune deficiency

- Inflammatory: systemic diseases

- Hereditary metabolic diseases

- Hyperthyroidism ''(only cause where underweight is associated with accelerated statural growth)''
|-
|Excessive losses
|- Digestive: chronic diarrhoea, losses through stomas or aspirations.

- Urinary: diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, nephropathy

- Cutaneous: burns, severe eczema, epidermolysis bullosa

'''2) Predominantly delayed stature, associated with weight in relation to height or, on the contrary, excessive weight in relation to height'''

Main causes of energy, hormonal, bone or genetic origin
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Mechanisms'''
|'''Main causes'''
|-
|'''Energy deficiency''''
|Stature delay most often secondary to underweight. Certain pathologies, particularly digestive (coeliac disease), may initially manifest as an isolated height anomaly (without underweight).''
|-
|Lack of care
|- Psychosocial dwarfism

''Lack of care/neglect can be responsible for a delay in weight gain due to a lack of nutrients but also a hormonal deficit of psychological origin''.
|-
|'''Hormonal causes''''
|- Endocrine causes

- Congenital or acquired growth hormone deficiency, isolated or associated with other pituitary deficiencies (always suggest a pituitary tumour such as a craniopharyngioma).

- Congenital or acquired hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis)

- Excess glucocorticoids (most often iatrogenic hypercorticism, more rarely Cushing's syndrome)

- Delayed puberty ''(associated with a lack of pubertal acceleration in growth rate)''
|-
|Bone-related causes
|- Constitutional bone diseases
|-
|Genetic causes
|- Turner's syndrome (always to be considered in girls)

- Other chromosomal or genetic abnormalities
|-
|Intrauterine growth retardation
|- IUGR without postnatal statural recovery
|-
|Idiopathic short stature
|Petite taille idiopathique, le plus souvent familiale ''(diagnostic d'élimination)''
