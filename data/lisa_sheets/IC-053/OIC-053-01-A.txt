'''Normal statural growth'''

- Takes place in the growth plates (endochondral ossification mechanism)

- Under the control of psycho-affective, nutritional and energy, hormonal, bone and genetic factors

- The 4 phases of statural growth :

o ''Foetal growth'' reflected by birth parameters: fastest growth phase (50 cm in 9 months)

o ''From birth to 4 years of age'': high growth rate which gradually decreases (25 cm in the first year of life, then around 10 cm/year for the following 2 years) with a focus on the genetic growth corridor (reflected by the target height).

o ''From age 4 to the onset of puberty'': linear growth phase (approximately 5-6 cm/year, pathological if < 4 cm/year after age 4)

o ''During puberty'': acceleration in growth rate (8-10 cm/year) with an average gain during puberty (pubertal growth peak) of 20-25 cm in girls and 25-30 cm in boys.

- Average adult height of 177 cm for men and 165 cm for women (according to French curves updated in 2018)


'''Main parameters needed to interpret the growth curve'''

- '''Birth measurements (weight and height):''' reflects foetal growth

o Expression of these parameters in standard deviations (SD) as a function of gestational age using appropriate curves

- '''Weight and height'''

o Expression of these parameters in SD as a function of age and gender using curves adapted to the population (in France, curves updated in 2018 available in the health record).

o "Normal" values (in the statistical sense of normal or Gaussian distribution) between - 2SD (2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile) and + 2SD (97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile).

o 95% of children are within ± 2 SD of the mean

- '''Target size:''' reflects genetic potential

o = (average of parental heights) + 6.5 cm if male or - 6.5 cm if female

o 95% of children are within ± 1.5 DS of their target height

- '''Statural and weight growth rate'''

o May be regular, slowed or accelerated

- Calculating the '''' body mass index (BMI):''' reflects the ratio between weight and height

o = weight (in kg) / height (in metres) <sup>2</sup>.
