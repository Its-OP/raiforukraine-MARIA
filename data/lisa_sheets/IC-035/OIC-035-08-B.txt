Ovarian causes are distinguished from central causes (hypothalamic-pituitary) and anatomical causes. Pregnancy must also be ruled out!

'''Ovarian causes:'''

*Polycystic ovary syndrome
* Premature ovarian failure (due to iatrogenic, genetic, autoimmune or idiopathic causes). Turner syndrome in particular.

'''Anatomical causes:''''

*The absence of a uterus and thus the ''[[Discovery of a malformation of the genital tract SD-105|discovery of a malformation of the genital tract]]''' is an obvious cause of primary amenorrhoea. In this case, it is important to distinguish between two main possible causes: Müllerian agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is the most famous) and a severe anomaly in biosynthesis or receptivity to androgens (androgen insensitivity syndrome with, in this case, a 46, XY karyotype).
*Hymeneal imperforation, fusion of the labia and a vaginal septum also lead to primary amenorrhoea.


'''Causes of hypothalamic-pituitary origin'''

Amenorrhoea is associated with impuberty if the pathology is present before puberty.

*Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) is diagnosed in a context of ''[[Slimming SD-017|amaigrissement]]'' ([[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]'', malnutrition, general illnesses (renal, cardiac, respiratory, tumour, absorption disorders, coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, etc.).).
*congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (with or without anosmia), often associated with more or less complete impuberty. Amenorrhoea associated with anosmia is known as Kallmann de Morsier syndrome.
*hypothalamic-pituitary tumours or lesions (adenoma, craniopharyngioma, granuloma, hypophysitis, etc.).
