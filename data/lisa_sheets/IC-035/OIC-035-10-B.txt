Secondary amenorrhoea may be preceded or followed by spaniomenorrhoea, so the causes overlap!


A distinction is made between ovarian causes, central causes (hypothalamic-pituitary) and uterine causes.

'''Ovarian causes:'''

* Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is the most frequent cause of spaniomenorrhoea with hyperandrogenism. It is also the leading cause of anovulation and infertility in women, affecting 5-10% of women of childbearing age.
* Premature ovarian failure (due to iatrogenic, genetic, autoimmune or idiopathic causes) in the process of developing.


'''Causes of hypothalamic-pituitary origin'''

* Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA) is diagnosed in the context of ''''[[Weight loss SD-017|weight loss]] ([[Eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia) SD-132|eating disorders (anorexia or bulimia)]]]'', malnutrition or general illness (renal failure, tumour, etc.). In moderate forms, it may give rise to spaniomenorrhoea.
* Hyperprolactinaemia often associated with galactorrhoea.
* Hypopthalamo-hypophyseal tumours
