Premenstrual syndromes tend to be more frequent at certain stages of a woman's genital life:

* during adolescence and particularly during the 1st cycles, which are frequently dysovulatory, which can favour a climate of relative hyperoestrogenism:
* and especially during the 1<sup>rst</sup> phase of the perimenopause during which there is a picture of "endogenous hyperstimulation" of the ovaries combining a shortening of cycles, more abundant or even haemorrhagic periods in some patients and a climate of relative and even sometimes absolute hyperoestrogenism.
* Excessive consumption of caffeine, nicotine, alcohol and fast sugars.
