'''The diagnosis is clinical.'''

'''Abscess:'''

The occurrence of a subcutaneous abscess is the consequence of an extension of a neighbouring infection with compartmentalisation. The clinical picture corresponds to that of a cellulitis with a fluctuating area at its centre: a purulent collection.

In the case of hand abscesses, infections of the deep spaces may occur:

* on the dorsal surface, subaponeurotic
* in the thenar and hypothenar eminences
* in the medio-palmar and interdigital areas

'''Panaris:'''

The affected area must be identified: finger or hand, palmar or dorsal surface, phalanx, nail, pulp or joint.

Lymphangitis, lymphadenopathy and signs of fever should be sought.

In the case of panariasis, periungual and pulpal forms are the most common.


There is no need to request additional biological or imaging tests to confirm the diagnosis.

Front and side X-rays should be ordered to document the site of entry (search for a foreign body) and rule out a bone complication (osteitis), particularly if the disease is progressing slowly and the patient is at risk.
