→ As in adults, biological tests do not help in the diagnosis of peritonitis in children, which is clinical. They provide information on the severity of the picture ("''[[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]''').

*Usually: neutrophil hyperleukocytosis and high CRP, but beware of the inertia of these biological signs.
*Neutropenia suggests sepsis with a poor prognosis.
*Blood ionogram to assess fluid and electrolyte disorders.
*Blood cultures +++

→ The unprepared abdomen should no longer be prescribed in the work-up for peritonitis.

→ Abdominal ultrasound has a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 90% to detect acute appendicitis in children, however its negativity does not exclude the diagnosis.

→ Abdominal CT is rarely indicated (unclear aetiology after initial work-up, work-up of acute pancreatitis or an abdominal wound).
