The main causes of peritonitis in children are :

- Appendicular, in the vast majority of cases.

- Perforation of hollow organs (infected Meckel's diverticulum, traumatic intestinal injury, acute intestinal intussusception, intestinal obstruction with digestive distress), sometimes.

- Primitive (pneumococcal infection) or on peritoneal dialysis catheters, rarely.
