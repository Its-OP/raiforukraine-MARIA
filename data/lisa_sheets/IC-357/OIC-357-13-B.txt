→ '''Surgical''' treatment is an '''emergency''' (exploration of the abdomen, bacteriological samples, treatment of the cause, peritoneal cleansing) ("''[[Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]]''") and must be systematically associated with an '''anti-infectious treatment'' and the management of '''organ failure'''.

→ Antibiotic treatment is usually prescribed for a '''duration of 4 days'' (in uncomplicated community peritonitis) and must systematically take into account enterobacteria and anaerobic digestive germs.

→ The antibiotic therapy recommended in community-acquired peritonitis is '''amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + gentamicin''' or '''ceftriaxone + metronidazole''' ('''[[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|prescribe an anti-infective]]'''') .

→ Antibiotic treatment of healthcare-associated peritonitis or severe forms of peritonitis may be extended to 8 to 14 days and should target bacteria resistant to the usual antibiotics as well as enterococci and yeasts depending on the patient's terrain.

→ Anti-infective treatment should be de-escalated with the results of microbiological samples (culture of peritoneal fluid, blood cultures).
