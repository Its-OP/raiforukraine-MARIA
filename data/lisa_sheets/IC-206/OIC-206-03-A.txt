There are two types of etiological investigation ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]).

#If there is a clear clinical indication, pleural puncture will be targeted at a specific aetiology.

The main examples are :

*In an emergency :

para-pneumonic effusions, where puncture is used to separate complicated and uncomplicated effusions (see above),

thoracic trauma, where puncture is used to look for a haemothorax,

pulmonary embolism, in which puncture is of little use, but the standard investigations necessary to find an embolism are carried out

*Non-emergency cases include

tumour pathology, where puncture is used to look for the presence of tumour cells.

2. When there is no clinical orientation, the etiological approach is based on biochemical, microbiological and cytological analysis of the pleural fluid.

A chest CT scan is not performed routinely. It is used to investigate the aetiology of exudates (pleural thickening or nodules, pleural calcifications).
