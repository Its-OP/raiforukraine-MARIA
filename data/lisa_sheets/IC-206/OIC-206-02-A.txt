The signs of severity are essentially clinical and therefore the classic signs of poor respiratory tolerance: polypnoea > 30/min, signs of struggle, impaired alertness, signs of shock, signs of right ventricular failure (items 359 and 332).

The signs on the chest X-ray are a deviation of the mediastinum, but these must be interpreted in the light of the clinical condition.
