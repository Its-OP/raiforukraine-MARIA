The diagnosis of pleural effusion is suspected in a patient whose clinical symptoms may include a dry cough, dyspnoea or laterothoracic pain classically accompanied by breathing when the clinical examination suggests a liquid pleural syndrome: abolition of the vesicular murmur, dullness on percussion, and abolition of vocal vibrations, most often off-axis and unilateral ([[Discovery of anomalies on pulmonary auscultation SD-020|discovery of anomalies on pulmonary auscultation]]). This diagnosis is confirmed by radiography and/or ultrasound.

Ultrasound can confirm the existence of a fluid effusion by showing an anechoic or hypoechoic image, depending on the composition of the effusion.

The chest X-ray performed in the standing position ([[Request/reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]], [[Writing the request for an imaging examination SD-230|writing the request for an imaging examination]], [Requesting an imaging examination SD-231|requesting an imaging examination]]) reveals a dense, homogeneous, non-systematised opacity, blurring the contours of neighbouring elements (in particular the diaphragmatic dome), non-retractile, limited by a concave border line above and medially (Damoiseau's line). When the fluid effusion accompanies a pneumothorax, the upper limit of the fluid effusion appears as a horizontal line (hydroaeric level).

If the effusion is small, there is simply a filling in of the costodiaphragmatic recess, visible earlier on the side view. If the effusion is very large, the chest X-ray will show a complete opacity of one hemithorax.

The differential diagnosis is essentially the interpretation of a homogeneous opacity on the chest X-ray:

*Lung atelectasis is a homogeneous systematised opacity with a deviation of the mediastinum, or even the diaphragmatic dome, towards the opacity, whereas the deviation is towards the healthy side in the case of pleurisy.
*An alveolar syndrome is a homogeneous opacity which is generally systematised, but there is an air bronchogram within the opacity.
