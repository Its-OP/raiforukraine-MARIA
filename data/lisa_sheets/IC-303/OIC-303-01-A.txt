Most stomach tumours are benign (glandular cystic polyps, hyperplastic polyps, adenomatous polyps).

There are 4 anatomopathological types of malignant tumour of the stomach.

ยง The most common is adenocarcinoma.

Stomach adenocarcinoma can be localised:

o Either in the proximal part

- Oeso-gastric junction (cardia)

- Body of the stomach (fundus),

o Or distally, under the anto-gundial angle (antrum-pylorus)

Gastric adenocarcinoma is also classified according to the presence or absence of molecular alterations with a therapeutic impact (HER2 status, MSI status, PD-L1 expression).


ยง Other rarer histologies of primary malignant gastric tumours have a more favourable prognosis:

o Endocrine tumours,

o Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) lymphomas

o Stromal tumours (GIST: Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumor)


ยง Malignant tumours of the stomach can also be metastatic gastric localisations of an extra-gastric primary, primarily breast cancer.
