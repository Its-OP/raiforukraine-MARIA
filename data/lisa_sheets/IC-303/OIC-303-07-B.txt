Adenocarcinoma :

The 5-year survival rate for operated patients (localised disease) is around 40%. In the case of metastatic disease, the median lifespan is 12 to 16 months (wide individual variations +++).


Endocrine tumours :

Gastric endocrine tumours are usually well differentiated and not very aggressive (reflected by the number of mitoses using Ki67 labelling). They usually progress slowly, with little metastasis.


Lymphoma :

There are several types of lymphoma, the most common of which is not very aggressive (MALT lymphoma). The first-line treatment is eradication of HP, which is often sufficient to cure the lymphoma. More rarely, there are aggressive forms whose evolution is that of a classic lymphoma.


Stromal tumours (GISTÂ° :

How they evolve depends on their size at diagnosis, with tumours less than 1 cm in size generally being of limited aggressiveness.
