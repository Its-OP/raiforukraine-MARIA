- Dissection of an extra- or intracranial cerebral artery is one of the most frequent causes of cerebral infarction before the age of 50.

- Hypertension ([[Hypertension SD-042|hypertension]]) is the only vascular risk factor that increases the risk of dissection.

- The clinical diagnosis is evoked by an inconstant triad associating

# a focal neurological deficit of sudden onset ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]<nowiki/>r; [[Facial paralysis SD-127|facial paralysis]]; [[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]; [[Vision abnormality SD-138|vision abnormality]]),
# headache or neck pain ([[Headache SD-118|headache]]; [[Spinal pain (cervical, dorsal or lumbar) SD-072|spinal pain]]; [[Cervicofacial pain SD-144|cervicofacial pain]]),
# paralysis of a cranial pair or Claude Bernard Horner syndrome.

- Dissection may occur spontaneously or in the context of minor trauma ([[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]]; [[Cough SD-167|cough]]) or major trauma ([[Head injury SD-172|head injury]]; [[Spinal injury SD-175|spinal injury]]).

- The diagnosis of dissection will be made by an imaging examination identifying the presence of an arterial wall haematoma or arterial stenosis ([[Discovery of a cervico-facial anomaly on medical imaging examination SD-225|discovery of a cervico-facial anomaly on medical imaging examination]]). This examination may be an echo-Doppler of the supra-aortic trunks, an angioscan of the supra-aortic trunks, an MRI of the supra-aortic trunks or a T1-spir MRI sequence ([[Identify/recognise the different imaging examinations (type/window/sequences/incidences/injection) SD-233|identify/recognise the different imaging examinations]]).
