All cerebral haemorrhage has an underlying cause. The distribution of aetiologies underlying haemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood.

Small artery disease can be both ischaemic and haemorrhagic.

Other less frequent causes (cerebral venous thrombosis, toxic intake, endocarditis, congenital haemostasis disorders, etc.) may be considered depending on the context.

15% of haemorrhagic strokes occur under anticoagulant treatment. However, anticoagulant treatment is more of a favouring factor and a poor prognosis than an aetiology.
