Stroke should be suspected when there is a sudden onset of focal neurological deficit. ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]; [[Facial paralysis SD-127|facial paralysis]]; [[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]])

The ischaemic or haemorrhagic nature of a stroke can be clinically evoked according to :

- context:

o Cerebral infarction should be suspected in the presence of a known embologenic cardiac condition (valvular disease, rhythm disorder ([[Performing and interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG) SD-185|performing and interpreting an electrocardiogram (ECG)]]) or previous manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (coronary artery disease, arteriopathy of the lower limbs).

o Intraparenchymal haemorrhage should be suspected in the presence of coagulation disorders ([[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]], [[Decreased prothrombin level (pt) SD-218|decreased prothrombin level (pt)]], [[Prescription and follow-up of anticoagulant and/or antiaggregant treatment SD-248|prescription and follow-up of anticoagulant and/or antiaggregant treatment]])

- clinical data:

o Cerebral infarction is suspected if the symptoms correspond to an arterial territory (table 1).

o Intraparenchymal haemorrhage should be considered if there are early symptoms of intracranial hypertension (ICHT) ([[Headache SD-118|headache]], [[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]], [[Coma and disturbed consciousness SD-028|coma and disturbed consciousness]]).

However, ''to date, only brain imaging can tell the difference'' ([[Request for an imaging test SD-231|request for an imaging test]]).

The clinical symptoms of TIA are as varied as those of cerebral infarction ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]], [[Facial paralysis SD-127|facial paralysis]], [[Visual abnormality SD-138|visual abnormality]]). This is an emergency situation requiring "police" questioning. The following symptoms should not suggest a TIA if they occur in isolation: vertigo ([[Vertigo and dizziness SD-064|vertigo]]), diplopia ([[Diplopia SD-143|diplopia]]), dysarthria ([[Speech and/or phonation disorders SD-134|speech and/or phonation disorders]]), swallowing disorders ([[Swallowing disorders or false swallowing SD-062|swallowing disorders or false swallowing]]), loss of balance ([[Balance disorder SD-130|balance disorder]]), isolated sensory symptoms affecting only part of a limb or a hemiface, drop-attack. On the other hand, the diagnosis of TIA becomes probable if these signs are combined.
