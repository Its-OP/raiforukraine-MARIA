=== Primary and secondary stroke prevention is based on: ===

*control of modifiable vascular risk factors ([[Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320|prevention of cardiovascular disease]])
**arterial hypertension in adults and children|arterial hypertension]] in particular ([[Drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education of a patient with hypertension SD-282|drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education of a patient with hypertension]]), [[Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications|diabetes]] ([[Drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes SD-281|drug prescription, follow-up consultation and education for a patient with type 2 diabetes or secondary diabetes]]),
**dyslipidaemia ([[Prescription of a hypolipidaemic drug SD-252|prescription of a hypolipidaemic drug]]),
**obesity ([[Prevention of overweight and obesity SD-319|prevention of overweight and obesity]]),
**sleep apnoea syndrome ([[Sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia SD-135|sleep disorders, insomnia or hypersomnia (OSA)]]; [[Snoring SD-156|snoring]])
**cessation of [[Tobacco addiction|tobacco]] ([[Tobacco risk prevention SD-314|prevention of tobacco-related risks]]) and alcohol consumption ([[Alcohol risk prevention SD-313|prevention of alcohol-related risks]]),
*pharmacological measures combined with [[Primary prevention through nutrition in adults and children|Therapeutic lifestyle changes in terms of physical activity and diet]] (sleep, physical activity, diet, etc.). The aim will be not only to prevent recurrent stroke but also to prevent systemic vascular accidents ([[Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320|prevention of cardiovascular disease]]).

In the case of cerebral infarction, secondary prevention will also be optimised by antithrombotic treatment (anticoagulant or platelet anti-aggregant) ([[Prescription and monitoring of treatment with anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant SD-248|Prescription and monitoring of treatment with anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant]]) depending on the etiological mechanism identified.

=== These therapeutic measures will require: ===

*appropriate therapeutic education ([[Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a patient with a cardiovascular antecedent SD-285|Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a patient with a cardiovascular antecedent]]),
*an assessment of the tolerability of treatments ([[Suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or treatment SD-348|suspicion of an adverse drug reaction or treatment]]), particularly at haematological level (antithrombotics [[Tendency to bleed SD-059|tendency to bleed]]) and hepatic level (statins [[Elevation of transaminases without cholestasis SD-206|elevation of transaminases without cholestasis]])
*assessment of compliance ([[Assessment of therapeutic compliance SD-354|assessment of therapeutic compliance]]).
*taking into account the patient's condition [[Adaptation of treatments to a particular condition - renal failure, hepatic failure, pregnancy, elderly person...) SD-264|(adaptation of treatments to a particular condition - renal failure, hepatic failure, pregnancy, elderly person]]...); [[Follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient SD-267|follow-up consultation for a polymorbid patient]]; [[Geriatric follow-up consultation SD-295|geriatric follow-up consultation]]. ),
*polymedication ([[Follow-up consultation for a polymedicated patient SD-266|follow-up consultation for a polymedicated patient]]).

=== Post-stroke management will include systematic assessment of post-stroke complications: ===

*motor, sensory or phasic disability (justifying physiotherapy and speech therapy) ([[Situation of disability SD-345|situation of disability]]),
*cognitive deterioration ([[Consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders SD-298|consultation and follow-up of a patient with cognitive disorders]]), which occurs in 80% of patients,
*mood and sleep disorders ([[Follow-up consultation and background treatment of a depressive patient SD-288|Follow-up consultation and background treatment of a depressive patient]]; [[Prescribe a hypnotic/anxiolytic SD-256|Prescribe a hypnotic/anxiolytic]]) which are observed in 30% of patients.

Epileptic and pain complications are rarer and warrant specific management ([[Consultation and follow-up of an epileptic patient SD-289|consultation and follow-up of an epileptic patient]]; [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]]) because of their impact on patients' quality of life.
