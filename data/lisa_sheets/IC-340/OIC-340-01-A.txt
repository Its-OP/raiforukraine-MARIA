Strokes are characterised by the sudden onset of a focal neurological deficit ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]).

- The term stroke covers all cerebrovascular pathologies of arterial or venous origin:

* arterial cerebral ischaemia (80%):
** transient: transient ischaemic attack (TIA),
** constituted: cerebral infarction;
* Cerebral or intraparenchymal haemorrhage (20%) ([[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]]);
* Cerebral venous thrombosis (rare).

- Around a quarter of cerebral haemorrhages (5% of all strokes) are subarachnoid haemorrhages, which are managed in a completely different way (neurosurgery or interventional radiology).
