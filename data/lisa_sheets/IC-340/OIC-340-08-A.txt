The positive signs of severity are :

*Impaired alertness,
*respiratory distress,
*haemodynamic instability.

These signs should be sought on physical examination by assessing :

*the patient's state of consciousness ([[Coma and disorders of consciousness SD-028|Coma and disorders of consciousness]]; [[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|Mental confusion/disorientation]]; [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SD-050|Malaise/loss of consciousness]]; [[Convulsions SD-120|Convulsions]]; [[Swallowing disorders or false swallowing SD-062|Swallowing disorder]])
*the patient's haemodynamics, looking in particular for arterial hypotension and rhythm disorders (blood pressure, pulse) ([[Bradycardia SD-159|Bradycardia]]; [[Discovery of arterial hypotension SD-043|Discovery of arterial hypotension]])
*respiratory distress ([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]])
*The NIHSS score is used in the initial phase to assess the severity of the stroke (assessment of motor deficit, speech disorders and consciousness).
