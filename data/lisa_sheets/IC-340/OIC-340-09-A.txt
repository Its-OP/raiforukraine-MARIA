|<nowiki>-Macroangiopathy</nowiki>

-Presence of "significant" stenosis if > 50% of an artery upstream of the cerebral infarction and presence of vascular risk factors
|<Microangiopathy -Small deep infarct less than 20 mm in diameter associated with lipohyalinosis. Main risk factor: hypertension</nowiki>.
|<Numerous causes divided according to their embolic risk (high and moderate or poorly determined).

-Atrial fibrillation in 50% of cases.
<br />
|<Etiology not found despite exhaustive investigation</nowiki>.

- Incomplete balance sheet

-Multiple causes
<br />
|<Dissection of the cervical arteries is one of the most frequent causes of cerebral infarction in young people (approximately 20%).

- rare causes of macro- and microangiopathies (inflammatory, haematological, metabolic, genetic, etc.) to be investigated according to the clinical and anamnestic context and complementary examinations.
