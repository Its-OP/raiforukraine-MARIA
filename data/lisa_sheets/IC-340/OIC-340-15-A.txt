Medical regulation by the SAMU-Centre 15 enables the stroke network to be activated, thereby limiting delays in diagnosis and treatment.        

Actions in the pre-hospital phase can be broken down into 3 stages:

# the alert,
# calling the SAMU-centre 15,
# transporting the patient to a hospital.

== The warning ==
<u>The first step</u> is to educate and inform the general public about the clinical signs of a stroke (sudden onset of facial deformity, speech impairment, loss of strength) ([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]]; [Appearance of difficulty walking SD-066|Appearance of difficulty walking]]; [[Facial paralysis SD-127|Facial paralysis]]) and what to do in the event of a suspected stroke (call the SAMU-centre 15). 

== The call to the SAMU-centre 15 ==
<u>The second stage</u> is medical regulation at the SAMU-centre 15 by healthcare professionals :

'''Stroke is an absolute emergency.'''

Medical regulation assistants must be able to identify the clinical signs of stroke on the call.

Role of the regulating doctor:

* confirm the stroke alert,
* determine the time of onset of symptoms,
* look for signs of seriousness (impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, haemodynamic instability),
* decide whether or not to send a medical team,
* take a history,
* current treatment (in particular anticoagulation or anti-platelet aggregation),
* search for contraindications to thrombolysis.

Triggering of the neurovascular network previously established with the various players (neurologist, emergency doctor, neuroradiologist) at the local centre.

Organisation of transport and destination in consultation with the neurologist on call.

== Transporting the patient to a hospital centre ==
<u>The third stage</u> is the '''transport of the patient''' :

Choosing the most rapidly available and appropriate transport for the patient's situation.

If signs of seriousness : send an SMUR medical team ([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|Coma and consciousness disorders]]; [[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|Mental confusion/disorientation]]; [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SD-050|Malaise/loss of consciousness]] ; [[Convulsion SD-120|Convulsion]]; [[Bradycardia SD-159|Bradycardia]]; [[Discovery of arterial hypotension SD-043|Discovery of arterial hypotension]]; [[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Acute respiratory distress]])

If there are no signs of seriousness: do not call the emergency medical services

Referral to a hospital with an emergency department with telestroke, a neurovascular unit and/or an interventional neuroradiology unit.
