The principle Compulsory reporting is a major method of ''epidemiological surveillance of infectious diseases'' which is mandatory for everyone (doctors, biologists, patients concerned). It enables the health authorities to intervene rapidly to ''protect the health of the population'' and to have up-to-date information on a health problem deemed important.

In 2021, the Minister for Health will define 36 notifiable diseases (MDO), 34 of which are infectious diseases (most of which are transmissible). This [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire/liste-des-maladies-a-declaration-obligatoire list], available on the website [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/ www.santepubliquefrance.fr], may be updated as epidemiology evolves.

'''The 3 actors are:'''

*Declarants'': biologists and doctors confronted with a suspected or confirmed MDO;
*the medical inspectors of the ''Agences Régionales de Santé'';
*epidemiologists from ''[[Know the 4 main missions of Santé Publique France in the field of infectious diseases 2C-145-DE-B05|Santé Publique France]]''.

Compulsory reporting is a two-stage process: firstly, reporting (with the exception of Pandemic Influenza outbreaks not requiring urgent public health measures) and secondly, notification (for all Pandemic Influenza outbreaks) (see Table).
