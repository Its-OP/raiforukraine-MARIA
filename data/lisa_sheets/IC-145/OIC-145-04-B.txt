'''''Prevalence''':'' ratio between the number of people affected by a disease in a population, at a given time, and the population as a whole.

For example, 150,000 people were living with HIV in France in 2015 (a country with a population of 65 million), corresponding to a prevalence of 2.3/1000 inhabitants.

'''''Incidence'':'' ratio between the number of new cases of a disease in a population, during a given period, and the total population monitored during the period.

''Example: the number of new cases of tuberculosis in 2012 in France was 4,975 per 65 million inhabitants, corresponding to an annual incidence of 7.6 new cases per 100,000 inhabitants.''

''''' "Attack rate": "ratio between the number of new cases of infection during a given period and the total number of uninfected contacts at the start of the period; in epidemic periods, it is used to characterise the transmissibility of the phenomenon over time and/or within different risk groups.

For example: whooping cough is a highly contagious disease, and in family epidemics, attack rates of 90% have been observed in non-vaccinated people.

'''''Basic reproduction number''' '''(R<sub>0</sub>; to be pronounced''''' ''''R zero').'''' R<sub>0</sub> is the expected average number of new cases of a communicable disease directly generated by a contagious person in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection (without immunity).

''Example: an R<sub>0</sub>>1 for COVID-19 indicates that the number of secondary cases is increasing. For influenza, R<sub>0</sub> ≈ 2, for measles, R<sub>0</sub> ≈ 16.''

'''''Mortality''':''' ratio between the number of deaths in a given period (generally one year) and the total population (generally reported per 100,000 people).

'''''Lethality:''''' ratio between the number of deaths in a given period and the population affected by the condition in question.

''Example: over the last 10 years, there have been 50 to 60 deaths each year linked to invasive meningococcal infections in France, for a number of cases ≈ 500/year, giving a mortality rate of 0.1/100,000 (overall population) and a case-fatality rate of 10-12% (among cases)''.
