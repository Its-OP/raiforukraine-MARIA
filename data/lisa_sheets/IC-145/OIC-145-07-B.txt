The transmission of an infectious disease results from the interaction between :

*'''''An infectious agent''''' characterised by its pathogenicity (ability to cause disease), its virulence (ability to develop and/or secrete toxins in an organism), its inoculum (infectious load introduced into the organism: number of viable bacteria, viral particles, etc.), its [[Prescription and monitoring of anti-infectives in adults and children (see item 330)|resistance to anti-infectives]], ''etc''.
*'''''A reservoir''''': the ecological location where the infectious agent usually lives and multiplies, and which may be man himself.
*'''''A vector''''': animate or inanimate carrier of the infectious agent.
*'''''A source ''''': unusual place where the infectious agent multiplies (e.g. a hot water system for Legionella pneumophila).
*'''''A host''''': an individual characterised by susceptibility (immunity, skin lesions or other entry points, etc.) or risk behaviour (risky sexual practices, injectable drug use, certain leisure activities: hunting - tularemia, fishing - leptospirosis), leading to the development of an infection or colonisation by the infectious agent.

For "strict pathogens" (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, haemorrhagic fever viruses), interaction with the host always leads to infection (rather than simple colonisation).

In other cases, the interaction between an infectious agent and a host may result in "colonisation" that is tolerated by the host. This agent may be part of the host's usual flora (commensal flora) or not (opportunistic agent). In this case, the transition from colonisation to infection results from a disruption in the balance between the infectious agent and the host due to an alteration in the host's local defences (cutaneous invasion or mucosal alteration) or general immune defences ([[Fever in an immunocompromised patient|opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients]]).

An ''infection'' is said to be ''endogenous'' when the reservoir is the microbiota (all commensal microorganisms hosted in the skin, mucous membranes and digestive tract).

An ''infection is said to be exogenous'' when the reservoir of infectious agents is located outside the infected host. The ''reservoir'' can then be :

*Human: this is the most common situation. A person infected or colonised by an infectious agent (e.g. ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', ''Neisseria meningitidis'') transmits it to other individuals.
*'''Animal''': the infectious disease is then a [[Zoonoses|zoonose]] (e.g. non-typical salmonellosis, listeriosis).
*Environmental'': the reservoir is soil (telluric germ, e.g. tetanus), air (e.g. aspergillosis) or water (aquatic germ, e.g. legionellosis).
