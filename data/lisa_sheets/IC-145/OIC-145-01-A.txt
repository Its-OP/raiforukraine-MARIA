Transmissible infectious diseases are defined by :

- The fact that they are caused by an infectious agent (bacteria, virus, parasite, fungus, prion);

- And their ability to be transmitted between individuals in the case of contagious diseases, or to several individuals from a common source.

Note: not all communicable diseases are contagious, i.e. they are not all transmitted from person to person (e.g. tetanus, botulism, legionellosis).

''''' Epidemic: a rapid increase in the incidence of a communicable disease in a given geographical area over a given period.

'''''"Pandemic": a worldwide epidemic.

'''''In the field of health, an indicator''''' is a variable that is measured and used to describe and monitor the state of health of a population. It is a tool for evaluation and decision-making (e.g. mortality, morbidity, incidence, prevalence).
