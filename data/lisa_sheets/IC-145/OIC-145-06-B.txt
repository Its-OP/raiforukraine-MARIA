Santé Publique France (SPF, [https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/ www.santepubliquefrance.fr]) is a public body under the authority of the French government which is responsible for organising health monitoring in France. Its 4 health monitoring missions are :

'''''. Ongoing monitoring and observation of the state of health of the French population '''''

*Collecting and processing data on health status for epidemiological purposes, via correspondents making up the national public health network (RNSP),
*Examples: monitoring the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in certain bacterial species (e.g. Escherichia coli and β-lactams, enterococci and glycopeptides), the incidence of notifiable diseases (e.g. invasive meningococcal infections, tuberculosis, viral hepatitis), vaccination in the population (vaccination coverage).

'''''2. Health watch and vigilance'''''

*To analyse and update knowledge of health risks, their causes and trends,
*Detect risk factors likely to modify or alter the health of the population.

'''''3. Health warning'''''

*Inform the Minister for Health of any threat to public health,
*Make recommendations to prevent or mitigate the threat.

'''''4. Contributing to the management of health crisis situations'''''

*''Ex: in the event of an alert linked to an emerging virus (e.g. SARS-CoV-2), SFP is responsible for validating the criteria defining a suspect case when a patient presents as a possible case''.

Its fields of action cover communicable infectious diseases, but also the effects of the environment on health, work-related risks, chronic diseases and trauma, as well as international health risks, whether infectious or not.

SFP has a regional network of Inter-Regional Epidemiology Units (CIRE, see above) which relay its actions and carry out some of its tasks at regional level.
