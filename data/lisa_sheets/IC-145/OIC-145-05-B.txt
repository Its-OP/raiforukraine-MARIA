'''''Sensitivity''':'' proportion of subjects classified as ill (with a positive test result) out of all subjects actually suffering from the disease.

'''''"Specificity": proportion of subjects classified as not ill (with a negative test result) out of all subjects not affected by the disease.

''''' ''Positive predictive value'':'' proportion of sick subjects among those classified as sick (with a positive test result).

''''' ''Negative predictive value'': '''proportion of non-diseased subjects among those classified as non-diseased (with a negative test result).<br />''.
