Communicable infectious disease surveillance involves the compilation and analysis of clinical and/or microbiological data relating to infectious diseases. Its aim is to describe a disease and study its risk factors, with a view to implementing and evaluating prevention and control measures. Data may be collected on an ongoing or ad hoc basis, for example from laboratory networks, hospitals or general practitioners.

Monitoring can be :

*Passive'': spontaneous reporting by field workers.
*Active'': data collection by dedicated staff who gather information that is often more exhaustive and elaborate than in the case of passive surveillance.
*Semi-active'': reminders or reminders sent to field workers, search for additional cases.

Surveillance is organised at different levels:

*'''Territorial''' with a network of various sources (for example: microbiology laboratories for the Observatoire National de l'Epidémiologie de la Résistance Bactérienne aux Antibiotiques - ONERBA; doctors for the Sentinelles network)
*'''National''': Santé Publique France (SPF), surveillance networks, National Reference Centres (CNR)
*International: World Health Organisation (WHO), European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) in Europe, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States.
