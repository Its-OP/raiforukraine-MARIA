The [[Knowing the main structures and organisations responsible for monitoring communicable infectious diseases in France 2C-145-DE-B02|r√©seau Sentinelles]] '''([https://www.sentiweb.fr/france/fr/? www.sentiweb.fr])''' is a research and monitoring network in primary care (general medicine and paediatrics) in mainland France.

'''The main objectives'' of the Sentinel Network are :

*The creation of large databases in general medicine and paediatrics, for health monitoring and research purposes;
*The development of epidemic detection and forecasting tools;
*setting up clinical and epidemiological studies.

This national computerised surveillance system enables epidemiological data to be collected weekly, analysed, forecast and redistributed in real time. The diseases monitored by the Sentinelles network are updated every year.

In 2018, the Sentinelles network was made up of 1,314 volunteer private GPs (2.1% of private GPs in mainland France) and 116 volunteer private paediatricians (4.3% of private paediatricians in mainland France), spread across mainland France. Member doctors are known as 'Sentinel doctors'.
