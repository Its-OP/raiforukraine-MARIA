- Organ-specific autoimmune diseases are characterised by symptoms associated with dysfunction of the target tissue or organ.

- These organ-specific autoimmune diseases can therefore affect organs of the endocrine system (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune adrenal insufficiency), the digestive system (autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Biermer's disease), the skin (autoimmune bullous dermatoses : pemphigus, pemphigoid and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita), central nervous system (multiple sclerosis) or peripheral nervous system (myasthenia) and kidney (Goodpasture's syndrome).

- Certain organ-specific autoimmune diseases may be associated with a non-organ-specific autoimmune disease, for example Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Gougerot-Sjögren's syndrome.

- Biologically, there are frequently autoantibodies directed against antigens specifically present in the target organ.
