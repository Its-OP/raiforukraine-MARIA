The course and prognosis vary from one AD to another and from one patient to another. Management is therefore personalised according to the context (age, co-morbidity) and the AD (type, severity at a given time).

This is a ''long-term care'' (chronic disease) which involves coordination between the people involved in the patient's care (general practitioner, other doctors and paramedical staff).

'''The therapeutic approach''' often requires:

* A request for recognition as a long-term condition
* Proposals for therapeutic education programmes
* Medication treatment, often of the anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive type
* Symptomatic treatment (pain management, etc.)
* Psychological care
* Prevention of cardiovascular and infectious risks (immunocompromised patients)
* Regular exercise and a balanced diet


Different classes of drugs may be used, sometimes in combination or alternatively, depending on the context:

* anti-inflammatory drugs ;
* glucorticoids
* chemical immunosuppressants that act on the activation and/or survival of immune cells
* biotherapies: drugs designed to target more specific activation pathways by targeting cytokines and/or their receptors involved in the pathophysiology of the AD in question


There are national recommendations (PNDS available on the HAS website) for certain ADIs, and for rare ADIs there is a national network of centres of reference and competence.
