Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) represent '''the third leading cause of morbidity in developed countries''. Their prevalence '''varies''' from one disease to another and from one geographical area to another.

Autoimmune dysthyroidism is extremely common, with a prevalence of around 1% in women, who are affected 5 to 10 times more often than men.

Rheumatoid arthritis and Gougerot-Sj√∂gren's syndrome are also common systemic diseases.

Many other IBDs have a prevalence of < 1/2000 and are therefore rare diseases.

As a general rule, autoimmune diseases ''are more prevalent in women''. In systemic lupus erythematosus, the predominance of women is very clear, with a sex ratio of 9:1.

These diseases can occur at any age, but in women they are most common during the ovarian season, with a peak between the ages of 10 and 40 for systemic lupus erythematosus. Paediatric-onset ILI is rare.
