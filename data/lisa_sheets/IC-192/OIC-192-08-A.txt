'''''Blood count abnormalities'''''

- Variable, with multiple mechanisms (inflammation, haemolysis, renal failure, etc.) depending on the context

'''''Inflammatory reaction'''''

- An inflammatory reaction is often observed in systemic autoimmune diseases, particularly during relapses, although this is not always the case.

'''''Immunoglobulin abnormalities'''''

- Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia is very often observed in diseases involving strong activation of B lymphocytes, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or Gougerot-Sjögren's syndrome.

- A monoclonal gammopathy should prompt a search for an associated lymphoproliferative syndrome.
