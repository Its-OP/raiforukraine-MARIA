'''1 Signs, symptoms and syndromes in psychiatry (row A)''''


Definitions

- Sign: observable objective element (e.g. agitation)

- Symptom: description of a subjective experience (e.g. sadness)

- Syndrome: a set of signs and symptoms forming a recognisable whole (e.g. positive syndrome, suicidal syndrome, catatonic syndrome, etc.).


The diagnostic approach in psychiatry is "clinical" and based on the analysis of 8 domains and their "evolution over time", taking into account the "context", the "history/evolution" of symptoms and their "repercussions".

- Presentation and contact: attitude and relations with others

o Appearance: appearance, personal hygiene

o Mimicry

*Hyper/hypomimia/amimia, dysmimia/paramimia (discordant)
*Echomimicry: repetition of the speaker's facial expression.

o Level of motor activity

*↑: agitation (excessive activity with inner tension), hyperactivity: (excessive activity without inner tension), hyperkinesia: (rapid, ample movements), tasykinesia (need to wander), akathisia (impatience), impulsivity, raptus
*↓: bradykinesia/akinesia, stupor, posturing, catalepsy (maintaining posture against gravity), waxy flexibility (slight resistance to mobilisation), negativism (opposition to mobilisation)
*Unadapted: mannerism, parakinesia (parasitic movements), stereotypies (repetitive undirected movements), echopraxis, perseverations, motor repetitions; tone disorders and abnormal movements: hypertonia (permanent exaggeration of muscle tone), dystonia: (prolonged involuntary contraction with distortion), dyskinesia: (irregular abnormal involuntary movements of variable amplitude), tics.

o Language and thought (discourse)

*Language ↑: logorhea, tachyphaemia (rapid flow)
*Speech ↓: alogia, bradyphaemia, mutism
*Thinking ↑: tachypsychia, flight of ideas, loosening of associations, associaitons by assonance
*Thinking ↓: bradypsychia, mono/anideism
*maladaptive thinking: discontinuous (barrage, fading), incoherent, digressive, allusive, diffluent, repetitive, idiosyncratic, etc.
*Language form: phonetic alterations (prosody = musicality), lexical alterations (echolalia, verbal stereotypies, paralogism, schizophasia), syntactic alterations (agrammatism), pragmatic alterations (communication value).
*Discourse content: delusions, anxious ideas (of self, of the outside world, ruminations, reminiscences), mood-related ideas (depressive, expansive)

o Perception

*Hallucinations [[Hallucinations SD-122]]
*Illusions
*Hypo/hyperaesthesia sensitivity disorder
*Derealisation/depersonalisation

o Attention and memory

*Warning ↑: hyperprosexia, hypervigilance
*Attention ↓: hypoprosexia [[Attention disorder SD-129]], hypovigilance
*Memory: recollection, reliving, flashbacks (with dissociation), amnesia, paramnesia, impaired working memory

o Affects

*Emotion = affective response to a stimulus

          ↑: hyperesthesia, lability

          ↓: hypo/anesthesia

fear (response to perceived threat), anger, anxiety (negative anticipation of a future event) [[Anxiety SD-116]]

maladaptive: ideo-affective discordance, inappropriate affective reaction, ambivalence

pleasure-related: craving, hyperhedonia, anhedonia, disinhibition

*Mood = emotional tone

↑: hyperthymia, hypersyntonia (increased reactivity to context), irritability

↓: depressed mood, dysphoric (painful), athymia

Labile

Athymhormia = athymia + abulia (difficulty initiating a planned action)

o Physiological functions

*Sleep
*Nutrition
*Sexuality
*Neurovegetative system: activation of the sympathetic system (palpitations, tachypnea, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, sweating, hot flushes, etc.).

o Behaviour

*Interpersonal: social withdrawal, lack of initiative, clinophilia, disinhibition, hostility/aggressiveness, oddity.
*Suicidal [[Suicide, suicidal, suicidal, suicidal 2C-353-DE-A01]] [Suicide and suicide attempts, suicidal ideation 2C-353-PE-A01
*To reduce anxiety: avoidance, compulsion

o Ability to judge, awareness of the disorder

*Diminished, altered (illogical thinking = correct premise/illogical reasoning, paralogical thinking = incorrect premise/logical reasoning)
*Insight: awareness of symptoms and signs
