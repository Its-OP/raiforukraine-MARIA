'''2.   Categorical approach in psychiatry (rank B)'''

In psychiatry, the term "disorder" is preferred to "illness" because of the complexity of the aetiology (illness refers to a lesion model).

The categorical approach classifies signs and symptoms into entities with prognostic value = diagnostic categories.

Interests of the categories: information sharing, epidemiological/therapeutic studies, access to care/financial regulation, recognition of the disorder/communication.
