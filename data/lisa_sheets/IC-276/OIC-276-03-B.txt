'''a.    Hepatomegaly''

Abdominal ultrasound should be performed as the 1st<sup>line</sup>, possibly supplemented by a CT scan or MRI of the liver.

In the event of hepatomegaly without focal lesions, primary liver disease (acute or chronic) must be suspected as a priority.

The diagnostic approach is largely dependent on the clinical context. The main distinguishing features are summarised in Table 3.


In the case of hepatomegaly with focal lesion(s), the approach is that of characterising hepatic lesions (benign, malignant or infectious tumours) (Table 4).

In this case, the diagnostic approach is based on the context and the appearance of the lesions on imaging, which enables the lesions to be characterised in the majority of cases.


'''b.    Abdominal mass

The approach is based in the 1st<sup>rst</sup> place on the location of the mass, making it possible to suspect the organ affected. The challenge is then to confirm the nature of the mass.
