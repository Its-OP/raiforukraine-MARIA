An abdominal mass is defined as an increase in volume of an intra-abdominal organ.

Hepatomegaly is usually defined as an increase in the volume of the liver. In clinical practice, hepatomegaly is defined by a palpable liver. More often than not, a palpable liver is pathological. Measuring the size of the liver is of no clinical value.
