'''a.   Indications'''

Hepatic puncture and biopsy is indicated when the clinical examination, biological tests and imaging cannot establish the cause of the hepatomegaly and/or in the event of a focal lesion not identified by imaging.

It requires patients to be informed of the procedures and risks involved, and to give their informed consent.



'''b.   Terms and conditions'''

In the absence of focal liver lesions, liver biopsy may be performed transparietally (usually under ultrasound guidance and local anaesthetic), transvenously (transjugular approach and local anaesthetic), or surgically.


The transparietal route will be contraindicated and the transvenous route will be chosen if one of the following conditions is present:

- haemostasis disorders (thrombocytopenia<60,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or prothrombin rate <50% or APTT > 1.5 times control)

- taking anticoagulants, platelet anti-aggregants or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- haemodialysis

- ascites (even minimal)


In the case of a focal lesion, liver biopsy should involve the focal lesion and the non-lesional liver parenchyma (2 samples). It should be performed transparietally, as a transvenous approach does not allow biopsy of a focal lesion, and must be guided by imaging (abdominal ultrasound or even CT scan).

In the event of a large liver abscess, the abscess is punctured +/- drained under ultrasound guidance, with bacteriological and possibly parasitological analysis depending on the context (Entamoeba histolytica PCR).



'''c.''' '''Contraindications''' :

- Dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts

- Thrombosis of the 3 suprahepatic veins prevents transjugular biopsy.

- In cases of suspected cystic echinococcosis, puncture for diagnostic purposes is contraindicated.

<br />Disorders of haemostasis and ascites are not contraindications in principle.
They do, however, require the biopsy method to be adapted (transvenous).
Similarly, if you are taking medication that alters haemostasis (anticoagulants, platelet antiaggregants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), you should either stop taking them beforehand if possible or adapt the biopsy procedure (transvenous).


'''d.''' '''Complications''' :

- abdominal pain

- bleeding (haematoma, haemoperitoneum, haemorrhagic shock)

- pleural or biliary effraction

These potential complications justify close monitoring of pulse and blood pressure for at least 6 hours after the procedure, as well as bed rest for the same length of time (transparietal route) and the jugular puncture site (transvenous route).
