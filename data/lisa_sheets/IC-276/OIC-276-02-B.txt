Hepatomegaly is not a very specific sign. The main causes are grouped according to mechanism in table 1. The most frequent causes are hepatic steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatic metastases of digestive cancers.

The main causes of abdominal masses are summarised in Table 2. Tumour is the most common cause. The causes vary according to the organ affected.
