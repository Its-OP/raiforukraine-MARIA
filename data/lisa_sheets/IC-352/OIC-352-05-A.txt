These are essentially non-psychiatric pathologies and intoxication by psychoactive substances, which must be ruled out before a diagnosis of PA can be made.

- Non-psychiatric conditions : cardiovascular (acute coronary episode, [[Adult heart failure|heart failure]], aortic dissection, [[Hypertension SD-042|hypertension]], rhythm disorders), respiratory (asthma, pulmonary embolism, pneumopathy), neurological (epilepsy, migraine, ischaemic stroke), endocrine (hypoglycaemia, pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, hypoparathyroidism). 

- Intoxication and withdrawal from psychoactive substances can trigger PA (alcohol addiction, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, thyroid hormones).
