In the presence of elevated creatinine levels ([[Increased creatinine SD-199|Increased creatinine]]), the signs that lead to the diagnosis of chronic interstitial nephropathy may be :

*data from the interview (notion of uropathy, repeated history of urinary tract infections, medication taken, etc.);
*Extra-renal signs related to the cause of the nephropathy (signs suggestive of sarcoidosis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, sickle cell disease);
*signs associated with the discovery of chronic renal insufficiency in adults and children or an abnormality such as low-flow proteinuria ([[Proteinuria SD-212|proteinuria]]), microscopic haematuria, leucocyturia ([[Urinary sediment analysis SD-196|urinary sediment analysis]]);
*frequent polyuria ([[Polyuropolydipsic syndrome SD-061|polyuropolydipsic syndrome]]) with nocturia ;
*the occurrence of papillary necrosis with isolated macroscopic haematuria (or associated with symptoms of renal colic) ([[Haematuria SD-102|haematuria]])
*the absence of hypertension or the appearance of hypertension later and less severe than in other chronic kidney diseases (stages 4 and 5).
