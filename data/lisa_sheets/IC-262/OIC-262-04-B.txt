The main causes of urological chronic interstitial nephropathy are :

*Obstructive or malformative pathologies;
*Vesico-ureteral reflux (sometimes complicated by glomerular lesions of segmental and focal hyalinosis);
*Lithiasis;
*Urinary tract infection plays an important role in the development of chronic interstitial nephropathy of urological origin.


The main causes of drug-induced chronic interstitial nephropathy are :

*Analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, long-term aspirin;
*Lithium;
*Antineoplastics (cisplatin++);
*Calcineurin inhibitors.


The main causes of chronic metabolic interstitial nephropathy are :

*Nephrocalcinosis (chronic hypercalcaemia);
*Chronic hypokalaemia;
*Hyperuricaemia.


Other, rarer causes include :

*Toxic causes:
**Lead ;
**Cadmium ;
**Radiation;
**Chinese grass/endemic nephropathy in the Balkans.

*Genetic causes :
**Genetic diseases with or without cysts (uromodulin mutations...).
*Dysimmune causes:
**Sj√∂gren's syndrome;
**Sarcoidosis;
**NITU syndrome (Interstitial Tubular Nephropathy with Uveitis);
**Disease associated with hyper-IgG4.
*Haematological causes:
**Monoclonal immunoglobulin, with or without myeloma;
**Sickle cell disease.
*Infectious causes:
**Tuberculosis;
**Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.
