|Order=25}}For organ donation between living donors, the specific principles are as follows:

* Respect the consent procedure set out below;
* Harvesting authorised only if there is a therapeutic interest for the recipient;
* No organs may be removed from protected adults (guardianship, trusteeship) or living minors (bone marrow and haematopoietic cells from bone marrow only).

Who can be a living donor? Historically, a living donor had to be the father or mother of the recipient, if possible. However, since 2004, donors may include spouses, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, grandparents, uncles and aunts, first cousins, as well as the spouse of the father or mother (blended couples). The donor may also be anyone who can prove that they have lived with the recipient for at least two years. It goes without saying that compatibility between donors and recipients must be reliable. In this way, the law keeps pace with changes in society and in medical and social demand.

The law also provides for the possibility of cross-donation. Cross organ donation involving living donors can take place in a "chain" between individuals.  In this way, a patient A can bring a donor B (who is not compatible with A); but this donor B will be used by a patient C who will bring a donor D who will be compatible with patient A.

In other words, we favour a donation chain between living donors and recipients.

There is therefore a requirement for considerable coordination and simultaneity between the removal and transplant operations, which means that 4 operating theatres have to be mobilised at the same time for 4 people, for example.

The law now allows the chain to be extended beyond two 'pairs'.

Consent from living donors must be explicit, free and informed. It is based on a highly codified procedure:

* Information on risks from the doctor: complete, including information on rare and exceptional risks;
* Reflection period;
* Opinion of an independent committee of experts, with the subject again being informed by this committee of experts and the freedom to consent assessed;
* Consent formulated and subsequently recorded before a magistrate (President of the Judicial Court) + intervention of the guardianship judge for protected adults (for whom only marrow donation is authorised).

It should be noted, however, that donation is prohibited in the case of living donors who are minors or under guardianship or curatorship, with the exception of marrow. In this case, the consent of the parents (holders of parental authority) or legal representative is required, as described above.
