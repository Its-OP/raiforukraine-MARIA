|Ordre=22}}In France, legislation on the protection of persons undergoing biomedical research was introduced in 1988 with the Huriet-Sérusclat law.

==Prior to 1988
Research was conducted in semi-clandestine conditions, with a low level of control, non-comparative trials and no written protocol. Trials on non-patients were illegal. Approvals were granted on the basis of expert opinion. From 1975 onwards, demands for scientific proof and rigorous methodologies began to emerge.

==Loi Huriet-Sérusclat (20 December 1988)==
This law sets out the principle of equality for all participants, whether sick or not. The terms "protection of individuals" are preferred to "human experimentation". It establishes two types of research: with direct individual benefit and without direct individual benefit. Constraints are heavier for the second type: it is necessary to obtain authorisation from the research sites, and the promoter may be held liable, even without fault.

Consent must be "free, informed and express", in accordance with international texts. Special protection is sought for "vulnerable" persons. In keeping with the principle that the human body should be free of charge, the "non-commercialisation" of the human body is affirmed. No remuneration is possible, but "compensation" for participants "without direct individual benefit" who are not hospitalised is possible.

The law provides for the creation of Consultative Committees for the Protection of Individuals in Biomedical Research (CCPPRB), independent of the administrative authority. Research will not be possible if it is not based on the latest state of knowledge, if it is not preceded by sufficient pre-clinical experimentation, if there is a foreseeable risk out of all proportion to the expected benefit, if it does not aim to extend scientific knowledge of human beings and the means likely to improve their condition, if it is not designed to reduce pain, fear or discomfort. All these conditions are cumulative.

It can only be carried out under the direction and supervision of an experienced doctor. The material and technical conditions must be appropriate to the trial and compatible with the requirements of scientific rigour and personal safety. The interests of the patient must always take precedence over the sole interests of science and society.

This law is beneficial in that it provides legal certainty for investigators and requires prior examination of protocols and informed consent. However, a number of difficulties remain: it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a study has direct benefit or not, and the protection afforded to patients is worse than that afforded to healthy volunteers.

==Law of 9 August 2004
This law transposes the 2001 European directive on clinical trials. It defines biomedical research: "Biomedical research is research organised and carried out on human beings with a view to developing biological or medical knowledge". Research occurs when, over and above the act of providing care and the immediate interests of the patient, the doctor seeks to advance scientific knowledge, i.e. to identify and formalise general teaching. This applies not only to the testing of techniques and products, but also to cognitive research.

The notions of direct or indirect benefit have been abandoned in favour of the notion of interventional and non-interventional trials. Non-interventional trials are excluded from the reform (observational survey, epidemiology). Research into routine care is subject to simplified procedures. Protocols are assessed on the basis of the benefit/risk balance rather than the therapeutic benefit. Protection is strengthened and the different protection regimes disappear.

The roles of the various players are well defined. The promoter is the natural or legal person who initiates the research, manages it and verifies its funding. The investigator is the natural person who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a given site. Where there are several investigators, a coordinator is appointed.

The Committees for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) replace the CCPPRB. The CPP is made up of fourteen members in two colleges. The medical college comprises four people qualified in research, including at least two doctors and one epidemiologist or biostatistician, one general practitioner, one hospital pharmacist and one nurse. The societal college is made up of a person qualified in ethics, a psychologist, a social worker, two persons qualified in legal matters and two representatives of associations (article R.1123-4 of the Public Health Code).

The opinion of the CPP becomes necessary and favourable. It is decision-making and no longer advisory. This opinion takes into account the information provided to the subject (time for reflection, adequacy, completeness and intelligibility of written information, oral information supported by a written text), the title of the protocol, the contact details of the sponsor and coordinating investigator, the objective, methodology and duration of the research, the expected benefits, the constraints and foreseeable risks, medical alternatives, care arrangements at the end of the research, access to results at the end of the research, confidentiality of data, the date of the opinion of the CPP and the authorisation of the competent authority and the insurance certificate issued by the sponsor. This opinion also takes account of the written consent obtained by the investigator, which must be free and informed. There are special cases: in the case of minors, consent is obtained from the legal representative; in the case of persons unable to express themselves, it is obtained from the trusted support person or the guardianship judge; in an emergency, it is obtained from the family or the trusted support person if they are present. The CPP's opinion is also based on the relevance of the research (scientific, methodological and ethical), the match between the objectives and the resources deployed, the satisfactory nature of the assessment of the expected benefits and risks and the soundness of the conclusions, the procedures for recruiting participants, the amount and procedures for compensating participants, registration on the National Volunteer Register (Internet) to prevent abuse, compliance with an exclusion period between two research studies, the quality of the research sites and the qualifications of the investigators.

The French Agency for the Safety of Health Products (AFSSAPS) has become the National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM). For products other than medicinal products, the competent authority is the Direction Générale de la Santé (DGS). The declaration system is replaced by an authorisation system. Authorisation is valid for one year. The ANSM may request additional information or suspend research.

Subjects taking part in the research must undergo a prior medical examination, be affiliated to a social security scheme, be registered in the national database, and have access to the overall results and information relating to their state of health. They may receive compensation, subject to a ceiling, for the constraints they have undergone or for the damage they have suffered (by the sponsor in the event of negligence or by a compensation fund in the absence of negligence). They may not take part in more than one research project at the same time.

Patient associations and health system users are represented on the CPPs. Overall research results must be communicated. They may be included in national and European research databases (unless the sponsor objects).

==Law of 5 March 2012 (Jardé Law)==
In the law of 5 March 2012, also known as the "law on research involving the human person" (RIPH), the term "biomedical research" has been removed. It aims to provide a single framework for medical research and simplify the procedures involved. It distinguishes between three types of research: interventional research with risk, interventional research with negligible risk (aimed at evaluating routine care) and non-interventional or observational research.

Types of research defined by the law on research involving the human person :

===1st category: interventional research involving an intervention on a person that is not justified by his or her usual care===
In risky interventional research, the intervention on the individual is not justified by his or her usual care (use of a new molecule, for example). Consent must be free, informed and express, and given in writing.

This research focuses on :

*on medicinal products;
*other health products (mentioned in article L.5311-1 of the French Public Health Code);
*foodstuffs.

Terms and conditions:

*authorisation from the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam for research involving medicinal products;
*favourable opinion from the CPP (Committee for the Protection of Individuals);
*specific insurance cover taken out by the sponsor;
*formalities with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL; for example, commitment to comply with the MR001 reference methodology);
*EudraCT number (used to identify each study carried out in the European Union; the sponsor must request this number from the European Medicines Agency).

===2nd category: interventional research involving only minimal risks and constraints===
Negligible-risk interventional research does not involve medicinal products and presents minimal risks and constraints. Consent must be free, informed and express, and may be obtained orally.

Terms and conditions:

*favourable opinion from a CPP ;
*no authorisation from the Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament (ANSM), but information (summary and opinion of the CPP sent);
*insurance taken out by the sponsor;
*CNIL procedures;
*research registration number (the sponsor must request this from the Agence nationale de sécurité du médicament);
*be part of the list established by the Order of 12 April 2018.

Research in the second category involves healthy or sick people. The minimal nature of the risks and constraints associated with carrying out the procedure(s) is assessed in the light of :

*gender
*age
*physical condition
*the pathology, if any, of the person undergoing the research;
*frequency and duration.

Such research may involve the use of health products, but these are then used under the usual conditions of use. It may involve minimally invasive procedures (venous blood sampling, non-invasive imaging, etc.).

===3rd category: non-interventional research===
Non-interventional research involves no risks or constraints. All procedures are carried out and all products are used in the usual way.

The subject must be informed and his or her non-opposition must be sought.

Terms and conditions:

*favourable opinion from a CPP ;
*no authorisation from the ANSM but information (summary and CPP opinion sent);
*application to the CNIL.


The CPP is involved in all types of research, and its opinion must be favourable for all three types.

The territorial jurisdiction of the CPPs has been abolished, and the CPPs come under the supervision of a National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person, which is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and assessing the practices of the CPPs.  The CPP will make its decision within forty-five days. If the CPP remains silent after this period, the application is rejected.

Research involving retrospective data (e.g. theses on medical files) is excluded from this framework as it does not concern individuals but data. Such research is subject solely to the opinion of the CNIL, which is based on a prior opinion from the Comité d'expertise pour les recherches, les études et les évaluations dans le domaine de la santé (CEREES).

The different players

*The French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM):
**is responsible for the methodology of first category trials (after implementation of the BR),
**issues a registration number for the first, second and third categories of research. Please note: the EUDRACT number for interventional research involving a medicinal product is provided by the European Medicines Agency, the ID-RCB number is provided by the ANSM for all other research,
**receives the summary and the opinion of the CPP for second and third category research.

*The National Commission for Research Involving the Human Person (CNRIPH), created in 2018, is responsible for coordinating, harmonising and evaluating the practices of the CPPs.
*The Committee for the Protection of Individuals (CPP) is made up of fourteen full members divided into two colleges.
*The promoter is the natural person or legal entity responsible for research involving human subjects, who manages the project and ensures that it is financed. The sponsor or its legal representative must be established in the European Union. The sponsor is usually a pharmaceutical laboratory, a research centre or a health establishment such as a university hospital.
*The investigator is the natural person(s) who directs and supervises the conduct of the research on a site. This is most often a doctor.

==Ethical issues==
Despite the strict normative framework for research, unpredictable situations, harmful effects and unethical drifts can still be observed.

The principle of protecting vulnerable populations can have a paradoxical effect by excluding these populations from clinical trials, and therefore denying them access to new therapies. In this case, equity in access to care is not respected.

In some studies, the adverse effect, which had not been observed in animals, causes significant damage in human subjects because it is specific to humans. This unpredictable adverse effect occurs even though the research has been properly conducted following a test in animals.

How can we be sure that informed consent is genuine when the subject is illiterate or does not understand the language, when the subject is a child or when the subject is incapable of giving consent? What is the value of the consent obtained? There can be no remuneration, but expenses may be reimbursed. Is there any form of control in this case? When the products studied are marketed, will their cost guarantee fair access for all? What will be the accessibility of the product for subjects who wanted to or had to withdraw from the study?

Many questions remain, despite all the attention paid to subjects suitable for biomedical research.


Key points

*Research involving human subjects is subject to strict legal supervision. This framework is essential to enable research to develop while respecting individuals.
*Since 2012, there has been a single legislative framework for all research involving humans. Research is classified into three types depending on whether or not it is interventional and on the risk involved.
*The roles of the players involved in a research protocol are well defined (investigator, sponsor).
*The personal protection committees play an important role and provide a decision-making opinion.
*The competent authority is the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines.
