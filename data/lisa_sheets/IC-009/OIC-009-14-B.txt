The law states that voluntary termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons can take place without any time limit, i.e. at any time during the pregnancy:

* either if continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health ;
* if there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis.

These two points of the law refer to two very distinct frameworks:

* on the one hand, a situation in which the woman has a medical condition that is incompatible with pregnancy and that jeopardises her health (e.g. cancer, infection, severe hypertension, psychiatric condition, etc., although the law does not set out these medical conditions or draw up a list, which is impossible to foresee);
* a condition affecting the child, resulting from the monitoring of the pregnancy and prenatal diagnosis, opening the debate on whether or not to continue the pregnancy. The law does not specify what is covered by the terms "particularly serious condition recognised as incurable" and does not draw up a list, which again is impossible to predict.

Acceptance of the woman's request is conditional on the opinion (validation) of the request by a multidisciplinary collegiate procedure. In practice, this procedure is carried out within a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre (CPDPN).

When an abortion is considered on the grounds that continuing the pregnancy would seriously endanger the woman's health, the multidisciplinary team is made up of at least four people:

* a doctor qualified in gynaecology-obstetrics, member of a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis centre;
* a practitioner specialising in the condition from which the woman suffers;
* a doctor chosen by the woman;
* a qualified person who may be a social worker or psychologist.

The doctor qualified in obstetrics and gynaecology and the doctor qualified in the treatment of the woman's condition must work in a health establishment.

The law also specifies that when termination of pregnancy is envisaged on the grounds that there is a strong probability that the unborn child will suffer from a particularly serious condition recognised as incurable at the time of diagnosis, the multidisciplinary team responsible for examining the woman's request is that of a CPDPN. When the team from the aforementioned centre meets, a doctor chosen by the woman may, at her request, be involved in the consultation. Unless it is a medical emergency, the woman is offered a period of reflection of at least one week before deciding whether to terminate or continue her pregnancy.

At the end of the meeting, two doctors who are members of the multidisciplinary team certify that the multidisciplinary opinion has been given and that the request complies with the law. In both cases, prior to the meeting of the competent multidisciplinary team, the woman concerned or the couple is informed and may, at her request, be heard by all or some of the members of the said team.

Three differences between IVG and IMG :

* Termination of pregnancy for medical reasons can only be carried out by a doctor;
* There is no time limit for termination of pregnancy: it can take place at any time during the pregnancy;
* The principles for obtaining the woman's request and consent are the same as for abortion, but the CPDPN is responsible for accepting the request for an abortion, following a rigorous procedure.
