These complications are numerous and require preventive measures.

===A- General complications===
General complications are the most serious and occur especially in cases of lower limb deficits:

- '''Thromboembolic complications''' in a patient confined to bed ''([[Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SD-276|management of a patient in prolonged decubitus]])''. Measures to prevent thrombophlebitis of the lower limbs must be implemented very quickly: anticoagulation in preventive doses, mobilisation and mechanical stimulation of venous return; any shortness of breath, low thoracic pain or malaise should raise fears of pulmonary embolism in these patients at risk.

- ''Bronchopulmonary complications'' from congestion, encouraged by bed rest and sometimes false routes.

- Falls'' when walking is resumed or when the deficit worsens, due to motor deficit or severe proprioceptive impairment, with a risk of fracture or cranial trauma.

===B- Locoregional complications===
Locoregional complications are also frequent:

- Pressure sores (heels, sacrum), prevented by regular changes to bed positioning (alternating lateral decubitus), skin massages several times a day, mobilisation of the paralysed limb and offloading equipment (cushions of various shapes, water mattresses).

- Stiffening'' of a deficient limb with the risk of retraction (due to pyramidal hypertonia, in particular) and osteoarticular complications: periarthritis, particularly scapulohumeral, para-articular osteoma, particularly in the elbow and knee. Spasticity is treated with physiotherapy, mobilisation and sometimes injections of botulinum toxin.

- Algoneurodystrophy of the upper limb, prevented by gentle, painless physiotherapy. Once the complication has appeared, treatment involves resting and cooling the limb.

- Trauma to a limb with a sensory deficit: burns not felt in the hand, trophic disorders in the foot (mal perforant).

Treatment is essentially preventive (early mobilisation, prevention of a vicious attitude [equinus foot]), and sometimes curative (intervention on retracted tendons).
