A limb motility disorder can sometimes be of multifactorial origin, particularly in an elderly subject.

Rheumatological disorders in the elderly (osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tears, etc.) are particularly common ([Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]).

Similarly, the frequency of central disorders (stroke and stroke sequelae, vascular leukopathy, degenerative disorders) increases rapidly with age.

Finally, the frequency of peripheral nerve damage also increases exponentially with age, particularly in the form of predominantly sensory polyneuropathy with a length-dependent distribution.

The analysis of a motor and/or sensory deficit in an elderly subject may therefore be disrupted by the concomitant presence of central and peripheral neurological causes, as well as rheumatological disorders.

A history of S1 sciatica may abolish the Achilles reflex on the side of the lesion, despite central damage to this limb due to a stroke.

Sometimes rheumatological lesions are secondary to neurological damage, for example scapulohumeral periarthritis on hemiparesis.
