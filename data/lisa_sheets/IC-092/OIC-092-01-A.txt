The diagnostic approach to a motor and/or sensory neurological deficit ''([[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]])'' involves several steps, sometimes intertwined during the history and clinical examination. The first part consists of identifying the location of the abnormalities. This is based on a ''syndromic analysis'' of the deficit, followed by an ''analysis of the distribution of motor and sensory abnormalities''. The kinetics of the development of the deficit will then be determined.

===B- Analysis of the distribution of motor and sensory abnormalities===
With the help of the motor syndrome analysis, it is often possible to determine the precise location of the damage by means of the distribution of the deficits.

''At the end of this analysis, it is most often possible to localise the disease. This stage is essential in the diagnostic process. The second stage consists of analysing the circumstances of the condition in order to arrive at a diagnosis, or at least to limit the aetiologies.''

===C- Circumstances of onset===
- Type of onset: sudden (''acute''); within a few days or weeks (''subacute''); insidiously over several months or years (''chronic'').

- Progression: stable; slow or rapid; relapsing; improving

- The patient's background: age and sex; personal and family history; extra-neurological signs and symptoms (AEG, skin or joint lesions, etc.).

A sudden attack (within a few minutes or a few hours) essentially points to a ''vascular origin'' (apart from trauma)''.

''A rapid worsening (in a few days or a few weeks) points first and foremost to an inflammatory, infectious or tumoral origin''.

''Slow worsening (over several months or years) points to a degenerative origin, sometimes hereditary''.
