==B.    Diagnosis of localised oedema==
Questioning and clinical examination look for signs pointing to :

*An increase in venous pressure:
**thrombophlebitis and its after-effects;
**Venous insufficiency (varicose disease).
*Certain medications: mainly calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridine.
*A lymphatic obstacle:
**cancer (pelvic or breast) with lymph node invasion;
**filariasis.
*Local inflammatory pathology:
**skin infection such as erysipelas;
**algodystrophy;
**insect bite, trauma, allergy, etc.
