A. General mechanisms of oedema formation

1.      Alteration of capillary haemodynamics (figure 1) linked to

*Increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure (Starling force);
*Decrease in plasma oncotic pressure;
*Increase in capillary permeability.


2.      Mechanisms of sodium and water retention

The amount of sodium, not its concentration, determines the extracellular volume. The body's sodium capital is regulated by the kidneys.

*Two main types of phenomenon may be responsible for oedema formation:
*true hypervolaemia: primary sodium retention by the kidney during renal failure;
*relative or "effective" hypovolaemia: right or global cardiac insufficiency, oedema-ascitic decompensation of cirrhosis, hypoalbuminaemia, particularly in nephrotic syndrome.


'''B.    Specific mechanisms of oedema formation''''

1.      Renal insufficiency

During acute or severe chronic renal failure, the sodium balance becomes positive''',''''

2.      Nephrotic syndrome and glomerular nephropathy

*In the filling deficit theory, the fall in oncotic pressure is the cause of hypovolaemia and activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system.
*In the overfilling theory, a primary excess of distal sodium reabsorption is responsible for the positive sodium balance.

3.      Heart failure

*Effective hypovolaemia secondary to the reduction in cardiac output, and therefore renal blood flow, stimulates the antinatriuretic systems (renin angiotensin aldosterone system, etc.) responsible for sodium and water reabsorption.

4.      Cirrhosis of the liver

*Effective hypovolaemia results from sequestration of blood in the splanchnic territory upstream of the liver and a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and systemic arterial pressure, leading to activation of the water and sodium reabsorption systems.
