Oedema is defined as the visible or palpable accumulation of fluid in the interstitial tissue.

A distinction must be made between :

* oedema caused locally by inflammation, venous or lymphatic insufficiency;
* generalised oedema resulting from a positive sodium and water balance (extracellular hyperhydration). In the most severe forms, this is known as hydrops.
