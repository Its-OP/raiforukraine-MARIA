The cerebral histopathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease are characterised by the presence of :

- '''Amyloid plaques''' (extracellular lesions composed of deposits of amyloid AÎ² peptides resulting from abnormal cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein or APP)

- '''Neurofibrillary degeneration''' (intracellular lesions composed essentially of hyperphosphorylated tau (tubulin associated unit) protein; this hyperphosphorylation disrupts the functioning of microtubules and therefore intra-neuronal transport)

- Activation of "neuroinflammation" (astrogliosis and microgliosis)

- And finally a ''neuronal loss''.

In people aged over 75, lesions from different pathologies frequently co-exist (e.g. lesions characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and diffuse or lacunar ischaemic vascular lesions, microhaemorrhages).
