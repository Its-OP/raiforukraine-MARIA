'''1- Adapting aids to the patient's functional independence'' (meal delivery, home help, nurse, etc.)

'''2- Protect the patient''': Medical monitoring must provide an opportunity to examine :

* environmental risks (to limit accidents in the home: gas, etc.)
* the patient's ability to manage medication properly (IDE? pillbox?...)
* driving
* the patient's ability to manage administrative and financial affairs
* the patient's relationship with their family and friends (exhaustion of carers?)
* the physical and psychological health of the carer

You also need to know how to present "legal protection measures".

* A case manager when care at home is difficult because of behavioural problems, refusal of care, severe dependency and/or isolation. This professional assesses the patient's medical and social situation, then provides advice and/or guidance depending on the patient's needs.

3- Care for carers

* therapeutic education (to better understand the disease, adapt to its symptoms and make better use of professional help)
* information provided by local information and coordination centres (CLICs) on the help available locally, as well as by local coordination support systems;
* support from family associations: carers can find solidarity, information and often discussion groups;
* respite care: this consists of giving the carer periods of free time without having to look after the patient (home carer, day care, temporary stay in a nursing home, respite platform to help access these facilities).

4- ''Non-drug therapies'': memory stimulation groups, art therapy workshops (painting, modelling, music therapy, aromatherapy), multisensory stimulation, occupational activities, physical stimulation and rehabilitation activities. These activities are adapted to the stage of neurocognitive disorders and are usually carried out in groups.
