The main purpose of ''biological tests'' is to look for factors that could aggravate cognitive disorders. They are also guided by associated comorbidities.

First intention

- Blood count (anaemia?)

- CRP

- TSH

- Blood ionogram with blood calcium, fasting blood sugar

- Albumin levels

Depending on the context

- SGOT/SGPT, Î³GT

- TPHA-VDRL, HIV serology

- Vitamins B12, B9


When neurocognitive problems develop rapidly or the clinical picture is atypical, a lumbar puncture may be performed (biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, anti-neuronal antibodies, 14 3 3 protein, microbiology or virology depending on the context, etc.).
