Vascular encephalopathy is the second most common cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly after Alzheimer's disease.

Clinical signs depend on the location and extent of the cerebrovascular lesions. Cerebral lesions may be of ischaemic or haemorrhagic origin and may induce mild cognitive impairment (minor TNC) or a dementia syndrome (major TNC).

There are several types of lesions that can cause cognitive problems:

- multiple infarctions

- multi-lacunar infarctions

- diffuse leukoencephalopathy

- strategic infarction (e.g. thalamus or angular gyrus)

- hypoperfusion

. amyloid angiopathy ...  

The sudden onset of cognitive impairment, or the classic "stair-step", is suggestive but not necessary. In diffuse encephalopathy, particularly lacunar encephalopathy, a progressive onset is observed.

On clinical examination, there may be focal neurological sequelae (pyramidal syndrome, motor deficit, homonymous lateral hemianopia, etc.) and extra-pyramidal rigidity (if there is vascular damage to the basal ganglia). Cognitive disorders are heterogeneous (dysexecutive, psychomotor slowing, etc.).
