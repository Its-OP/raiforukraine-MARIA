The brain lesions of Alzheimer's disease are characterised by the presence of :

- Amyloid plaques (extracellular lesions composed of deposits of amyloid AÎ² peptides resulting from abnormal cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein or APP)

- Neurofibrillary degeneration (intracellular lesions composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (tubulin associated unit) protein; this hyperphosphorylation disrupts the functioning of microtubules and therefore intra-neuronal transport).

- Activation of neuroinflammation

- And ultimately neuronal loss.

In people aged over 75, lesions from different pathologies frequently co-exist (e.g. lesions characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and diffuse or lacunar ischaemic vascular lesions, microhaemorrhages).
