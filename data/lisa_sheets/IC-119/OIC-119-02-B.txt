- '''Terminologies:'''

o Notion of "care" (taking care of the person) and "cure" (treating the disease), which are in fact the two constituent and inseparable aspects of medicine.

o '''''Empowerment''''' = the process of learning to live with illness and developing the ability to take care of oneself and one's health, with a view to regaining power over the illness and one's life.


- '''Adapting to chronic illness:''''

o '''Chronic illness and identity:''' identity changes affecting all feelings, values and representations = ''biographical rupture'' (''Bury'').  Changes in identity depend on social integration and interaction, and in particular care relationships (psychologisation). The patient's identity must not be reduced to the patient's identity (stigmatisation).  

o '''Chronic illness and temporality''': changes in the temporality of the chronically ill as a result of disruptions, rhythms of care, permanent reorganisation of life rhythms and apprehension about the future.



A precarious standard, dependent on the stability of conditions.

Life is considered to be satisfying or painful according to what the individual experiences and judges to be worthwhile, and not by comparison with a collective model.

The normal/pathological distinction varies according to the individual, their relationship to their environment and the time of their life.


- '''Adapting care:'''

o '''The challenge of care = Individuality and inclusion:'''

- make chronic illness part, not all, of life and of personal and social identity.

- To restore our place in ourselves and in the midst of others, to execute the opposite movement to that of suffering" ("Marin").

o '''Adapting to temporality:'''' Care must meet the needs associated with temporal experiences: remembering the patient's history to avoid repeating it; being available and attentive to the present, at the point where the patient is in their personal and medical history; demonstrating a long-term commitment with a view to organising and guaranteeing continuity of care.

o '''Adaptation to the patient's "norm"'''' Autonomy = between individual norm (as appropriated by the sick person) and social prescription (as conceived by society and medicine): requires constant adjustment of the goals to be pursued and the means to be used in order to adapt continuously to the unpredictability of the disease and the treatments themselves = an ongoing decision-making process ("shared tinkering" according to Mol).
