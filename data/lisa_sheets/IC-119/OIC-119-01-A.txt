'''a.    Be familiar with the main population survey data on living with a chronic illness and/or disability''''

'''Chronic illness:'''

- '''Definitions''' :

o According to the World Health Organisation (WHO): ''long-term condition (lasting 6 months or more)''.

o According to the French Haut Conseil de la Santé Publique: a pathological condition of a physical, psychological and/or cognitive nature that is likely to persist and have a major impact on the patient's daily life.

- '''Epidemiology:''' concerns 20 million patients in France, i.e. almost 1/3 of the population.

- '''Consequences:''' serious medical complications, disability, physical and mental suffering, impairment of quality of life.

Disability:

- '''Definition''': see Item 118.

Epidemiology: 12 million people in France in 2020. In 80% of cases, the disability is "invisible". There are usually 6 categories of disability: motor, visual, hearing, psychological, intellectual impairment and disabling illnesses.  

'''b.     To be familiar with the main survey data concerning the resources, practices, experiential knowledge, know-how, etc. of people living with a chronic illness or disability and their carers''''

'''Illness as work and a negotiated social construction''' :

- The chronically ill patient = a social player; a fully-fledged player in medical work (''Strauss''), in interaction with healthcare professionals and in the day-to-day management of their care = co-production work.

- Chronic illness = a "negotiated social construction" in which the patient is the main actor ("Baszanger"). It causes multiple disorganisations and ruptures in the patient's personal and social life. It requires patients to work constantly to ensure the continuity of their social life, while integrating the changes brought about by the illness.

- Notion of the "work of controlling illness" ("Strauss"): control of emotions in medical and social interactions; work of maintaining social relationships; control of information in the private and public spheres so as to gain recognition for the status of patient without being stigmatised.

- Life with a chronic illness = "practical task", a myriad of daily micro-decisions and micro-activities of a very diverse nature ("Mol").

- Caring for a chronically ill patient: must be based on the patient's activity, experiential knowledge (knowledge of daily life with the disease, knowledge of care pathways and patient-doctor relationships) and human resources, in particular medical and non-medical care networks (family, carers, friends, patient associations, peer or expert patient groups).
