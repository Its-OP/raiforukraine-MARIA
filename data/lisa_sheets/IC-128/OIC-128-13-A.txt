Clinical manifestations are independent of aetiology.

-Spontaneous pain of insidious onset, mechanical rhythm, initial pelvicrural topography with progressive worsening (increase in intensity, tendency to permanence and topographical extension to the thorax, scapula, spine and limbs).

These pains are the result of :

- fractures or cracks clearly visible on X-rays (Looser-Milkman striae) but also linked to myopathy (see below)

- proximal myopathy in half the cases, with "muscle weakness" and no neurological deficits.

In cases of osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency, "biological arguments" are of great diagnostic value and are characterised by :

- a decrease in ''calcaemia'' and phosphataemia;

- hypocalciuria;

- an increase in alkaline phosphatases;

- a drop in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (reserve form), usually < 5 ng/mL;

- hyperparathyroidism secondary to hyperocalcaemia''''''hypocalcaemia''.
