A '''bone densitometry''' is required for '''osteoporosis screening''', i.e. :

- when an osteoporotic fracture occurs (or is discovered on X-rays),

- if one or more osteoporosis risk factors are identified during questioning,

Among the indications for bone densitometry recognised and reimbursed by the health insurance scheme :

- regardless of age or sex:

o a history of fracture without major trauma

o in the case of pathology or treatment potentially inducing osteoporosis (for example, primary hyperparathyroidism, untreated progressive hyperthyroidism or corticosteroid therapy lasting more than three months)

- in addition to a non-traumatic fracture, in post-menopausal women :

o history of non-traumatic hip fracture in a relative in the 1st<sup>degree,

o a BMI < 19 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,

o early menopause (before the age of forty)

o a history of corticosteroid use ≥ 3 consecutive months at a dose ≥ 7.5 mg/kg prednisone equivalent.


'''Radiographies rachidiennes'''

Indications:

- In practice, morphological assessment of the spine (usually using X-rays) is indicated if there is ''pain in the lumbar region'', ''pain in the spine,''

- and/or a loss of height ≥ 4 cm. A '''[[Spinal deformity SD-065|spinal deformity]]''' kyphosis is possible in the case of vertebral fracture(s) affecting the dorsal spine (especially if the fractures are multiple).

If there is any doubt, a CT scan and/or MRI of the spine will confirm that there are no signs suggestive of another cause, particularly tumour.
