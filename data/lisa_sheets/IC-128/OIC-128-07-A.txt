Regardless of the patient's age, the following dietary hygiene measures should always be implemented:

- ensure a "satisfactory dietary calcium intake" of around 1 to 1.2 g per day and an optimal serum vitamin D level (≥ 30 ng/mL):

 - if necessary, by prescribing calcium supplements (after assessing the patient's dietary intake using a questionnaire) and vitamin D in the majority of cases,

- The calcium content of certain highly mineralised mineral waters (Contrex®, Hépar®, Courmayeur®, etc.) should not be overlooked;

- Encourage patients to make "therapeutic lifestyle changes": maintain regular physical activity, weight-bearing, change their diet;

- advising people to stop smoking and treating alcoholism;

- prevent or combat the occurrence of falls in the elderly.

Therapeutic measures must be combined with them

- prescribe analgesics for pain;

- prescription of a simple orthopaedic device (corset) in the case of disabling spinal pain following a vertebral fracture;
