'''Primary osteoporosis''' is more common in women. It is known as ''post-menopausal osteoporosis''. Secondary osteoporosis is more common in men (around 50% of cases). It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between primary and secondary osteoporosis, and the causes may be interrelated.

The search for a cause of secondary osteoporosis is important, particularly in men, but not exclusively:

- primary hyperparathyroidism

- corticosteroid therapy,

- hypogonadism,

- genetic haemochromatosis,

- digestive tract diseases: gastrectomy, extensive intestinal resections, inflammatory enterocolopathies, malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease in particular),

- chronic inflammatory diseases not treated with corticosteroids (rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, etc.),

- hyperthyroidism,

- anorexia nervosa...
