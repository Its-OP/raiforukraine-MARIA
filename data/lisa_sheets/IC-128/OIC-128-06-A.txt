The biological work-up is used to rule out a secondary cause and other causes of bone fragility, which are managed differently.

There is no consensus on which biological tests should be carried out systematically.

Initially, it may be proposed to measure :

- haemogram,

- CRP,

- '''serum protein electrophoresis''',

- '''calcemia''',

- phosphatemia,

- creatinine levels with estimation of clearance using the CKD-EPI formula,

- 25-OH-vitamin D.

These tests may then be supplemented by biological assays to identify a secondary cause of osteoporosis, depending on the interview, clinical examination and initial results:

- PTH (hyperparathyroidism),

- TSH (hyperthyroidism or overdosage of thyroid hormone during treatment),

- Midnight cortisol +/- minute braking +/- 24-hour cortisoluria with creatinuria (endogenous hypercortisolism),

- Transferrin saturation coefficient (haemochromatosis),

- Plasma testosterone (hypogonadism in men).
