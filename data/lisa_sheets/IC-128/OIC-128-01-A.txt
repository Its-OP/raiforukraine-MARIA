Osteoporosis is a ''generalized skeletal disease'' characterized by ''decreased bone strength'' predisposing to a high risk of fracture. Bone strength is the result of bone density and bone quality (in particular, changes in bone microarchitecture).

FRACTURES'' are "the" complication of osteoporotic disease and constitute the seriousness of this disease. In practice, any fracture occurring after a low-energy trauma (such as a fall from a height) AND after the age of 50 should raise the suspicion of osteoporosis.

Certain so-called ''SEVERE'' FRACTURES are associated with an excess of ''MORTALITY''. These are :

- fractures of the upper end of the femur (FESF),

- the upper end of the humerus (FESH),

- vertebrae,

- of the pelvis (sacrum and ischiopubic and iliopubic branches),

- of the proximal tibia.

In addition to these severe fractures, other so-called "NON-SEVERE" fractures (wrist and other fractures) should not be overlooked.
