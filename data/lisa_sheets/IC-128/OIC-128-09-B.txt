On standard radiographs :

- homogenous demineralisation,

- without signs of cortical osteolysis,

- absence of other signs.

In the spine :

- Location: under the third dorsal vertebra

.        Loss of vertebral body height

- absence of cortical osteolysis: "puzzle sign": although fractured, the cortical bone of the vertebra can be followed along its entire length, in particular, respect for the posterior vertebral wall and the posterior arch (in particular the pedicles)

However, none of these signs is totally specific.
