Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) of the lower limbs is a major public health problem. Its overall prevalence is estimated at between 30% and 60%, depending on the study, in industrialised countries, with a clear preponderance of women (male-female sex ratio = 1/3), although this tends to even out with age. In 2011 in France, around 20 million patients had a CVI and over 400,000 patients had a venous ulcer.
