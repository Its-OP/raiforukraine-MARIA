'''''Venous ulcers''''' (''SDD-[[Skin ulcer SD-092|cutaneous ulcer]]'') are the final stage of CVI.

Its main features are:

* Peri-malleolar location
* Superficial, non-digging appearance,
* Exudative and fibrinous ulcer,
* Large size,
* The presence of signs of CVI and/or associated varicose veins.

Exceptionally, after many years without healing, it may develop into a carcinoma. Biopsy is indicated in cases of exuberant budding.
