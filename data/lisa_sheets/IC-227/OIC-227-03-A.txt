Deep vein thrombosis can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). There are two main possible mechanisms: valve destruction, which causes reflux, and/or residual venous obstruction. This results in signs of venous insufficiency, which may even lead to venous claudication.  

The severity of PTS depends on the extent of venous dysfunction resulting from the sequelae of post-thrombotic syndrome (valvular destruction, residual venous obstruction and venous reflux). Its severity is assessed using the Villalta score, which is based on subjective and objective clinical signs of venous insufficiency (Villalta score given as an indication).

''' Score ≤ 4: no TPS;'''

''' Score 5-9 : moderate SPT'''

''' Score 10-14 : intermediate SPT'''

''' Score ≥ 15 or ulcer present: severe TPS''''
