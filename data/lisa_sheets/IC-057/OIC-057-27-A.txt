From the moment the child is taken into care, physical and psychological care and protection must be implemented in an integrated and perfectly coordinated way.  

Physical care depending on the injuries:

           - analgesics (/! pain treatment is often forgotten)

           - care for burns, fractures, wounds...

           - renutrition, treatment of vitamin deficiencies (serious negligence)

           - specific care: intracranial bleeding (neuroprotection, neurosurgical monitoring)

Psychological care: significant risk of psycho-trauma (dissociation)

Protection: assessing the danger ([[Child abuse and children at risk: medical and administrative guidance 2C-057-PC-A01]])
