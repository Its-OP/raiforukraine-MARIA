Judicial report = a written document sent to the judicial authority represented by the public prosecutor (procureur de la république) in which the elements and facts leading to the belief that a minor is in a situation of immediate danger and/or is the victim of an offence are reported in detail.

The magistrate to whom the case is referred may decide to take criminal or civil action.

Judicial reporting is appropriate in the following situations:

- A particularly serious situation,

- Protection and/or criminal investigation emergencies

- Parents may not cooperate with child protection services


Information of concern (NB: the term "administrative report" is no longer used) = a detailed written report of a situation of danger or risk of danger sent to the unit responsible for collecting and processing information of concern in the relevant departmental councils.


These documents must be factual and include the identity and contact details of both the minor and the writer.

Reported statements are in inverted commas or the conditional tense.

Medical findings (clinical examination data and paraclinical results) are precise, dated and reported in the present tense.

No third party must be named and no one must be held accountable.

These documents (IP and SJ) cannot be passed on to the parents and are not formal parts of the patient's medical file.<ref>https://www.conseil-national.medecin.fr/sites/default/files/modele_signalement_mineur.pdf</ref>

The parents are informed of the drafting of these documents, unless this is contrary to the child's best interests.


CRIP = cellule de recueil et de traitement des informations préoccupantes. It is a multi-disciplinary departmental body responsible for collecting information of concern, assessing the corresponding situations and deciding on the most appropriate referrals (administrative or judicial).
