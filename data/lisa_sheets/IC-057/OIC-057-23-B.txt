The requisition of a person is the injunction made to a professional by a judicial or administrative authority to perform an urgent act. Medical requests in forensic paediatrics mainly involve requests for clinical examinations in cases of violence of all kinds. These requests for qualified personnel are motivated by the need to carry out findings or technical or scientific examinations. A rapid, high-quality response ensures that the investigation in progress continues to run smoothly. Requisitions are not expert opinions, either in form or in substance. The reform of forensic medicine, implemented in 2011 (circulars dated 27 and 28 December 2010 and 25 April 2012), has enabled these procedures to be carried out across the country.
