<blockquote>/!The term sexual abuse should be abandoned in favour of sexual violence or assault</blockquote>Violence is often intrafamilial or committed by an adult who knows the child

The diagnostic circumstances are as follows (sometimes in combination)

           - disclosure by the child

           - discovery of suspicious lesions during a clinical examination

           - questions from family and friends

           - aspecific symptoms that should raise the diagnosis: urinary or faecal continence problems, unexplained chronic pain, behavioural problems including eating disorders, agitation, regression, depression, suicidal thoughts/attempts

Suspicion of sexual violence warrants a specialist paediatric opinion (UAPED or equivalent). /! The doctor's role is to protect the child, not to act as an investigator. He or she must not judge the truth or otherwise of what is said (by the child or those around him or her).
