'''Radiological examinations'''

Any suspected abuse of a child under the age of 2 should be investigated by

- Cerebral MRI as a complement to CT more easily accessible in emergencies

/CT is not a substitute for MRI, but it can be used for urgent diagnosis.

- X-ray of the complete skeleton. If there is any doubt, parts of the skeleton can be X-rayed again 15 days after the initial images.

- abdominal ultrasound (particularly if the clinical examination suggests an abdominal impact or if the biological work-up shows an increase in transaminases and lipase).

Non-radiological examinations

An ophthalmological examination to check for retinal haemorrhages as a matter of relative urgency, at best within 24 hours.

A complete blood count and coagulation test to look for haemostasis disorders (bruising, intracranial haemorrhage). Other blood tests may be necessary depending on the infant's clinical condition and the likelihood of differential diagnoses ([Maltreatment and children at risk: clinical investigation 2C-057-DP-A07]).
