The diagnostic circumstances are as follows

- malaise, especially if hypotonia and pallor are present

- vomiting (HTIC)

- neurological abnormalities: hypotonia, convulsions, irritability, somnolence, bulging of the anterior fontanelle, appearance of strabismus

- developmental abnormalities: acceleration of the CP curve, arrest or regression of psychomotor development

- bruising of the chest and/or arms (related to shaking) or any other skin lesions related to other violence (bruising, mucous membrane or skin lesions, fractures, burns) = '''SENTINAL LESIONS'''

Suspicion of cranial trauma caused by shaking should lead to an emergency cerebral CT or MRI scan.

/!: Transfontanellar ultrasound is not a good test for diagnosing intracranial bleeding.

/A CT scan can be used to diagnose bleeding as a matter of urgency. MRI is complementary and, in particular, allows good visualisation of the cortex, trunk and medulla.
