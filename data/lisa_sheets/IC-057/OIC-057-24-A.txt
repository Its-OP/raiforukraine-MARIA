In the absence of registers, it is difficult to know the exact incidence of child abuse, but it is estimated that 10% of children in France and in high-income countries are victims of abuse. This is much more common than purpura fulminans or childhood cancer.

These risk factors are linked to :

- the vulnerability of the child/adolescent: chronic illness, prematurity, disability, behavioural or neurodevelopmental problems. Early separation of an infant from its parents, for whatever reason (prolonged neonatal hospitalisation, for example), can compromise attachment.

- vulnerability of family and friends :

           - insecure or violent environment: domestic violence, history of violence or risk situation in siblings

           - parental history: violence, psychiatric illness, addiction, bereavement

           - compromised attachment: early, unwanted, concealed or denied pregnancy

           - social insecurity: cramped accommodation, stress linked to financial difficulties, vacancy, isolation
