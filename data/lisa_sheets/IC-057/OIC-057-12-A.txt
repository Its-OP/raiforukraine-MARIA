The discovery of an unexplained fracture or a fracture suspected of being inflicted should lead to a full radiological assessment of the bones, which should be supplemented by a second imaging test: either another radiographic assessment after 10 days, or a bone scan or MRI. In some cases, a CT scan may be discussed with specialists (suspected osteogenesis imperfecta, exploration of the ribs).

This assessment of the skeleton enables the diagnosis of other fractures (of different ages) indicative of Silverman syndrome and also enables the differential diagnoses to be explored.
