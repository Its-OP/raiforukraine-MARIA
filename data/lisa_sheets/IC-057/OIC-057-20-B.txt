Abuse is one of the negative experiences of childhood that can lead to short-, medium- and long-term physical, psychological and social health complications, with an increased risk of :

- post-traumatic stress disorder

- other psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders, behavioural disorders or suicidal behaviour

- neurodevelopmental and psycho-affective development disorders

- social exclusion

- somatic diseases, in particular cardiovascular or even inflammatory diseases
<br /><blockquote>/ : The serious consequences of abuse justify prolonged monitoring in cases of suspected or proven abuse. In addition, attention must be paid to systematic monitoring ([[Monitoring of a normal infant, child and adolescent. Screening for orthopaedic anomalies, visual, hearing and dental problems. Compulsory health examinations. School medicine. Child mortality and morbidity), which is often less frequent for abused children than for other children, even though the health needs of an abused child are greater.
