The discovery of a fracture in a child who is not moving around (not walking around) should first and foremost suggest an inflicted trauma, all the more so as the circumstances in which the fracture occurred are unknown, fluctuate or are incompatible with the fracture. The absence of pain associated with the fracture ("chance" discovery) is also a cause for concern.
