Suggesting abuse in the presence of

- certain physical injuries (see identifying the basic traumatic injuries in abuse):

- regression in psychomotor development or learning, behavioural, sleeping or eating problems, stagnation in growth, poor hygiene, etc.

- dropping out of or over-involvement in school

- agitation, aggression, violence ("violence suffered, violence acted upon"), running away and other endangerments

- somatomorphic disorders, multiple consultations for "vague" symptoms

- consultation for a child psychiatry reason such as a suicide attempt, depressive episode, eating disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.


Raising the possibility of abuse does not always mean that the diagnosis will ultimately be made, but the situations described above should lead to the hypothesis being put forward and to an interview, an examination of the health record, a physical examination or even additional tests being carried out to look for other arguments ("Abuse and children at risk: clinical investigation 2C-057-DP-A07").

In some cases, the suspicion of abuse is brought to light by an adult in the child's entourage (school, PMI childminder in particular) or by the child or teenager him/herself who reveals acts of violence.
