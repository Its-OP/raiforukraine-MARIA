The violence of the jolts (by gripping the chest or both arms and then violent multidirectional movements) causes the head to accelerate and decelerate, more often from front to back, with an angular acceleration responsible for rupturing the bridging veins which cause extra-axial sub-dural haemorrhages, retinal haemorrhages and also cerebral, spinal cord and cervical lesions.

These jolts can be repeated over time on multiple occasions.
