The risk factors for shaking are integrated more generally into the risk factors for abuse

The factors associated with a higher risk of cranial trauma caused by shaking are defined by the HAS as follows

- male sex ;

- prematurity or perinatal medical complications ;

- separation of mother and child in the neonatal period ;

- multiple or close pregnancies ;

- unwanted pregnancy ;

- crying that parents can't stand, and a feeling of percussion among childminders;

- difficulty acquiring a regular sleep rhythm, sleep disorders ;

- food difficulties ;

- previous interventions by social services.

Shaken Baby Syndrome usually (but not always) occurs in infants under 12 months of age, peaking at around 6 months.

/! Crying that is perceived by child carers as excessive can be a triggering factor in a pre-existing context of psychological vulnerability and exhaustion in the parent/perpetrating adult. During a consultation for an infant's crying, it is therefore very important to focus on any vulnerabilities, remove any guilt, and make the parent aware of and verbalise their emotions when faced with their infant's crying (using the anger thermometer, for example https://promotionsante.chusj.org/fr/Boite-a-outils/Capsules/Un-developpement-optimal-de-l-enfant/Le-thermometre-de-la-colere).
