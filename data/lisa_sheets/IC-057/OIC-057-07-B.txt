Subdural haematoma: crescent-shaped hyperdensity, in a convexity, extra parenchymal

- Plurifocal, they are uni or bilateral, in the cerebral scythe and/or cerebellar tent.

- sometimes associated with subarachnoid haemorrhage.

Visualisation of bridge vein ruptures

The predominance of subdural haematoma and the presence of clots in the vertex due to ruptured bridging veins are, in the acute phase, essential elements of the diagnosis.

A haemorrhage in the cerebral scaffold or cerebellar tent is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. HSDs are not always visible initially because they may be masked by cerebral oedema.
