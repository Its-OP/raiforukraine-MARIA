Injuries associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome :

- cerebral lesions: HSD, intracerebral bleeding and anoxoischaemic lesions

- cervical and spinal cord injuries

- Retinal damage (haemorrhage, detachment, tearing) and vitreous damage

- cutaneo-skeletal lesions linked to the shaking mechanism: bruising of the chest and/or arms, fractured ribs and/or upper limbs = '''SENTINEL LESIONS'''

- intra-abdominal visceral injuries: contusion of the liver or spleen

- injuries linked to other associated physical violence: bruises, mucous membrane or skin injuries, burns = ''SENTINAL INJURIES,'' fractures whatever their location, intra-abdominal injuries, etc.

/The presence of a sentinel lesion in an infant who is unable to move should prompt an urgent search for associated traumatic lesions (full skeletal X-ray, fundus examination, brain imaging, abdominal imaging).
