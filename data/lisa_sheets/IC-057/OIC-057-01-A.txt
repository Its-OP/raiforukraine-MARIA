Shaken baby syndrome" is also known as non-accidental head trauma due to shaking.

This is a craniocerebral trauma caused by violent shaking, sometimes associated with an impact.

This syndrome results in a more or less complete combination of intracranial lesions (subdural haematomas, cerebral lesions, which may lead to atrophy in the long term), spinal cord and intra-spinal cord lesions, ocular and periocular lesions (retinal haemorrhage, vitreous haemorrhage, orbital cavity haemorrhage, with possible ischaemia of the retina in the long term due to hypoperfusion) <ref>https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2017-09/fs_1_bebe_secoue.pdf</ref>
