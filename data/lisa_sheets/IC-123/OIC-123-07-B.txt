'''Economic consequences:''''

The increase in the number of elderly people has economic consequences:

1-increase in direct and indirect healthcare expenditure:

* high consumption of care and hospitalisation ;
* the cost of social benefits paid to the elderly, and in particular the personalised autonomy allowance (APA) granted to dependent elderly people;
* the need for places in geriatric institutions, particularly in residential establishments for the dependent elderly (EHPAD);

2-creation of a specific economic activity:

* jobs in the home help sector,
* jobs in geriatric establishments,
* jobs in the medico-social sector,
* geronto-technologies and their development (technical aid equipment, medical chairs and beds, remote assistance and home automation companies, hearing aids): the "silver economy".

3-significant economic power (large part of the assets)

The issue of pensions is crucial in the French system, where contributions from working people - young adults - fund the pensions of older people.

'''Social consequences'''

The ageing of the population, a source of social change, must raise questions about the place of the elderly in society, with increasingly large families (families of four or even five generations), where the elderly help to finance the youngest. The retirement age of 60, early retirement and the improvement in the population's state of health have created a generation of young retirees in good health, with time on their hands and, for many of them, great professional skills. Some are involved in activities that are useful to society: political life, associations, voluntary work, etc.
