Ageing is defined as the set of physiological processes that modify the structure and functions of the body from middle age onwards. Ageing is not a pathological process.

Ageing is a slow, gradual process that combines genetic and environmental factors with random (stochastic) factors. It represents a factor of vulnerability when it comes to coping with stressful situations, but no subject becomes symptomatic simply because of the consequences of ageing.
