== Iron deficiency ==
The French National Authority for Health (HAS) recommends supplementation (with 50 mg of iron metal per day) only for patients with anaemia proven by CBC (Hb < 11 g/dL in the 1st<sup> and 2nd<sup> trimester, Hb < 10.5 g/dL in the 3rd trimester) or a low ferritin level (< 12 Î¼g/dL).
<br />

== '''Vitamin D and calcium deficiency''' ==
Vitamin D supplementation is systematically recommended at the end of the 2nd trimester (100,000 IU per os in a single dose).


Intakes of > 1000 mg of calcium per day are recommended during pregnancy. This corresponds to the consumption of 3 to 4 dairy products per day.
