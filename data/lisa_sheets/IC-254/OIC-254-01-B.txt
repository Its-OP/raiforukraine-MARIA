Pregnant women's energy requirements increase during pregnancy (by an average of 70, 260 and 500 kcal/d in the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>th</sup> and 3<sup>th</sup> trimesters, respectively). This increase in energy requirements is usually covered by an increase in ingesta.

Requirements for certain vitamins and micronutrients are also increased. Part of these needs are covered by the increase in ingesta. In addition, intestinal absorption of iron and calcium increases.

However, as dietary habits are sometimes quite different from the standards recommended for the general population, certain needs (vitamins A, B9, C and D, iron and iodine) may not be covered by increasing dietary intake alone.
