* Tobacco and social inequalities
** Since 2000, daily smoking has fallen among the most disadvantaged smokers: from 38.8% in 2016 to 33.0% in 2018 (people on the lowest incomes), and from 49.7% to 40% (unemployed people).
** tobacco is a powerful social marker: in 2018, the higher the income, the lower the prevalence of daily smoking.
