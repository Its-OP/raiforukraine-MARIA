'''Primary prevention'''

In France, the Veil law of 1976, the Evin law of 1991 and the Bertrand decree of 2006 have curbed the expansion of smoking.

* The main measures recommended are :
* A ban on all direct and indirect advertising.
* Repeated and dissuasive price increases for all tobacco products.
* Protection against exposure to passive smoking (public places and workplaces).
* Education and information: health warnings in the form of images on packets.

The 2014-2019 National Tobacco Reduction Programme (PNRT) included 3 major measures:

# Introduction of plain packaging
# Reimbursement of nicotine substitutes or varenicline by the French health insurance system
# Introduction of a "No Smoking Month" every November.

The 2018-2022 National Programme for Tobacco Control includes regional variations:

# Protecting our children and preventing them from taking up smoking
# Encouraging and supporting smokers to quit
# Act on the tobacco economy to protect public health
# Monitor, evaluate, research and disseminate knowledge about tobacco

Its ambition is that, by 2032, children born since 2014 will become the first generation of non-smoking adults (<5% smokers).

Secondary prevention

All healthcare professionals should be involved in smoking prevention (from school age) and helping people to stop smoking.

The factors most predictive of smoking cessation are

* Good socio-economic level,
* Low tobacco consumption,
* No one around them smokes,
* Low alcohol consumption,
* Late onset of intoxication,
* Short duration of intoxication,
* Long delay between awakening and first cigarette,
* Strong motivation to quit
