It is important to assess psychiatric co-morbidities and co-addictions prior to smoking cessation.

*Psychiatric disorders
**Schizophrenia 82% of smokers
**Bipolar disorder 56% of smokers
**Look for anxiety disorders and major depressive episodes.
***there are links between difficulty in quitting and depressive symptoms
***There are anxiety and depressive symptoms induced by withdrawal:
**** lasting a few weeks => no pharmacological treatment but support in consultation
**** beyond => specific psychiatric treatment
**At a distance from withdrawal, improvement in anxiety and depressive symptoms and quality of life.  <br />
