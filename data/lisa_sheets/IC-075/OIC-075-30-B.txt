Relapses are the rule => systematically suggest quitting

*Craving and withdrawal syndrome are factors in relapse.
*Alcohol and cannabis use are factors in relapse.

The quality and frequency of follow-up improve the chances of successful weaning.

* The frequency should be agreed with the smoker (6 to 12 months).
* A "successful" withdrawal is one that lasts â‰¥ 1 year.
* Regular follow-up helps prevent relapses.

Relapse must be played down (often a necessary stage in learning to live without tobacco).

* reward the efforts made
* analyse the circumstances of the relapse
* maintaining follow-up with a view to a new attempt.
