The pathogen is a small Gram-negative cocobacillus: Pasteurella multocida, whose main reservoir is animals (cats ++), but which is also present in the environment.

The diagnosis of pasteurellosis is mainly clinical. It involves the rapid appearance (3 to 6 hours) of a major inflammatory aspect around the inoculation wound after an animal [[Bites and stings SD-169|bite or scratch]] or plant sting.

A discharge may be present. Lymphangitis and adenopathy may be associated.

Biological diagnosis is based on blood cultures or cultures taken from superficial local samples of the wound.
