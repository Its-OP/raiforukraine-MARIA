The recognition of rabies risk situations in France is based on the following elements:

*type of contact: bite, scratch, lick on injured skin or mucous membrane
*by an animal capable of transmitting rabies: animal imported from a rabies enzootic zone, bite abroad by a traveller (rabies enzootic zone), bat (including in France: chiropteran rabies)
*the victim's rabies vaccination status.

France is free from rabies in non-flying land animals.

Treatment is based on preventive treatment administered in an anti-rabies centre to which the patient must be referred.
