Clinical diagnosis:

-The disease is more common in children and young adults. It should be suspected in the presence of [[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|adenopathies]] limited to a single site (usually cervical or axillary) in the drainage territory of an inoculation lesion (bite or scratch) found in 50% of cases. Adenopathies are firm, tender and inflammatory, with the possibility of fistulisation. General signs are discreet. Questioning should look for any history of [[Bites and stings SD-169|scratch or bite]] or contact with cats (kittens+++) in the previous 2 to 3 weeks (average incubation period).

Biological diagnosis:

Serology (''Bartonella henselae'') is the first-line test. It has a low sensitivity, so a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis.

-A specific PCR on lymph node exeresis can be carried out in cases of diagnostic doubt.
