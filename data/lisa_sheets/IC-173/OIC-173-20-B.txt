cutaneous leishmaniasis is ''mainly an infection of travellers or migrants''. The most common geographical areas of infection are North Africa, the Middle East, West Africa and South America. The species most often implicated are "Leishmania major, L. tropica, L. guyanensis".  

Cutaneous leishmaniasis can occasionally be contracted in France (Languedoc, Roussillon, Cévennes, Alpes de Haute Provence) and in countries around the Mediterranean, although the species endemic in these areas (''L. infantum'') is more likely to be responsible for visceral leishmaniasis.   

The infection is transmitted by haematophagous insects (female sandflies), the species of which vary according to geographical area.

It manifests itself as a cutaneous lesion on an uncovered area (0.5 to 2 cm), initially in the form of a carmine papule, infiltrated, with secondary ulceration and crusting, surrounded by a red, painless pad. The lesion may become super-infected, giving the appearance of pyoderma. The clinical presentation (ulcerated or crusted) and size of lesions may vary depending on the species of leishmaniasis.

It develops chronically over several months, and generally heals spontaneously, leaving an indelible scar.

Diffuse forms are observed in immunocompromised patients or with certain species.
