1. pregnant woman: (see also item 27)

Objective: primary and secondary prevention of congenital transmission of the parasite

Legal obligation: Public Health Code, chapter on "Preventive examinations during and after pregnancy".

- initial serology during the 1st<sup>trimester</sup> of pregnancy to establish the immune status of the pregnant woman with regard to toxoplasma infection (absence of immunisation, immunity reflecting a past or recent infection)

- if serology is negative (no immunisation): monthly check throughout pregnancy, and 2-3 weeks after delivery.

In the event of seroconversion during pregnancy (appearance of IgG in a previously negative woman): prevention and detection of foetal infection (maternal treatment, amniocentesis for antenatal screening) and then of the newborn (postnatal screening).

'''2.     Immunocompromised

Identify patients at risk of serious primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection, so that prophylactic measures (hygiene and diet) or chemoprophylaxis can be put in place.

- HIV-infected patients: toxoplasmosis serology, carried out as part of the initial work-up following the discovery of HIV infection, is used to identify patients at risk (CD4+ lymphocytes < 200/mm<sup>3</sup>) of reactivation of a latent toxoplasma infection (anti-Toxoplasma IgG seropositive patients), or of severe primary infection (anti-Toxoplasma IgG seronegative patients). This serology is checked annually if the patient is seronegative.

-Patients receiving haematopoietic stem cell transplants and patients receiving solid organ transplants: legal requirement for serological screening to identify patterns (donor and recipient toxoplasmosis serological status) at risk of serious progressive toxoplasmosis.

Diagnosing a primary infection or reactivation in an immunocompromised patient (HIV infection and CD4+ < 200/mm<sup>3</sup>, haematopoietic stem cell transplant, solid organ transplant)

- In the event of clinical (neurological, ocular, pulmonary, etc.) and/or radiological signs suggestive of progressive toxoplasmosis (cerebral in 70% of cases). It occurs mainly in cases of CD4 < 200/mm<sup>3</sup>.

'''3.     Immunocompetent patients with suggestive symptoms'''

In immunocompetent individuals, toxoplasma infection is symptomatic in less than 20% of cases. The main symptoms are asthenia, fever and polyadenopathy, particularly of the cervico-occipital region.

'''4.     Retinochoroiditis in the immunocompetent or immunosuppressed patient'''

'''5.     Organ donors:''' regulatory obligation in France
