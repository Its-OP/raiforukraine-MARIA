The bacterium in question is ''Bartonella henselae'', a small intracellular BGN that is difficult to culture.

Humans are most often infected through cat bites or scratches.

In cats, infection is more common in kittens and young cats.

In humans, from the inoculation lesion, the bacteria multiply in a relay lymph node. This adenopathy is the site of an inflammatory reaction with epithelioid granuloma with non-caseous necrosis, associated with follicular hyperplasia and the presence of microabscesses.
