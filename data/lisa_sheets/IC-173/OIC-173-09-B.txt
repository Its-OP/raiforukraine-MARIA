The primary phase is also known as the "early localised phase" of Lyme disease, or "Erythema migrans".

The clinical finding of erythema migrans requires treatment to be prescribed straight away, without the need for further examination.

Because of poor sensitivity at this stage, serology is not recommended in the presence of erythema migrans.

Curative treatment involves 14 days' "per os" antibiotic therapy with doxycycline in adults, and amoxicillin in children under 8.
