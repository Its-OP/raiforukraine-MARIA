Clinical signs vary according to the stage of the disease.
[[File:Erythememigrant.png|vignette|Erytheme migrant]]
'''In the early localised phase''', '''the diagnosis of erythema migrans is clinical and pathognomonic''', appearing 3 to 30 days after the bite:

*Erythematous macule centred on the tick bite site (inconsistent).
*Extended by an active centrifugal erythematous annular border with a lighter centre.
*Classically painless and not pruritic.
*The threshold of at least 5 cm in diameter contributes to the specificity of the clinical diagnosis.
*Spontaneous disappearance in 3 to 4 weeks.

'''Early and late disseminated phases''' may cause neurological manifestations (facial paralysis <ref>[[2C-101-ET-A01]]</ref>, meningo-radiculoneuritis), articular (Lyme arthritis), dermatological and more rarely ocular or cardiac. At this stage the diagnosis is based on :

*A compatible epidemiological context
*Compatible clinical signs
*Serological diagnosis is a 2-stage indirect diagnosis designed to combine sensitivity and specificity.  It is based on a sensitive serological test (ELISA) which must be confirmed by a specific test (Western Blot).
*The [[Interpretation of a SD-236 serology result|Lyme serology]] is considered '''positive only if these 2 tests are positive.'''
*Serology (ELISA and Western blot) cannot distinguish between an active infection and a serological scar, which explains the importance of the presence of clinical signs.
