Humans are generally infected following a ''[[Bites and stings SD-169|bite]]'' or scratch with skin penetration'' by an infected animal (presence of the virus in the saliva).

Infection can also be acquired by ''projection of infected salivary droplets onto mucous membranes'' (conjunctiva+++) or contact of the animal's saliva ''(licking) on a skin area with pre-existing effraction''.
