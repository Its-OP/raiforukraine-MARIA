Lyme disease is transmitted by the [[Bites and stings SD-169|bite of a hard tick]] of the genus ''Ixodes.''

People are mainly bitten when walking in the forest, or when carrying out agricultural or forestry work.

When a tick bites, it inoculates the bacteria belonging to the genus Borrelia (family of spirochetes) by regurgitation during a blood meal. Lyme disease is caused by infection with B. burgdorferi senso latus (group of species).
