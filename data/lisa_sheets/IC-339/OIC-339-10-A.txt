* '''There are 3 methods of revascularisation:'''
** Thrombolysis =''' this is a fibrinolytic treatment administered intravenously and is only useful in ST+ ACS for which the time to revascularisation by angioplasty is >120 minutes.
** Percutaneous coronary angioplasty =''' It is performed after coronary angiography and consists of inflating a balloon at the coronary lesion, followed by placement of a stent.
** Coronary artery bypass grafting =''' This surgical technique consists of anastomosing a mammary artery or saphenous vein downstream of the coronary stenosis or occlusion in order to revascularise the heart downstream of the lesion.

* '''In ST+ ACS:'''
** '''Coronary angioplasty performed in the acute phase is the reference method of revascularisation for ST+ ACS.'''
** Thrombolysis is only indicated for patients with ST+ ACS if the time between first medical contact and reopening of the artery by angioplasty is > 120 minutes.
** Except in exceptional circumstances, coronary artery bypass surgery is not performed in the acute phase of ST+ ACS.

* '''In ST- ACS:''''
** Coronary angiography is performed within 24-48 hours of admission.
** There is no indication for thrombolysis in ST-ACS.
** The choice of revascularisation method (bypass versus angioplasty) depends on the severity and complexity of the lesions, the presence of diabetes and LV dysfunction.

* '''In stable angina:'''
** The choice between a conservative strategy (medication alone) and an invasive strategy to propose revascularisation (bypass, coronary angioplasty) depends on numerous parameters.
** On the other hand, numerous studies comparing optimal medical treatment with or without a systematic revascularisation strategy have shown no significant difference between the 2 strategies.
** The main reasons for proposing an invasive strategy and a revascularisation procedure are :
*** The severity of symptoms and their refractory nature to medical treatment
*** The existence of left ventricular dysfunction
*** Extensive ischaemia under treatment
