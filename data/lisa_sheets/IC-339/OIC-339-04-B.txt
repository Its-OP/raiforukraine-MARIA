* For ACS (ST+ or ST-) = the cause of ACS is, in the vast majority of cases, a rupture of an atheromatous plaque or an erosion of the vascular endothelium leading to acute thrombosis resulting in complete (ST+) or partial (ST-) obstruction of a coronary artery.
* ''Stable angina'' = an ''atheromatous plaque causing significant stenosis'' of the lumen of the vessel leading, on exertion, to a mismatch between supply and demand => ''exertional ischaemia'' only.
