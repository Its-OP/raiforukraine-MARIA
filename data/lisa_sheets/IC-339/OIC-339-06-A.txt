* '''Knowing the location of an ST+ ACS = knowing the ST segment elevation territory:'''
** V1-V4 = anterosepto-apical (anterior)
** V5, V6 = low lateral
** D1,aVL = high lateral
** V1-V6 = extended anterior
** DII,DIII,aVF = inferior
** V7,V8,V9 = posterior
** V3R, V4R = right ventricle

* '''ECG signs of ST+ ACS (in order of appearance):''''
** large T wave, broad and symmetrical,
** then at least 1mm supershift in two contiguous leads, encompassing the T wave,
** then Q wave of necrosis.
** The overshift is associated with a mirror ST segment undershift in the opposite leads (e.g. anterior for a posterior infarct).

'''The appearance of a left bundle branch block has the same diagnostic value as an overshoot if associated with chest pain suggestive of an ACS.'''

* '''ECG sign of ST- ACS:'''
** '''The ECG may be normal.'''
** The following abnormalities may also be found: ST segment undershift, negative T wave, biphasic T wave (positive and negative).
** These abnormalities must be systematised within a territory.
