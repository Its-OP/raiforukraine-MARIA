* '''Any chest pain = 18-lead ECG'''
* Caution: do not forget the leads exploring the right VD (V3r and V4r) and the posterior leads (V7, V8 and V9)''''
* '''Persistent chest pain = repeat ECG'''
* Troponin measurement should not delay management. It is not necessary for the diagnosis or the start of management.
* '''If ST- ACS is suspected''' = measure troponin at H0.
** If positive, the diagnosis is made.
** If negative, repeat at H1 or H3.
** The type of troponin: ultrasensitive or conventional, defines the length of the cycle: H0-H1 cycle with ultrasensitive troponin and H0-H3 with conventional troponin.
** H1 or H3 positivity or an increase in value of +30% indicates pathology.
** Finally, a very low ultrasensitive troponin threshold in a patient with pain at H3 means that ACS can be ruled out on admission without the need for a cycle. <br />
