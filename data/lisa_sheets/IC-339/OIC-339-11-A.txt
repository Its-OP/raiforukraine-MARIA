* '''For ST+ ACS, 1 objective = REVASCULARISE as quickly as possible. The diagram below summarises the choices between fibrinolysis and primary angioplasty depending on the delay''''

** '''Care by the SAMU:'''
*** Preparation (peripheral venous line, O2 if SpO2<90%)
*** '''Antithrombotic treatments with 2 PLAQUETARY ANTIAGGREGANTS = ASPIRIN 250mg IV + 1 P2Y12 INHIBITOR (Prasugrel 60mg or Ticagrelor 180mg or if CI Clopidogrel 600mg)''' AND '''1 IV ANTICOAGULANT (Unfractionated Heparin 70-100IU/kg or Enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg IV)'''
*** Analgesic treatment = ''PARACETAMOL + MORPHINE TITRATION'' if necessary
*** RAPID TRANSFER TO A CATHETERISATION ROOM. IF TIME > 120 MINUTES BETWEEN FIRST MEDICAL CONTACT AND ANGIOPLASTY => INDICATION FOR FIBRINOLYSIS by TENECTAPLASE, IV)
** '''In-patient management:''' CORONARY DESOBSTRUCTION BY PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY WITH STENT PLACEMENT
** '''During hospitalisation (minimum 3 days):''''
*** SCOPED SURVEILLANCE IN USIC
*** STRONG DOSE STATINE (Atorvastatin 80 mg or Rosuvastatin 20 mg)
*** BETABLOKERS in the absence of contraindication (shock, VAD, low flow, extension to the right ventricle)
*** ACE INHIBITORS
*** CONTINUE DOUBLE PLAQUET ANTIAGGRESSION with aspirin 75-100mg and a P21Y12 inhibitor (Prasugrel 10mg or Ticagrelor 90 mg morning and evening) FOR ONE YEAR (THEN ASPIRIN FOR LIFE)
*** THERAPEUTIC EDUCATION
*** SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS
*** screening for other atherosclerotic lesions (carotid, femoral, aortic)
*** PRESCRIPTION OF CARDIAC REHABILITATION FOLLOWING HOSPITALISATION.

* '''For ACS ST-:'''
** '''Management and treatment are identical to ACS St+ in the following cases:'''
*** Persistent pain
*** Cardiogenic shock
*** High grade ventricular rhythm disorder/conduction disorder
*** Acute heart failure refractory to treatment
*** Persistent ST segment elevation
** '''In all other cases, for ST- ACS, objectives = INITIATE TREATMENTS, STRATIFY RISK:'''
*** '''Management by EMS or emergency department:'''
**** Preparation (peripheral venous access, Scope, O2 if Sao2 < 90%)
**** Antithrombotic treatment = '''1 PLAQUETARY ANTIAGGREGANT (ASPIRIN 250mg IV)''' AND '''1 ANTICOAGULANT ((Unfractionated Heparin 70-100IU/kg IV or Enoxaparin 0.5mg/kg IV or Fondaparinux 2.5 mg SC)'''
*** '''Management in ICU:'''
**** SCOPED SURVEILLANCE
**** HIGH DOSE STATIN
**** BETA BLOCKER
**** ACE inhibitor if left ventricular dysfunction, diabetes or renal disease is present
**** THERAPEUTIC EDUCATION
**** SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS
**** SEARCH FOR OTHER ATHERATING CONDITIONS (carotid, femoral, aortic)
*** '''CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND DISCUSSION OF TREATMENT MODALITIES:'''
**** CORONARY REVASCULARISATION BY PERCUTANEOUS ANGIOPLASTY WITH STENT PLACEMENT OR CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING
**** The second antiplatelet agent is added in the catheterisation room after visualisation of the coronary arteries.
**** DOUBLE PLATELET ANTIAGREGATION IS CONTINUED FOR 1 YEAR (THEN LIFETIME monotherapy)
* '''At discharge for all ACS, regardless of revascularisation modalities'''
** Double antiplatelet therapy
** High-dose statin (Atorvastatin or Rosuvastatin)
** Beta-blocker
ACE inhibitor (ACS ST+, or left ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes, or renal disease) ** ACE inhibitor (ACS ST+, or left ventricular dysfunction, or diabetes, or renal disease)
** Proton pump inhibitor
** Education (warning sign/regimen)
** Cardiac rehabilitation
1 month off work for ACS ST+, 1 to 2 weeks for ACS ST- ** Regular follow-up by cardiologist.
