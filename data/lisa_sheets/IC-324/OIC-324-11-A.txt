Compliance and adherence to treatment are processes that develop over time; unstable, dynamic and modifiable processes. Taking medication to treat a chronic disease will require a change in behaviour, which has been described by PROCHASKA and DI CLEMENTE as an adaptation in five stages (pre-intention, intention, preparation, action, maintenance). Patients' adherence to their treatment will depend on the stage they are at in the process of maturing towards this change in behaviour.

In this context, if there are several pathologies that are more or less accepted depending on the period of diagnosis, the patient's response to therapeutic instructions may differ.

It is all the more so because drugs that are followed by a beneficial effect perceived by the patient will be more marked (asthma attack, migraine, dental pain, etc.), unlike drugs taken as primary prophylaxis which bring no immediate benefit or even undesirable effects (muscle cramps, fatigue, etc.).

The concept of primary prophylaxis must be fully understood and explained to the patient so that he or she feels the potential benefit.
