The WHO has defined five groups of factors that can influence compliance:

- socio-economic factors of the patient and his environment ;

- factors dependent on the care system and its players, particularly in terms of relationships

- factors specific to the patient: level of education, beliefs, etc.

- pathology-related factors

- treatment-related factors, in particular potential adverse effects

The social and behavioural aspects are predominant, implying that an elaborate relational approach must be implemented in any project to improve compliance, particularly through therapeutic education.
