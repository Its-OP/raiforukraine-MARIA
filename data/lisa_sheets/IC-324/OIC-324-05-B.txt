=== '''1-Prescribing:''' ===
- Doctors are free to make their own prescriptions, but the tacit contract between them and the patient makes them liable for all possible consequences.

- Doctors must therefore constantly assess the risk/benefit ratio of their prescriptions, or even of not prescribing at all. This means taking into account patients' expectations, needs and beliefs, alongside an assessment of the disease, co-morbidities and possible treatments.

- This assessment forms the basis for personalising any therapeutic decision, i.e. adapting the prescribed treatment to each patient's particular and individual needs.

=== '''2-Le modèle de décision:''' ===
'''The therapeutic decision can be made according to 3 models:'''

* the paternalistic model:'' the doctor provides top-down information and makes decisions;
* the autonomous patient model:''' the patient informs himself by his own means and decides, together with those close to him;
* the shared decision model:''' everyone contributes their information, knowledge, needs and expectations, and a joint decision is reached by the carer and the patient

=== '''3-L'observance:''' ===
Definition: Compliance is the degree of concordance between the patient's behaviour and the recommendations of the carers, in terms of both prescription and therapeutic follow-up. It comprises two elements: adherence and maintenance of treatment.

===== '''Factors for good compliance:''' =====
- simple administration,

- short-term treatment,

- well-tolerated treatment,

- effective treatment,

- the patient has fully understood the expected benefits, how to take it, the risks of adverse effects and how to monitor it.

===== '''Non-adherence factors:''' =====
- the nature of the condition being treated, especially when the disease is non-symptomatic: over 60% of non-adherence for treatment of a single biological abnormality such as hypercholesterolaemia;

- the complexity of the therapeutic strategy ;

- poor tolerance of treatment ;

- the physiological problems presented by the patient ;

- the degree of motivation ;

- patients not understanding the objectives ;

- the involvement of carers ;

- the absence of public or private insurance cover for care/treatment;

- stress, depression and anxiety in patients.
