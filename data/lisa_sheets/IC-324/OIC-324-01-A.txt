== Definition of therapeutic patient education and its main stages ==
"Therapeutic education is a set of practices designed to enable patients to acquire skills so that they can take active responsibility for their illness, their care and their monitoring, in partnership with their carers". WHO 1998

The objective for healthcare professionals: "To be able to help patients with chronic conditions to acquire the ability to manage their treatment in order to prevent complications resulting from their own illness, while maintaining or improving their quality of life". WHO 1998

In France, ETP is set out in a law (HPST), with implementing decrees specifying the people involved, the procedure and training.
