=== '''1-Le projet pédagogique individualisé: définitions'' ===

* The '''individualised educational project''' is defined as all the steps involved in setting up a therapeutic approach tailored to a patient, encouraging autonomy, decision-making and self-care skills.
* '''" Therapeutic education'' is a set of practices designed to enable patients to acquire the skills they need to take active responsibility for their illness, their care and their monitoring, in partnership with their carers. WHO 1998
* L''''objective for health professionals:'''To be able to help patients with chronic conditions to acquire the ability to manage their treatment in order to prevent complications resulting from their own illness, while maintaining or improving their quality of life''. WHO 1998

=== '''2-Le projet pédagogique individualisé : Indications'' ===
An individualised educational project will be set up for a patient with a chronic illness, to help them improve their independence and quality of life, by developing specific skills.

===== '''Skills to be developed in patients:'' =====

# Self-care skills are decisions that the patient makes with the intention of modifying the effect of the illness on his or her health.
# Adaptation skills are personal and interpersonal skills that enable people to acquire the ability to live in and modify their environment.
# Safety skills are designed to enable patients and those around them to identify and manage high-risk situations (hypoglycaemia in diabetics, fever in immunocompromised patients).

=== '''3-Le projet pédagogique individualisé : 4 étapes'' ===

==== '''Different stages of the educational project''' ====

# Diagnosis is essential for getting to know the patient, identifying his or her needs and expectations, and working with him or her to formulate the skills to be acquired or mobilised. It is the patient's needs and expectations that serve as the guide for developing the programme.
# Defining a personalised therapeutic patient education programme'' - This involves working with the patient to formulate the skills to be acquired or mobilised in the light of their project.
# Plan and implement group and/or individual therapeutic patient education sessions'' - The aim is to plan therapeutic patient education sessions according to the patient's needs and preferences.  - This takes the form of individual sessions lasting 30 to 45 minutes or, more often than not, group or alternating sessions, which are conducive to sharing experiences.
# '''Carry out an individual assessment''' - This enables the patient to take stock of what they have understood, what they know how to do, how they live with their illness on a daily basis, and what they may still need to learn.
