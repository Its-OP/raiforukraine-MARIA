The aim of personalised care is to put the patient at the centre of care by listening to them and understanding what is important to them;

access, through structured dialogue, to the patient's knowledge, representations, feelings, needs, expectations and preferences;

Responses evolve over time according to individual needs and circumstances;

* 10 steps to creating a customised system:

(1) reframe perspectives from 'what's the problem' to 'what's important to you',

(2) Reconsider the real indicators that are important for the population segments under consideration and their values,

(3) empowering citizens by helping them to become experts

(4) moving from a single system to a system adapted to several values and several targets,

(5) reduce competition and increase collaboration between professionals,

(6) accept the control of a connected society and the web (Health data hub)

(7) democratising medical information, accepting recorded traces and patient connections to their own records,

(8) Rely on industry to find and support new solutions,

(9) ask citizens to do this work on values,

(10) Measuring results regardless of the choices made, focusing on individuals and populations
