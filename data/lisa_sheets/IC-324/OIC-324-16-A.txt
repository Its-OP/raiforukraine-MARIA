The "medicinal products for officinal use" decree, published in 2008, authorises certain medicinal products to be made available directly at the counter in dispensing pharmacies.

A list of self-medication medicines can be found on the ANSM website, and there are around 400 specialities available for self-medication, mainly vitamins, medicines for the ENT sphere, veinotonics, gastric dressings, dermatology, pain (ibuprofen, paracetamol), H1 anti-histamines, anti-fatigue, traumatology and rheumatology.

Homeopathic and herbal medicines can also be obtained in this way.
