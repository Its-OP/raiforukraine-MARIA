The best communication technique is to systematically question patients who return for a consultation to find out if they are having difficulty taking their treatment. This questioning should be carried out in the same way as evaluating clinical effectiveness, without making negative judgements or reproaching the patient, who can then address the problem.

We need to work together to identify the obstacles to non-compliance.

This is all the more important if the patient has not improved clinically and/or biologically.

It is important to explain to the patient that it is common and "normal" not to be able to take a treatment properly, which allows us to adopt a benevolent and non-judgemental stance from the outset (the notion of non-judgement).

- Have an empathetic attitude (the ability to put yourself in the other person's shoes to better understand them and make them feel that you understand, without forgetting that you are not the other person).

- Avoid attitudes of :

Medical threats (''you will be dialysed if you continue not to take your treatment, you will have your leg amputated if you continue to smoke...'').

Escape or avoidance

Questions such as:

- Many patients find it difficult to take their treatment, especially over the long term, and it's true that it's complicated. Are you managing to take your treatment? Is it not too difficult?

- Do you ever stop for a few weeks or months?

- We opted for a new painkiller 1 month ago, did you take it? Why didn't you take it? Fear of side effects, tired of taking medication, I don't believe in this treatment, I work shifts and I can't keep to the hours you suggested, I'm afraid of putting on weight..... ....''

Talking about it directly, without judgement, is probably the best way of trying to resolve the problem, especially as this research is carried out soon after the first prescription, without taboos.
