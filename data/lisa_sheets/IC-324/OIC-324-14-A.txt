== '''Definition of the different types of self-medication''' ==


Self-medication is when a patient takes a medicine on their own initiative for an acute situation without medical advice.


In fact, there are 2 very different situations of self-medication

* Wild" self-medication: a patient who encounters an acute situation that he or she knows or thinks he or she recognises takes a medicine, usually from the family pharmacy, on his or her own initiative or on the advice of someone close to him or her, to deal with the situation.
* Controlled self-medication'', which consists of users treating their illnesses using duly authorised medicines known as self-medication medicines, with the advice of the dispensing pharmacist. These medicines have specific self-medication marketing authorisation issued by an ad hoc commission of the ANSM.
