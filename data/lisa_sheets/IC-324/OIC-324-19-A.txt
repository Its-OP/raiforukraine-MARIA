Taking into account the medicines most commonly self-medicated, we can assume that:

*Antibiotics can decapitate and mask the symptoms of an infection.
*NSAIDs expose patients to the risk of accumulating gastro-duodenal ulcers or the outbreak of an infection.
*Sedative drugs may pose a problem for driving.
*There is a risk of drug interaction with medicines taken officially.
*And finally, if unacknowledged, it may alter symptoms and lead to additional tests being prescribed without due consideration.
