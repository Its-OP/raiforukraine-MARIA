The practice of anaesthesia is governed by safety decrees included in the public health code.

In the event of a scheduled procedure requiring general or locoregional anaesthesia:

1. a ''pre-anaesthetic consultation'', carried out at least 2 days before a scheduled operation, valid for 1 month (unless anaesthetic advice is sought) ('''[[Pre-anaesthetic consultation SD-300|pre-anaesthetic consultation]]'''') ;

2. a "pre-anaesthetic visit" carried out within 24 hours prior to a scheduled operation;

3. the resources required to carry out the anaesthetic procedure;

4. continuous monitoring after the procedure ;

5. an organisation capable of dealing with complications arising from the operation or anaesthesia at any time.

The anaesthetic process as a whole is summarised in figure 1 ('''[[Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]]'''). The anaesthetic process is identical for both general and locoregional anaesthesia.

In the event of an emergency operation, the anaesthetic process is adapted to the degree of urgency of the situation.
