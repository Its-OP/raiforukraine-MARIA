Maternal-foetal infections are frequent (1 to 4% of births, all infections combined) and are 2 to 4 times more common in premature babies.

They may be due to

- Bacteria

o Group B Streptococcus: 1<sup>rst</sup> cause of early bacterial neonatal infection

o Escherichia coli: 2nd<sup>rst</sup> cause of early bacterial neonatal infection

o Listeriosis: 3rd<sup>rst</sup> cause of early neonatal bacterial infection

o Treponema pallidum (Syphilis)

- Parasites: toxoplasmosis (incidence: 1.5/1000 births)

- Viruses

o Cytomegalovirus (incidence: 1% of births; 1<sup>rst</sup> cause of non-genetic congenital deafness)

o Hepatitis B (exceptional in the case of sero-vaccination at birth)

o Zika virus

o Herpes simplex virus

o Chickenpox

o Rubella (incidence: 1/100,000 births)

o HIV (incidence < 1% when viral load is well controlled)

o Parvovirus B19

o SARS-CoV-2 (incidence: 3-5% of births after maternal infection)
