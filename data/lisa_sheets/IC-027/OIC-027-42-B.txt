Multidisciplinary care in a coordinated network. This network must bring together all the skills required to manage the pregnancy and welcome the child:

- general practitioner ;

- obstetrician, midwife ;

- paediatrician ;

- psychiatrist, psychologist ;

- addictologist ;

- tobacco midwife ;

- midwife and PMI nursery nurse;

- social worker.

It enables opiate substitution treatment to be introduced, withdrawal or a reduction in consumption depending on the substances concerned, and the pregnancy to be supported until term, minimising the medico-psycho-social complications for the child and the mother.

'''Opiate substitution treatments'''

- Opioid substitution treatments improve medical and obstetrical follow-up and reduce maternal and foetal morbidity and mortality.

- However, pregnancy remains a high-risk pregnancy (prematurity, hypotrophy, withdrawal syndrome).

- Two products can be used: methadone (Méthadone® in syrup or capsule form) and buprenorphine (generic Buprenorphine® or Subutex® in tablet form to be taken sublingually).

- Pending marketing authorisation, Suboxone®, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone also used as a substitution treatment, should be replaced as far as possible by Subutex® during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

- Treatment must be prescribed at an effective dose to maintain stable levels and avoid withdrawal in the mother-to-be and the foetus.

- The increase in circulating volume at the end of pregnancy is accompanied by an increased need for opiates and usually requires an increase in dosage.

- The severity of the withdrawal syndrome is not related to the dosage of substitution treatment.

All these points should be explained to the mother-to-be at the start of the pregnancy and reiterated during follow-up consultations.

Management of other addictions

There are a number of possible approaches when substitution treatment is not available:

- monitoring consumption: setting up a logbook to track consumption and record cravings, consumption, trigger events, etc. ;

- possible use of an anxiolytic ("alcohol drug", evening joint, etc.), giving preference to oxazepam (Séresta®), a benzodiazepine with an intermediate half-life;

- motivational interview.
