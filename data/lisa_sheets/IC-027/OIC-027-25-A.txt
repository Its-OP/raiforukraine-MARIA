The risk of respiratory complications and mortality is increased in pregnant women in the event of influenza.

'''Primary prevention'''

Flu vaccination is the best way for pregnant women to protect themselves. Only inactivated influenza vaccines can be used in pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy. Transplacental passage of maternal influenza antibodies confers protection on newborns and infants who cannot be vaccinated before the age of 6 months.

Hygiene measures (wearing masks, using hydroalcoholic solutions, limiting visits) to reduce transmission have proved effective. It is important to limit contact with other people, especially those at risk.

Hygiene measures

- Cover your mouth whenever you cough (mask)

- Cover your nose every time you sneeze

- Blow your nose into single-use tissues in a lidded bin, then wash your hands with SHA

- Spit only into a single-use paper handkerchief disposed of in a lidded bin, then SHA

- Wash your hands after each of these actions and regularly throughout the day

1. Clinical signs of a possible case of influenza (epidemic period): general signs (fever > 38°C or aches and pains or asthenia) + respiratory signs ([[Cough SD-167|cough]] or [[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]]).

2. Surroundings = people living in the same dwelling or in close contact with it (< 1 m).

3. Signs of seriousness: impairment of higher functions (confusion, impaired alertness, disorientation), respiratory rate > 30/min, PAS < 90 mmHg, HR > 120/min.

A nasal swab is taken for virological testing if there are any signs of seriousness or co-morbidities.

Curative antiviral treatment with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) is started as soon as possible, and at the latest within 48 hours of the first signs, regardless of the trimester of pregnancy and whether or not there are any serious risk factors, without waiting for the results of the biological diagnosis.

Treatment is stopped if the virological test is negative (RT-PCR).

Breast-feeding is still possible.
