Maternal measles is thought to be more serious during pregnancy, particularly because of the increased frequency of pneumonia and heart failure.

Rate of hospitalisation for pneumonia among pregnant women contracting measles = 30%.

'''Fetal consequences'''

Increased risk of miscarriage, foetal death 'in utero' and prematurity

No increase in the risk of congenital malformations

'''Neonatal consequences'''

Perinatal measles ("congenital" measles) = [[Rash in children SD-037|eruption]] occurring in a newborn within the first 10 days of life.

Increased risk if maternal infection occurs in the 3 weeks prior to birth.

Risk :

- Death (frequent)

- Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
