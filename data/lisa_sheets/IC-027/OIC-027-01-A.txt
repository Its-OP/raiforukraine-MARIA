Maternal-foetal infection is the result of contamination of the foetus during pregnancy or delivery by germs of maternal origin. It is also called early bacterial neonatal infection if bacterial.

Depending on the agent responsible and the stage of the pregnancy, MFIs can lead to :

- Miscarriages

- Embryopathies

- Foetal infections = foetopathies

- In utero or neonatal death

- Post-natal infections which may be symptomatic from the 1st day, or at a later date
