The flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, particularly those at risk (diabetics, obese women).

Vaccines available at any stage of pregnancy

- Inactivated vaccines: tetanus, diphtheria (reduced valency), hepatitis A and B, meningococcus, pneumococcus

- Live attenuated vaccines: yellow fever if travel to an endemic area cannot be postponed

Vaccines that are theoretically contraindicated during pregnancy are derived from live attenuated agents: measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella, BCG, rotavirus.

Vaccines whose safety during pregnancy has not been proven: cholera, typhoid (except if you are staying in a high-risk area).

The mRNA vaccines (COVID-19) are currently being evaluated in pregnant women.

Special case of whooping cough (inactivated vaccine) authorised in certain European countries but not yet in France: In the event of vaccination during pregnancy: reassure the patient.
