One per cent of pregnant women are infected with hepatitis B. Vertical transmission is mainly intra- and post-natal. Its frequency depends on viral replication, assessed by viral DNA testing.

Transmission does not depend on the mode of delivery (vaginal delivery or caesarean section). Infected newborns can develop hepatitis, with a 90% risk of becoming chronic, and a high risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

- In the event of a high viral load during pregnancy, antiviral treatment should be started.
