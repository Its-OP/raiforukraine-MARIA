Seroprevalence of varicella in pregnant women is estimated at 98.8%.

Vaccination against chickenpox is recommended (Vaccination calendar and vaccine recommendations 2021):

- Adolescents aged between 12 and 18 who have no clinical history of chickenpox or whose history is in doubt; a prior serological check may be carried out in this case;

- Women of childbearing age, particularly those planning a pregnancy and with no clinical history of chickenpox; a prior serological check may be carried out in this case. Vaccination must be preceded by a negative pregnancy test, and effective contraception for 3 months is recommended after each dose of vaccine;
