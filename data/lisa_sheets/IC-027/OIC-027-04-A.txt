Maternal-foetal transmission depends on the gestational age at infection. It increases as pregnancy progresses. It is very low in the periconceptional period (1% between 0 and 7 weeks' gestation; 6 to 10% up to 13 weeks' gestation), while in the 2nd trimester, maternal-foetal transmission is around 40%. In the 3rd trimester, it is 72%.

The severity of lesions decreases with gestational age:

- Severe embryopathy and foetopathy more frequent in the 1st trimester (61%);

- Foetopathies or sub-clinical forms (serological) in the 2nd trimester (25%) ;

- Pure serological forms (no foetal repercussions) in the 3rd trimester

In all, 70% of children infected "in utero" have a sub-clinical condition; 25% have a mild form, mainly ocular (chorioretinitis); less than 5% have a severe form with neurological manifestations (ventricular dilatation, hydrocephalus, etc.).
