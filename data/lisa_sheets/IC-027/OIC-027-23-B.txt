Treatment of bacterial vaginosis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis is based on oral metronidazole (1 g/d for 7 days or 2 g as a single dose). In view of the possibility of recurrence, it is recommended that the treatment be checked once every three months and repeated if necessary (HAS, 2001). As a matter of principle, any symptomatic bacterial vaginosis caused by Gardnerella vaginalis should be treated during pregnancy.
