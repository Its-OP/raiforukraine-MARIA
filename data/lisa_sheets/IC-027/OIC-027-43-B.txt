Neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NNDS) following in utero exposure to opiates affects around 60% of children born to mothers who used opiates or opiate substitution treatments during pregnancy.

The severity and duration of SSNN are not correlated with the dosage of opioid substitution treatment.

The severity and duration of the syndrome may be influenced by the concomitant use of other products, particularly benzodiazepines (a later and/or longer syndrome; use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy itself leads to an impregnation and then withdrawal syndrome at birth).

The symptoms are :

- neurovegetative: excitability, hypertonia, hyperreactivity, tremor, startle, high-pitched cry, restless sleep, sweating, hyperthermia ;

- respiratory: [[Rhinorrhea SD-155|rhinorrhea]], sneezing, yawning, respiratory rhythm disorders ;

- digestive: poor sucking, regurgitation, vomiting, diarrhoea.

'''Notify the SSNN'''

During pregnancy

- organise an ante-natal paediatric consultation to inform parents ;

- prepare them for the possibility of an SNS and its management: listen (guilt, worry), reassure, inform, stress the essential role of the mother through simple everyday gestures: breastfeeding, care, etc.

At birth

- encouraging and supporting mother-child bonding: breastfeeding, nursing care, rocking, skin-to-skin contact, swaddling, maintaining a peaceful, quiet atmosphere, soft lighting, etc;

- detect and assess withdrawal syndrome using the Finnegan score every 4 hours from birth;

- treat if necessary: if the score exceeds 8 on 3 consecutive assessments, initiate treatment with morphine hydrochloride or sulphate (gradual increase in dosage, maintain dosage for 48 hours until stabilised, then reduce in stages every 48 hours).
