Questioning is the key to screening. It should be intensified in the following clinical situations:

- history of FAS/malformative syndrome in the offspring (very high risk of recurrence);

- drug addiction (30-50% of patients on drug substitutes drink alcohol);

- context of domestic violence, sexual abuse ;

- psychiatric disorders, depression ;

- heavy smoking ;

- ultrasound findings of growth retardation or malformations.

It is important to adopt an empathetic attitude and a non-judgemental framework, preferring indirect and/or open-ended questions: "Before pregnancy, how many drinks did you have a day? And now?" or "Is it difficult for you not to drink alcohol now? A good method is to use validated self-questionnaires such as the T-ACE, which even seem to be more sensitive than questioning in detecting maternal alcohol consumption.
