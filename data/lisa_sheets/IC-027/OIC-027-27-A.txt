All pregnant women should have their rhesus group phenotype determined and irregular agglutinins (antibodies) tested (RAI) during the 1st trimester of pregnancy.

In RhD-negative women (Rh-) or women who have previously received blood transfusions, IATs will be prescribed again at the 6th, 8th or 9th month.

In the event of a positive IAT, the antibody must be identified and titrated. Identification is used to determine whether the antibody in question is a risk factor for foetal or neonatal complications (anti-D in particular, but also anti-Kell, anti-c, etc.). Titration and weight assay are used to assess the affinity and quantity of the antibody.
