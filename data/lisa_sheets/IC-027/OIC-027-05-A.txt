Pregnant women are monitored for toxoplasmosis by monthly [[Interpretation of a SD-236 serology result|serological screening]]: toxoplasmosis IgG and IgM testing is mandatory when pregnancy is declared (unless previous maternal immunity has been documented).

In non-immune women, serology should be repeated monthly until delivery, because of the high frequency of inapparent forms of maternal toxoplasmosis (80%).

The steps to be taken in the event of positive maternal serology are as follows.

1) Dating maternal contamination

- It's easy if it's a seroconversion during serological monitoring.

- If serology is positive with the presence of IgG and IgM in early pregnancy, the IgG avidity index should be used as a guide: a high value indicates a long-standing infection. A reference laboratory should also be called in to repeat all the maternal samples in order to assess how far the infection has progressed and when it occurred.

2) If seroconversion is confirmed during pregnancy, the patient should be referred to a Centre Pluridisciplinaire de Diagnostic Pr√©natal (CPDPN) for further treatment. Anti-parasitic treatment will be initiated as soon as seroconversion is diagnosed. Treatment may be modified if the amniotic fluid PCR is positive.
