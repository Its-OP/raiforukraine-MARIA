There are no biological tests necessary for diagnosis.

The CA19.9 marker is not a diagnostic tool, except in the specific case of the assessment of a pancreatic mass for which histology cannot be obtained (at least 1 negative biopsy taken under echo-endoscopy). In this situation, if the CA19.9 is greater than 10 times the upper normal value without associated cholestasis, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma may be accepted.

The pre-therapy biological work-up should include a CBC, blood ionogram, creatinine, liver work-up (transaminases, Ph alkalines, GGT) and nutritional work-up (albumin, pre-albumin).
