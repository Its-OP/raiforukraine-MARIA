The pancreas can be the site of several types of tumour depending on their appearance (solid or cystic), their origin (endocrine or exocrine) and whether they are benign or malignant.

'''Adenocarcinoma is the most common form'' (90%) of malignant tumours. It develops from ductal exocrine tissue. The second, much rarer type of tumour is represented by neuroendocrine tumours, whether non-secreting (the most common case) or secreting (insulin, glucagon, etc.). Other histological types (acinar cells, adenosquamous cells, etc.) are even rarer.
