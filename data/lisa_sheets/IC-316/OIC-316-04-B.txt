- Myelogram

* essential for diagnosis
* normal or increased marrow richness contrasting with peripheral cytopenias: this contrast reflects the inefficient nature of haematopoiesis
* morphological abnormalities affect one or more lineages: dysmyelopoiesis
* abnormalities of erythroblasts (dyserythropoiesis): various nuclear abnormalities, poorly haemoglobinised cytoplasms
* abnormalities in granulocyte precursors (dysgranulopoiesis): cytoplasm with poor granulation, poorly segmented mature neutrophils
* abnormalities in megakaryocytes (dysmegakaryopoiesis): reduced size, small nuclei
* sometimes an excess of blasts (immature cells) but always less than 20%.
* Perls staining (sideroblasts in a crown - these are not blasts !!!!)
* karyotype can be performed (diagnostic and prognostic element)

- bone marrow karyotype

* from bone marrow cells
* essential for prognosis
* sometimes aids diagnosis
* no karyotypic abnormality specific to myelodysplastic syndromes
* normal in 50% of cases
* structural abnormalities (balanced translocations): rare, unlike acute leukaemias.
* frequent number abnormalities (monosomy, trisomy)
* the most frequent anomalies: deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, or del(5q), monosomy 7 and trisomy 8.

These abnormalities are acquired and are present only in haematopoietic cells (except in exceptional cases of underlying constitutional disease, these abnormalities are therefore present only in disease cells).

- '''Classification of MDS (WHO)''''

It is based on :

- morphological abnormalities in one or more bone marrow lineages

- the percentage of blasts in blood and bone marrow

- the presence of "crown" sideroblasts

- Karyotype (for 5q minus syndrome)


It comprises several categories

- MDS with unilineage dysplasia or with multilineage dysplasia when one or more cytopenias are present

- MDS with crown sideroblasts when "crown" sideroblasts are found in the bone marrow (> 15%)

- MDS with excess blasts when there is an excess of blasts in the bone marrow (>4% but less than 20%) with or without the presence of a limited percentage of circulating blasts

- myelodysplastic syndromes with del(5q) (or "5q- syndrome")

- chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia when monocytosis is > 1 G/L
