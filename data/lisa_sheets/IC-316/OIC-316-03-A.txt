= <small>1.   Discovery</small> =
- Often incidental, on a blood count

- If signs suggestive of cytopenias appear (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)

- Anaemia is present in 80% of cases

- Rarer: haemorrhagic symptoms associated with thrombocytopenia (with or without thrombopathy, as there is a quantitative and qualitative defect in production), or an infectious condition associated with neutropenia (see febrile neutropenia).

= <small>2.     Clinical examination</small> =
- Generally normal

- Signs associated with bone marrow failure: anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, etc.

- No tumour syndrome: except for borderline forms between myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative syndrome where splenomegaly may be observed (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia - CMML).

= <small>3.   Blood count</small> =


- '''Anemia'''

o almost constant (80%)

o Normochrome

o usually macrocytic (sometimes normocytic)

o non-regenerative

- '''Thrombocytopenia'''

o Often moderate

o More marked in severe forms (high-risk)

o A normal or increased platelet count does not exclude myelodysplastic syndrome.

o Sometimes associated with thrombopathy (qualitative abnormality)

- '''Leukocytes'''

o Normal or decreased counts associated with neutropenia (< 1.5 G/L).

o Sometimes monocytes greater than 1 G/l: suggestive of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML),

o Morphological abnormality of leukocytes on blood smear (degranulated neutrophils or neutrophils with poorly segmented nuclei)

o Circulating blasts: between 0 and 19%.
