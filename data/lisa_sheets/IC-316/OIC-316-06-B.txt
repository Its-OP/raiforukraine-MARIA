=<1.   Elements of prognosis</small>=
IPSS and IPSS-R prognostic scores are based on:

- the number and depth of cytopenias

- karyotype results

- The % of medullary blasts

Defines "low-risk" MDS (prolonged survival and low risk of progression to AML) and "high-risk" MDS (short survival and high risk of transformation to AML)<br />.

=<2.   Complications</small>=
- Related to bone marrow failure

o anaemia

o Bleeding thrombocytopenia (causes 15% of deaths)

o febrile neutropenia

- Linked to disease progression

o low-risk to high-risk MDS

o from MDS to AML: risk of transformation of 30% in general, but +++ in high-risk MDS

- Linked to iron overload

o as a result of ineffective haematopoiesis

o transfusions (and other complications of transfusions)

- Linked to treatment<br />.

=<3.   Therapeutic concepts</small>=
- Low-risk MDS

o Objective: combat cytopenias

o Means: transfusion, EPO

- High-risk MDS

o Objective: improve survival

o Means: hypomethylating agents, chemotherapy for AML (sometimes), allograft (the only curative treatment, but reserved for the youngest patients).
