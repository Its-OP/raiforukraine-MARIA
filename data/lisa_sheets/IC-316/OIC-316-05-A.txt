'''Differential diagnoses (tests to suggest them):'''

*Medullary aplasia (poor marrow on myelogram, BOM will help make the diagnosis)
*deficiency anaemia (vitamin B9, vitamin B12) (serum levels of vitamins B9 and B12)
*Bone marrow infiltration by another haematological malignancy or solid tumour metastasis (myelogram and/or BOM).
*Acute leukaemia (>19% blasts) (seen on myelogram)
*Myelofibrosis (poor marrow on myelogram, BOM will enable diagnosis)
*Any other cause of central anaemia (see dedicated question).
