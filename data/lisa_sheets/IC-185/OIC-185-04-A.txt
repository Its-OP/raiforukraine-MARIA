The main biological markers of an inflammatory syndrome are

* Proteins from the acute phase of inflammation, whose synthesis and serum levels increase:

           C-reactive protein

           -Fibrinogen

           -Serum Amyloid A

           -Orosomucoid

           -Haptoglobin, ceruleoplasmin

           -Alpha 1 anti-trypsin, alpha 1 chymotrypsin

-Alpha 2 macroglobulin

           - C3 and C4 fractions of the complement

           -Ferritin

* Hepatic proteins whose synthesis is decreasing:

           -Albumin

           -Transferrin

* Other proteins of non-hepatic origin have an increased synthesis:

-Procalcitonin: fairly specific for inflammatory syndromes, mainly of bacterial infectious origin, useful for the diagnosis/prognosis of sepsis.
