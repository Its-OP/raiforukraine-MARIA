'''1- Serum protein electrophoresis:''''

The hyper-alpha1 and 2-globulinaemia shows an inflammatory syndrome.

Electrophoresis can also identify hypergammaglobulinaemia. <gallery>

</gallery>'''2- The sedimentation rate (VS) of red blood cells:'''

-Simple, sensitive and inexpensive method of detecting inflammatory syndrome, but not very specific.

-The SV varies with age and sex. Normal values are :

Age (year)/2 in men, with mean values of 15 mm before age 50 and 20 mm after age 50

Age (year) + 10/2 in women, with mean values of 20 mm before age 50 and 30 mm after age 50


'''3- Blood count (CBC):''''

it shows

normocytic, normochromic anaemia'', non-regenerative

Neutrophil hyperleukocytosis, which is very rare.

Hyperplateletosis


4- '''Direct assay of proteins from the acute phase of inflammation:''''

Fast, inexpensive and specific. A good inflammatory protein in clinical practice is one with a high level of variation, rapid kinetics and simple, reproducible assay.

We generally combine the assay of 2 proteins with a high degree of variation and different kinetics, for example C-reactive protein and fibrinogen.
