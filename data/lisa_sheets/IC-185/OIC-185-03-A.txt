'''A- FUNCTIONAL SIGNS:''''

The general signs correspond to what is often referred to as "flu-like syndrome".

'''1- La Fi√®vre:'''

'''2- Anorexia and weight loss:'''

'''3- Asthenia and drowsiness:''''

'''4- Pain:''''

It will often help to direct the clinician towards the organ that is being attacked and the site of the IR. Inflammatory joint pain, for example, is nocturnal, at rest, with morning stiffness and rousing.


'''B- PHYSICAL SIGNS:''''

The classic signs of acute localised IR are ''redness, heat, swelling and pain'', which reflect the different phases of IR. These signs are only visible if the organs are superficial.

Sino depends on the type and location of the attack.

In the case of diffuse IR, signs of shock with collapse may be observed.
