The proteins of the acute phase of inflammation have increased synthesis and serum levels:

* C-reactive protein
* Fibrinogen
* Serum Amyloid A
* Orosomucoid
* Haptoglobin, cerulea eoplasmin
* Alpha 1 anti-trypsin, alpha 1 chymotrypsin
* Alpha 2 macroglobulin
* C3 and C4 fractions of complement
* Ferritin

          



          

The intensity of variation is variable: concentrations multiplied by 1.5 (ceruleoplasmin, C3, C4), by 3 (orosomucoid, alpha-1 anti-trypsin, haptoglobin, alpha-1 anti-chymotrypsin, fibrinogen), by 500 (C-reactive protein or CRP, serum amyloid A protein or SAA).
