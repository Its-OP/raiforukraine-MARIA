The enthesis is the zone where various fibrous structures are anchored in the bone.

Inflammatory involvement of the entheses (or enthesitis), whether axial or peripheral, is the basic lesion of spondyloarthritis, as opposed to rheumatoid arthritis where the main involvement is synovitis.

Enthesitis results in local inflammatory pain, which is sometimes visible (Achilles enthesitis).
