'''General principles'''

Co-ordination of therapeutic management of patients by the rheumatologist, monitored jointly with the general practitioner. Information on therapeutic management, with particular emphasis on the risk/benefit ratio and the importance of compliance with drug treatment ([[Follow-up consultation for a chronic pathology SD-279]] ; [[Follow-up of immunosuppressed patients SD-291]] ; [Identifying the consequences of a disease/situation on job retention SD-316]]; Prevention of cardiovascular disease SD-320]]; Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328]]; Assessment of compliance with treatment SD-354]).

'''. Education and information''' (352. Explaining treatment to the patient (adult/child/adolescent))

'''. Drug treatment'''

- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with possible rotation of NSAIDs

- Analgesics, avoiding the use of opioids (250. Prescribing analgesics)

'''. Local treatments:''' in the case of arthritis (corticosteroid infiltration, isotopic synoviorthesis) or enthesopathy (cortisone infiltration).

'''. Treatments known as "background treatments (Table 1)" (=DMARD: Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug)''''
[File:Table 1. Disease-modifying treatments with MA.png|vignette|'''Table 1. Disease-modifying therapies with marketing authorisation according to spondyloarthritis phenotype. CsDMARDs = conventional synthetic DMARDs, tsDMARDs = targeted synthetic DMARDs, bDMARDs = Biologic DMARDs''']]
- '''Peripheral form:'''

CsDMARDs: Methotrexate, Leflunomide

bDMARDs: anti-TNF, anti-IL-17, anti-IL-23

- '''Axial form:'''

bDMARDs: anti-TNF, anti-IL-17

'''. Non-pharmacological treatments'''

- stopping smoking, regular physical activity (324. Therapeutic lifestyle changes (sleep, physical activity, diet, etc.)

- physiotherapy :

* Objectives: to reduce the risk of axial and peripheral ankylosis, i.e. loss of lumbar lordosis, increased dorsal kyphosis and cervical anteprojection, knee and hip flaccidity, and to maintain exercise capacity and function.
* Means : Maintenance of joint amplitudes of the spine, thoracic cage and lower limbs, in active, assisted active and passive (postures). Exercise training. Self-rehabilitation +++

- corset fitting only if spinal deformity is progressive.

'''. Surgery: '''' prosthetic joint replacement (coxitis), rarely spinal osteotomy to correct major dorsal kyphosis.

'''. Social cover: '''' 100% cover (ALD) for severe or disabling forms.
