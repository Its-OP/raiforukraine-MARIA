These diseases are included in the concept of spondyloarthritis. Patients with these diseases can also be classified using the ASAS criteria as axial or peripheral spondyloarthritis, depending on their clinico-radiological presentation.

'''. Ankylosing spondylitis (= radiographic axial spondyloarthritis): ''' the most typical form, characterised by damage to the axial skeleton (rachis and sacroiliac joints) which can lead to ankylosis.

'''. Psoriatic arthritis''''

'''. Reactive arthritis:''' Reactive arthritis is aseptic arthritis occurring a few weeks after a genital or digestive infection. Fiessinger-Leroy-Reiter syndrome is the most complete form of reactive arthritis and is defined by the triad urethritis-conjunctivitis-arthritis.

'''. Chronic inflammatory enterocolopathies:'''' Peripheral arthritis and/or radiological sacroiliitis occur in 10-20% of cases of Crohn's disease and haemorrhagic rectocolitis.
