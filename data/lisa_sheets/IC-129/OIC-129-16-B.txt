It is essential to assess the impact of pain and functional discomfort in all osteoarthritis patients.

We will assess :

- Pain intensity using the visual analogue or digital scale

- The presence of stiffness on clinical examination (limitation of amplitude)

- The presence of a knee effusion or synovitis in the hands, which is a poor prognostic factor

- Walking, in the case of lower limb damage, with a search for limping and quantification of the walking perimeter.

- Functional discomfort can also be quantified using algofunctional indices specific to each location: Lequesne index for gonarthrosis and/or coxarthrosis, WOMAC index for gonarthrosis and/or coxarthrosis, KOOS score for gonarthrosis, etc.

- Radiographic damage may also be considered. However, it is not a prognostic factor in itself, as symptoms are imperfectly correlated with those of radiographic damage in osteoarthritis.
