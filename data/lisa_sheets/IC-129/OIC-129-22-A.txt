Omarthrosis is osteoarthritis of the scapulohumeral joint.

Clinical features: chronic mechanical shoulder pain, secondary stiffness with limited range of movement.

X-ray: a front and side view of the shoulders (bilateral and comparative examination) and internal and external rotations of the shoulder (looking for calcifications at the insertion of the cuff tendons, a sign of tendinopathy, another differential diagnosis of pain).

There are two types of omarthrosis:

- O''eccentric marthrosis'', defined by the presence of an ascent of the humeral head which is no longer in front of the scapular glenoid. It is secondary to a rupture of the rotator cuff tendons.

- O''centric marthrosis'', without ascension of the humeral head. Rarer than the eccentric form, it should be investigated for an underlying destructive joint pathology such as rheumatoid arthritis or chondrocalcinosis.
