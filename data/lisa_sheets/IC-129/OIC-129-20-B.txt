Causes of secondary gonarthrosis :

- chronic arthritis: rheumatoid arthritis, peripheral spondyloarthritis, septic arthritis, microcrystalline arthropathy,

- advanced osteonecrosis,

- Paget's disease.

Etiologies that can lead to secondary coxarthrosis :

- Various congenital malformations such as luxating dysplasia or internal dysplasia.

- Fractures of the acetabulum or acetabular roof.

- Advanced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

- Advanced coxitis secondary to any destructive joint disease (mainly spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, microcrystalline arthritis, septic arthritis).

- Paget's disease (Paget's coxopathy)

- Inequality of the lower limbs when it exceeds 3 cm.

The clinical context and a standard X-ray (typically showing a global joint narrowing of the joint space) are generally sufficient to suggest a diagnosis of secondary osteoarthritis.
