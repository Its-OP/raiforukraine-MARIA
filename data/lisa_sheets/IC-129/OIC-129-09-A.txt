Osteoarthritis is diagnosed clinically. However, a standard X-ray can confirm the diagnosis by the presence of bone and joint abnormalities on the medical imaging examination.

The prescription of other complementary examinations must be reasoned. Apart from a standard X-ray, no other biological or imaging tests are necessary, except in cases of diagnostic doubt to investigate differential diagnoses.

Imaging should always be bilateral and comparative+++.

The request for an imaging examination will be, depending on the location :

- Hip: front standing pelvis shot and each hip loaded from the front + Lequesne false profile.

- Knee: 4 images: loaded images with bipodal support from the front (zero rotation, knees in extension), from the side, a patellofemoral pathway at 60° of flexion, an anteroposterior "schuss" view.

- Hands: frontal X-rays of the hands.
