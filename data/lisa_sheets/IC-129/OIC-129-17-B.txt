No biological examination is necessary for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

In the event of knee effusion or rapid destructive coxarthrosis, joint fluid will be punctured for analysis to rule out differential diagnoses.

The fluid will then be mechanical, often < 1,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, sterile, without microcrystals.
