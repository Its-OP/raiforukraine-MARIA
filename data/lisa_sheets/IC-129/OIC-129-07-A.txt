The diagnosis of osteoarthritis should be made when :

- Compatible background: age > 40, risk factors such as overweight or obesity.

- Chronic joint pain, mechanical in nature, [[pain in a limb (upper or lower)]] and more particularly the knee, hip (typical groin pain) or hands.

- Associated signs to look for: [[joint stiffness]], [[joint deformity]], for osteoarthritis of the lower limbs: repercussions with limping, onset of difficulty walking

- No argument for another diagnosis

|-
|Coxarthrosis
| Groin pain, anterior or anteromedial or even posterior

- Key sign (painful hip roll)

- Stiffness, difficulty squatting, limitation of walking perimeter

- Ducking lameness and/or lameness due to loss of hind step

- Vicious flaccid posture and external rotation in advanced forms
|-
|Femorotibial gonarthrosis
|<Knee pain, cracking</nowiki>.

- Reproduced pain on palpation of the medial or lateral joint space, cracking sound

- Possible static disorder (genu valgum or varum)

- Deformity with bone hypertrophy

- Possible effusion (patellar shock, float sign)

- Stiffness in flexion/extension, limitation of walking perimeter

- Lameness (advanced gonarthrosis)
|-
|Femoropatellar gonarthrosis
| Pain in the anterior aspect of the knee when walking and/or descending stairs, after prolonged sitting.

- Reproduced pain: on counter-extension of the leg; on pressure of the patella on the bent knee; on palpation of the patella; on the "plane manoeuvre" (pain triggered by rubbing the patella against the trochlea); on the Zohlen manoeuvre (pain when the examiner opposes the ascent of the patella during contraction of the quadriceps).

- Effusion (patellar shock, float sign)

- Stiffness in flexion/extension, limitation of walking perimeter

- Lameness (advanced gonarthrosis)<br />
