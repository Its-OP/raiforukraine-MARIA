Erosive digital osteoarthritis: a particular form of osteoarthritis which is particularly severe, destructive and deforming.

Secondary coxarthrosis: In the case of coxarthrosis, standard radiography is also used to look for an underlying architectural abnormality, such as dysplasia (coxometry).

Rapid destructive form: in rare cases, mainly in the hip and knee, osteoarthritis may progress very rapidly, with pinching taking place within a few weeks or months. This is known as rapid destructive osteoarthritis (differential diagnosis: microcrystalline or septic arthritis).
