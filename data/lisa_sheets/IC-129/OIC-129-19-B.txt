Erosive osteoarthritis of the fingers is a destructive form of osteoarthritis defined by the presence of erosion on X-rays of the hands.

Clinically it is a more severe form with :

- intense, mixed (mechanical + inflammatory), chronic pain.

- synovitis of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints

- greater functional discomfort than the non-erosive form

X-rays of the front of the hands confirm the erosive and destructive damage, with geodes and total pinching of the joint space with a "gull-wing" appearance. Destruction or collapse of the subchondral bone plate is equivalent to erosion.

In the most inflammatory forms, these conditions can resemble inflammatory rheumatism, particularly psoriatic arthritis, given the location of the distal interphalangeal joints.
