The most common form of peripheral osteoarthritis (non-spinal) is gonarthrosis, which causes pain in around 10% of the population. Coxarthrosis occurs in 50% of cases in an architectural defect (dysplasia) and affects 1 to 5% of the population. Digital osteoarthritis is also very common and predominates in the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints.
