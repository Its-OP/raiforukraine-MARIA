==Endometriosis==
Endometriosis is a benign, frequent and heterogeneous gynaecological pathology characterised by the presence of glands or endometrial stroma in an ectopic position, i.e. outside the uterine cavity.

From an anatomical point of view, lesions are classified into three categories which may co-exist:

- '''''Superficial peritoneal endometriosis''''' which corresponds to the presence of implants located on the surface of the peritoneum;

'''''- The endometrioma''''' corresponds to the ovarian location of endometriosis, resulting in the presence of an endometriotic ovarian cyst;

'''''- Deep pelvic endometriosis''''' (or subperitoneal endometriosis) corresponding to lesions which infiltrate more than 5 mm below the surface of the peritoneum.  This definition concerns situations where the lesions affect the muscularis propria of the abdomino-pelvic organs, which may involve the anterior compartment (bladder, ureters) or posterior compartment (torus, utero-sacral ligaments, posterior vaginal cul de sac, anterior wall of the rectum and/or sigmoid). Deep endometriosis lesions are often multifocal.

Other, rarer locations may exist, notably involving the diaphragm, pleura, umbilicus or abdominal muscular wall.

==Adenomyosis==
Endometriosis may also be associated with adenomyosis. Although there is no agreed anatomical or histological classification of adenomyosis, a distinction is classically made between

- Diffuse internal adenomyosis characterised by the presence of numerous foci of glands and/or endometrial stroma throughout the myometrium.

- External focal adenomyosis, which corresponds to the presence of endometrial aggregates confined to specific areas of the myometrium.

==Dysmenorrhoea==
'''Dysmenorrhoea''' is a frequently revealing symptom of endometriosis or adenomyosis.

They are defined by cyclical [[Pelvic pain SD-099|abdominopelvic pain]], punctuated by menstruation, occurring just before the start of the period, usually lasting a day or two, sometimes until after the period, and then increasing in intensity.

A distinction must be made between primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea.

===Primary dysmenorrhoea===
'''Primary (or essential) dysmenorrhoea''' classically appear 6 to 24 months after the first menstrual period (when cycles become ovulatory), are characterised by isolated pelvic or lumbar cramp-like pain, sometimes associated with other symptoms ([[Nausea SD-012|nausea]], [[Vomiting SD-013|vomiting]] Diarrhoea SD-002|diarrhoea]], [[Headache SD-118|migraines]], vagal malaise), are of moderate to severe intensity and respond to the usual analgesic treatments (antispasmodics, paracetamol, NSAIDs).

===Secondary dysmenorrhoea===
Secondary (or organic) dysmenorrhoea'' is less typical, occurring during and outside menstruation, of severe intensity (VAS>7/10), worsening with each cycle, accompanied by other painful symptoms resistant to the usual analgesics.
