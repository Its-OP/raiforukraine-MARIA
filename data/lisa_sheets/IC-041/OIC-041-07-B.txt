The management of endometriosis must be comprehensive and multi-disciplinary, including the treatment of pain and the management of any infertility.

Medical treatments should be prescribed as a first-line treatment, on an empirical basis, for any suspected endometriosis, without the need for prior histological proof.

=== Non-hormonal treatment ===
Pain relief 1 2C-135-PC-A05|Treatment analgesics]'' (Anti-spasmodics, Paracetamol, NSAIDs) should be considered in view of the painful nature of the disease. Long-term prescription of NSAIDs should be avoided because of the significant gastric and renal side-effects.

Treatment in a "pain centre" is sometimes necessary when the pain is chronic and resistant to the usual analgesic treatments.

Acupuncture, osteopathy and yoga are non-medicinal treatments that have been shown to improve quality of life and can be offered in addition to medical treatment.

=== Hormonal treatments ===
Given the hormonal dependence of endometriosis, hormonal treatments, and in particular the various [[Contraception|contraceptions]], are among the first-line therapies proposed. Their mechanism of action is multiple: reduction or suppression of menstrual flow, inhibition of ovulation for certain treatments, atrophic action on endometrial tissue, restoration of progesterone sensitivity, reduction in prostaglandin synthesis, reduction in cell proliferation, neuro-angiogenesis and oxidative stress.

To be effective against pain, amenorrhoea must be induced. Bleeding is always associated with a recurrence of pain.

These treatments have a suspensive effect on all the painful symptoms, but have no curative effect on the endometriotic disease, and are not compatible with a desire to become pregnant.

==== The first-line hormonal treatments are ====
combined oestroprogestogenic contraception (discontinuous or continuous in the case of dysmenorrhoea) and the levonorgestrel intrauterine device. The choice of these treatments should be guided by any contraindications, potential side-effects, previous treatments and the patient's opinion.

==== Second-line hormonal treatments are ====
oral microprogestogen contraception with desogestrel, etonogestrel implants, dienogest, pregnane and norpregnane progestogens (in accordance with the monitoring and prescribing recommendations issued by ANSM), GnRH analogues in combination with add-back therapy.

This is a long treatment, often continued either until the desire for pregnancy or until the menopause.

=== Surgical treatment ===
The indication for surgery allows diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic evaluation of the disease. Laparoscopy is preferred to laparotomy.

The choice of surgical treatment is guided by: the lack of efficacy of medical treatments for pain, intolerance to the various medical treatments that have been well administered, and the patient's expectations. In the event of infertility, a discussion will take place between IVF, which is possible even in the case of endometriomas, and surgery.

Surgical treatment of endometriosis can be complex in the case of digestive or bladder involvement, and must be carried out in a referral centre by multi-disciplinary surgical teams. This is because a single operation is the key to therapeutic success. Recurrences are possible and are best treated medically. In order to be as effective as possible, surgical treatment must be considered in its most complete form, so as not to leave lesions in place that could recur. Endometriomas can respond to medical treatment and do not systematically constitute an indication for surgery, which must be limited in order to preserve the ovarian reserve.

=== Medical assistance for procreation ===
[Medically assisted procreation: main biological, medical and ethical aspects|Medically assisted procreation (MAP) can be considered in cases of infertility.

It will be proposed after a full infertility assessment has been carried out on the couple, and the type of MAP will be guided by the results of the complementary examinations, the stage of the endometriosis, the patient's age and the period of infertility.

In cases of ovarian endometriosis or impaired ovarian reserve, fertility preservation may be considered.
