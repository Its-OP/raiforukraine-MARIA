===First-line paraclinical examinations for the diagnosis of endometriosis===
- Endo-vaginal pelvic ultrasound

- Pelvic MRI

These examinations, which must be carried out by ultrasound examiners and/or referring radiologists

They should be carried out on all patients presenting with pelvic pain

====Proceedings====

*the size of the lesions
*the anatomical location of the endometriosis visible on imaging.
*Ureteral locations, which are uncommon but may have renal repercussions, are often discovered during imaging (dilated ureter/pyelocaval cavities).

===Ovarian involvement===
With regard to ovarian involvement, the data in the literature show that endo-vaginal pelvic ultrasound and pelvic MRI have similar performances for the diagnosis of endometrioma.

In the event of a positive diagnosis of endometrioma, a systematic search must be made for associated deep endometriosis.

=== Subperitoneal involvement ===
Pelvic MRI is more sensitive but less specific than endovaginal ultrasound for diagnosing utero-sacral ligaments, the vagina and the recto-vaginal septum.

Pelvic ultrasound and MRI are complementary for analysing damage to the anterior wall of the recto-sigmoid and bladder.
