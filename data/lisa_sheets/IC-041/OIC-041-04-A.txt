Histological evidence during systematic diagnostic laparoscopy is not necessary to make the diagnosis of endometriosis. This is based on a range of clinical and para-clinical arguments.

However, it can be difficult because of the heterogeneity of the disease and the pauci- or asymptomatic forms.

== Examination ==
The questioning must be precise in order to look for all the "painful symptoms" suggestive of endometriosis and to assess the intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS):

- Dysmenorrhoea'' occurring during and outside menstruation, of severe intensity (VAS>7/10), worsening with each cycle, accompanied by other painful symptoms resistant to the usual analgesics.

- '''Deep [[Normal sexuality and its disorders|dyspareunia]]''' resulting in deep pain during sexual intercourse.

- '''Functional digestive catamenial signs (dyschezia)''' essentially pain on defecation and/or transit problems.

- Catamenial urinary signs such as pollakiuria, urgency or bladder pain.

- '''The [[Pelvic pain SD-099|chronic pelvic pain]]''' which are independent of the cycle<ins>, responsible for physical and/or psychological exhaustion which should be investigated on questioning.</ins><s>.</s>

- '''In the case of adenomyosis,''' there may be bleeding in the form of [[Menstrual Cycle Disorders SD-094|meno or metrorrhagia]] always painful''''''.

== Clinical gynaecological examination ==
The '''gynaecological clinical examination''' should look for :

- the existence of ''bluish lesions'' in the vagina on speculum examination,

- palpation of nodules in the uterosacral ligaments or the cul-de-sac of Douglas, pain when the uterosacral ligaments are tightened, and a retroverted uterus that is difficult to mobilise by vaginal touch.

- an enlarged ovary.

- in the presence of adenomyosis, especially during the menstrual period, the uterus is enlarged and sensitive to mobilisation.

However, clinical examination is not always conclusive and a normal examination does not rule out the diagnosis.
