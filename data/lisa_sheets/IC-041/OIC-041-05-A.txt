The ''two main consequences'' of endometriosis are painful symptoms and infertility.

=== Painful symptoms ===
The symptoms of pain vary from one woman to another. Pain can be acute and cyclical or chronic. Furthermore, there is no systematic or absolute link between the extent of the endometriosis, its deep or superficial nature and the clinical symptoms (there is no anatomo-clinical parallelism). However, the type of pain is correlated with the location of the lesions. Finally, some patients are asymptomatic and the diagnosis of endometriosis may be fortuitous, following pelvic imaging.

=== Infertility ===
L''''i[[Couple's infertility: conduct of the first consultation|infertility]]'' is a frequent circumstance in the diagnosis of the condition.

Although endometriosis is not synonymous with infertility, the proportion of infertile endometriosis patients is estimated at between 30% and 50%.

In this context of endometriosis, several non-exclusive mechanisms are responsible for [[Difficulty in procreating SD-033|difficulties in procreating]]: a pelvic factor, linked to inflammation, disrupting fertilisation; an ovarian factor, linked to oocyte quality and/or quantity; a uterine factor disrupting implantation, a tubal location altering tubal permeability.
