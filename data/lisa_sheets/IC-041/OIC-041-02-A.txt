== Endometriosis
The peak frequency is around the age of 40 but is probably earlier, the average time taken to diagnose endometriosis being estimated at between 3 and 10 years after the onset of the first symptoms.

Endometriosis has a real impact on quality of life. The economic impact of endometriosis (direct and indirect costs generated by its treatment) is significant.

=== Prevalence ===
The prevalence and incidence of endometriosis in the general population are difficult to assess, given the presence of asymptomatic forms and the polymorphism of clinical presentations.

An annual incidence of around 0.1% has been reported in women aged between 15 and 49.

The prevalence of endometriosis is thought to be between 6 and 10% of women of childbearing age, varying considerably depending on the population studied.

==== - in women with chronic pelvic pain ====
It varies between 2% and 74% depending on the study, and these studies remain heterogeneous.

==== - in women with acute pelvic pain ====
the prevalence would be higher, at 33%.

==== - in teenagers ====
The disease appears to be more common in teenagers suffering from chronic pelvic pain resistant to the usual analgesics, and in 70% of teenagers with dysmenorrhoea.

==== - in infertile women ====
As part of the investigation of [[Infertility of the couple: conduct of the first consultation|primary infertility]], endometriosis is found in 20 to 50% of cases.

=== Adenomyosis ===
The prevalence of adenomyosis is difficult to estimate because of the different diagnostic methods (imaging or histology) and the existence of asymptomatic forms.  

Data from series of patients treated by hysterectomy show a prevalence of adenomyosis of the order of 20 to 30%, with a wide variation in this estimate ranging from 5 to 70%. The prevalence in series where the diagnosis is made by imaging is around 20 to 30%.
