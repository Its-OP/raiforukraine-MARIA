'''Torsion disorder''' (abnormality of rotation in the transverse axis): excessive internal rotation in young children ("foot in" physiological up to 7 years), excessive external rotation in older children. Most often progresses favourably with growth. No orthopaedic treatment. Surgery is exceptional

'''Genu varum''' (anomaly of rotation in the frontal axis): intercondylar spacing, physiological up to 3 years of age

''Genu valgum'' (anomaly of rotation in the frontal axis): intermaleolar spacing, physiological from 3 to 10 years of age, disappears at puberty.
