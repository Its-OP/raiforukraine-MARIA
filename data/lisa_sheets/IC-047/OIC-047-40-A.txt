Mortality and morbidity in children, and more generally in children and adolescents, are a reflection of the overall state of health of a population.

Infant mortality in 2019 = 3.6 per 1,000 live births, a rising trend in recent years whereas it is falling in other European countries ([[Prevention of unexplained infant death SD-318]])
