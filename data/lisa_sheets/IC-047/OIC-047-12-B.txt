* At all ages:
** external examination: face and neck, pinna, ear canal
** otoscopy
* New-born babies (objective tests):''' induced acoustic emissions (OEAP) or automated auditory evoked potentials. AEO may miss hearing loss due to auditory neuropathy (false negative).
* Outside the neonatal period (subjective tests except tympanometry): child calm and quiet, reassurance.
** Calibrated sound sources (Moatti box, sensory baby test): behavioural reaction to sound stimulation, acutropic reflex (from 6 months, turns head towards object) or investigative orientation. The younger the child, the greater the intensity of sound required to obtain a response. Clear responses at 70 dB = no bilateral deafness in infants.
** Voice test: response to first name (after 6 months), familiar words, picture book (after 2 years), voice audiometry (after 4 years).
** Headphone tonal audiometry if the child cooperates and understands (after 4 years).
** Tympanometry: tubal obstruction or serous otitis.
