*At any age: external examination of the eye (eyelids, size and symmetry of the eyeballs, conjunctiva, cornea, iris (coloboma), pupils (leucocoria), etc.).
*1st weeks of life: examination using an ophthalmoscope or otoscope (coaxial light and orifice, non-glare light and observation from a distance of 30 to 50 cm).
**photomotor reflexes: organic cause
**pupillary glare: leukocoria (see photo) (= EMERGENCY) retinal anomaly (retinoblastoma) or corneal anomaly (cataract)
**Corneal reflections: strabismus (see photo)

*2 to 4 months:
**Monocular and binocular fixation with a light source or high-contrast object, fixation must be centred (reflection in the centre of the pupil), stable (no nystagmus) and maintained.
**Ocular pursuit: with "bull's eye" (concentric black and white target), before the age of 2 months, movements are imperfectly coordinated; from 4 months, pursuit without head or body movement. May trigger nystagmus (ophthalmological opinion), if no pursuit = ophthalmological opinion to rule out bilateral amblyopia.
*9 to 15 months: look for amblyopia
**alternating occlusion to look for a defence reaction (the infant "defends" itself when the healthy eye is hidden from it)
**spinning top sign: an object is moved to the right and left of the infant, if the amblyopic infant turns its head towards the "sick" side. Also used to test eye mobility
**stereoscopic tests (relief vision): Lang test = dots on a plate depicting an object which the child tries to grasp if his stereoscopic vision is correct.
*After 2 1/2 years: near and distance visual acuity.
**Object matching method (child points to or names the designated object): search for a refraction problem (Pigassou, Cadet or Rossano Weiss test).
*After the age of 4
**Directional tests: e.g. Snellen's E-tests (capital E's of different sizes and with different orientations, the child indicates the orientation of the branches of the E either with an E-shaped object or with his hand (up, down, right, left)).
**Number and letter tests (Cadet, Monoyer Scale)
**Examination of colour vision: Babydalton or Ischihara tests. Colour vision should be assessed at least once on entering school [[Fichier:Pigassou.png|néant|vignette|Test de Pigassou]]
