Sugar consumption promotes tooth decay

Prevention is based on

* good oral and dental hygiene: brushing 2 times a day from the first teeth, with fluoride toothpaste depending on age
* avoid nibbling between meals or taking a sugary bottle to sleep ("bottle syndrome")
* regular dental check-ups, with annual visits to the dentist from the age of 12-18 months
* if there is a high risk of caries (history, lifestyle habits, difficulty brushing due to disability, for example)
** fluoride per os
** Sealing of grooves
