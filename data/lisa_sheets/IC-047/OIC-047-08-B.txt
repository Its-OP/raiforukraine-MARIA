- The visual system

* is immature at birth
* anatomical and functional development until the age of 10.

- Consequences of a developmental disorder = weaker vision resulting in poor visual acuity due to non-use of the eye

- Visual acuity: ability to distinguish details separated by a small angle in the line of sight, ability to distinguish distinct points in maximum contrast (black on a white background, for example).

- Vision stage

ยง progressive increase in visual acuity from 1/30th (finger at 30 cm) at birth to 10/10th at around 5-6 years (in first grade)

ยง Ocular tracking, mono and binocular fixation, convergence, onset of colour vision (initially red) at 4 months.

ยง Stereoscopic vision at 6 months
