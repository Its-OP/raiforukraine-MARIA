# Prevention

- Avoiding or delaying the first use of substances

- Acting on early consumption (primary prevention)

- Preventing the onset of dependency (secondary prevention)

- Reducing the risks and harm associated with consumption (tertiary prevention)


2. General management

- Comprehensive: multidisciplinary follow-up (psychiatric, medical and social); patient commitment; non-urgent; taking into account the patient's objective (stopping or reducing consumption).

- Mostly outpatient

- Hospitalisation required in cases of co-addiction or comorbid psychiatric or non-psychiatric medical disorders.

- Individual and group treatment where possible

- Psychotherapy: motivational interviewing to help change, cognitive and behavioural therapies to prevent relapse, supportive psychotherapy in addition; multi-dimensional family therapies (involving educational or school workers) effective for young cannabis users.

- Addictology: assessment of dependence; cessation of misuse or reduction in consumption; treatment of withdrawal syndrome; smoking cessation to be discussed

- Provision of opioid substitution treatments (methadone in specialised centres, high-dose buprenorphine in general practice and in specialised centres)

- Assessing psychiatric complications and comorbidities
