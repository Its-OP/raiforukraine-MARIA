Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia in chronic phase

- Hyperleukocytosis with neutrophils (predominantly), eosinophils and basophils

- Balanced myelogenesis

- Demonstration of the BCR-ABL1 transcript in blood or bone marrow

- Myelogram: rich marrow without excess blasts or maturation disorders (chronic phase)

- Karyotype: translocation t(9 ;22), additional anomalies possible
