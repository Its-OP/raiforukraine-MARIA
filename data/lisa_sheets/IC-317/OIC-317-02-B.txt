Myeloproliferative syndromes are associated with acquired genetic abnormalities (translocations, mutations) that occur in a haematopoietic stem cell and are responsible for the predominant proliferation of a given myeloid lineage.

- Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML): translocation t(9;22) (der22 is also known as the Philadelphia chromosome) and BCR-ABL1 transcript

- Polyglobulia Vaquez (PV): JAK2 mutations

- Essential thrombocythemia (ET): mutations in JAK2, CALR or MPL
