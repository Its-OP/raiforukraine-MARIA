Chronic myeloid leukaemia. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (leader: imatinib mesylate). Monitored by quantification of BCR-ABL transcript by RTq-PCR in blood. Prognosis: Progression to accelerated or transformed phase is very rare, and occurs mainly in patients who have failed tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thanks to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, life expectancy is comparable to the general population.
