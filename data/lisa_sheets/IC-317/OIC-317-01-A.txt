Clonal myeloid haemopathies affecting a haematopoietic stem cell resulting in global bone marrow hyperplasia and increased production of figurative blood elements :

- Quantitative abnormality predominantly in the granulocytic (polymorphonuclear) lineage: chronic myeloid leukaemia

- Quantitative abnormality predominantly in the erythroblastic (red blood cell) lineage: primary polycythemia or Vaquez polycythemia

- Quantitative abnormality predominantly in the megakaryocytic (platelet) lineage: essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis


The incidence is approximately 1 to 2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year per type of myeloproliferation (except for primary myelofibrosis, which is rarer).

- The median age at diagnosis is between 50 and 70.

- Slightly more frequent in men (except essential thrombocythemia)
