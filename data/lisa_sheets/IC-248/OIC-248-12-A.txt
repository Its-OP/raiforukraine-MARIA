The aim is to ensure a good balance between a person's energy intake and energy requirements.


- Follow the dietary guidelines set out in the recommendations for the general population above (unless specifically advised otherwise by a doctor).

- Use your internal food signals (hunger, satiety) as a guide.

- Avoid snacking, excessive consumption and portions, ...

- Avoid dietary restrictions, which are sources of frustration and secondary compensations

- Take the time to eat and enjoy your meals, in a calm atmosphere with plenty of time to chew.


- Favour seasonal, local food, grown using methods that reduce the use of inputs (pesticides, fertilisers). Go for organic food. BUT the benefits of fruit and vegetables and wholegrain products have been demonstrated whether they are organic or not. You should therefore increase your portions, even if they are not organic. What's more, a fatty and/or sweet product, even an ORGANIC one, is still a fatty and/or sweet product, and its consumption should remain limited.

- Favour homemade food to raise awareness and control sugar and processed industrial product intake, particularly for children.

- Reduce consumption of NutriScore D or E foods.


The so-called 'Mediterranean diet' is a very good example, in its entirety, of a balanced and, what's more, sustainable diet. More broadly speaking, the "Mediterranean nutritional lifestyle" has been scientifically proven to have beneficial effects in a number of areas of health, particularly in the cardiovascular field.
