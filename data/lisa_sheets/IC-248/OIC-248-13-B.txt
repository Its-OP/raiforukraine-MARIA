All doctors are called upon to act on the three dimensions (diet, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle) of prevention on a daily basis and to promote the health of people with or without chronic pathologies, particularly "via" nutrition.

Primary prevention objectives must take into account diet, physical activity and sedentary lifestyles, with the priority objective of stabilising weight.


The process of changing behaviour requires time and support if it is to be sustainable. Getting people to commit to lifestyle changes when they are not really ready to do so is a guarantee of rapid failure. The relational approach to be used to support a change project is based on "empathy" and "active, benevolent listening", listening to the patient's difficulties and helping them to go neither too far nor too fast.


The carer must agree not to systematically provide an immediate therapeutic response and be capable of first carrying out a ''motivational interview/workshop'' in order to move the patient towards a ''personal dynamic'' of health promotion.

The aim is to ''determine, without stigmatizing or judging, the representations'' of the patient with regard to :

- the negative impact of habitual behaviour on health

- to the health issues involved

- to the necessary changes

- constraints/benefits

Reassurance is needed that the pleasure of eating will be maintained, that there will be no negative judgements, that free will will will be respected (joint determination of objectives), that change will be supported (acquisition of skills "via" educational sessions, for example) and that objectives will be readjusted.


It is also important to involve family and friends as much as possible.

As part of a preventive approach, the doctor should, if necessary, help the patient to manage stress and life difficulties more effectively (importance of taking account of the patient's needs, areas for relaxation and adequate sleep, and/or "reinforcing psychosocial skills").
