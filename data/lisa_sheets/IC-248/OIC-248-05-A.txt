A low level of physical activity is associated with an increased risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, coronary morbidity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, certain cancers, weight gain and psychological disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.).

Physical activity helps to prevent obesity, particularly in children. It protects against age-related diseases and thus helps to prevent loss of independence in the elderly.

Physical activity is not just a way of increasing energy expenditure, but also a way of boosting overall well-being and improving mental health (self-confidence and self-esteem, reducing anxiety, stress and the risk of depression).

In children, physical activity has favourable effects on physical fitness, body composition and bone health. It is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors and helps to improve mental health, as in adults (see above). Physical activity is also a factor in academic success.

Good physical condition is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular risk factors, an improvement in functional capacity, a reduction in chronic pain, particularly back pain, and a reduction in mortality (particularly cardiovascular).
