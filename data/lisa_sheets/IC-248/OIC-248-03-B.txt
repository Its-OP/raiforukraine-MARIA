The level of physical inactivity is assessed by the average time (in minutes or hours) spent awake, sitting or lying down on a daily basis.

'''Tools for measuring physical activity.'''
{| class="wikitable"
!'''Method'''
!'''Parameters measured'''
|-
|Indirect calorimetry


(method considered as the reference)
|Measurement of respiratory gas exchange (O<sub>2</sub> consumed and CO<sub>2</sub> produced) under different conditions:

o At rest: calculation of basic energy expenditure

o During a stress test: measurement of maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) which assesses the subject's cardiorespiratory capacity, reflecting their aptitude for endurance sports and their physical condition.

o During exercise: used to assess energy expenditure during exercise.

|AP (type, intensity, duration, frequency)

Energy expenditure linked to PA (calculated according to declaration)

|Pedometer
|Number of steps, distance covered.

A method for becoming aware of your PA level and achieving a goal
|-
|Accelerometer
|Activity and intensity in the form of acceleration expressed in strokes/min (counts).

Evaluates the energy expenditure associated with activity.
