Physical activity (PA) can be categorised into different areas:

- PA linked to travel (journeys to school, work, shopping, going upstairs);

- PA linked to professional or school activities;

- leisure activities (walks, DIY, supervised or unsupervised sports activities);

- PA related to activities in the home (gardening, housework, looking after children, for example).

The level of physical activity is defined according to duration (minimum 10-minute sequences), intensity, frequency and the type or context of exercise (travel, work, leisure).
