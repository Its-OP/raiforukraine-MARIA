For children, the guidelines recommended by the Haut Conseil de la Santé Publique in the table above are applicable. Portion sizes need to be adapted to avoid excessive calorie intake: halved for the youngest children, adult portions around 11-12 years old, temporarily exceeding them for teenagers. The right diet for the child's age can be assessed by monitoring the child's growth curve and body mass index (BMI).

== Main guidelines specific to children: ==
- from birth to 4-6 months: exclusive milk-based diet, ideally exclusive breastfeeding, otherwise use specific infant formulas;

- between 4 and 6 months: introduction of dietary diversification, with no restrictions on the choice of foods (fruit, vegetables, legumes, dairy products, eggs, meat, fish) and with a preference for home-made preparations; no use of vegetable drinks before the age of one year;

- For children aged 3 to 17, the recommendations are the same as for adults, with the exception of the 3 to 4 dairy products recommended per day (instead of 2 for adults).

== General advice for parents: ==
- Internal food sensations and signals (hunger, satiation) are innate, so it's a question of maintaining them and helping them to become aware of them (e.g. don't force a child to systematically finish his plate).

- The context of the meal is important: calm with sufficient chewing time and in a serene atmosphere, without distractions (which can divert attention from satiation signals, such as screens).

- In young children, to combat food neophobia and encourage a diversified diet in adulthood, it is necessary to get them used to eating different foods (particularly fruit and vegetables) before the age of 2. This involves asking the child to taste the food without forcing them to do so, and to represent the food several times in a variety of ways. Set an example for the other guests and encourage them.
