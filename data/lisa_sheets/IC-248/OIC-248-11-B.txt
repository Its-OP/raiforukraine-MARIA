Physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle are two complementary dimensions.

Any increase in physical activity and breaking the sedentary lifestyle should be encouraged; the recommendations are targets that individuals should gradually achieve, but even small changes have been associated with a significant improvement in all-cause mortality. The greatest observed gain in health is for inactive subjects who become at least moderately active.
