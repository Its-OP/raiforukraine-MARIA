A low level of physical activity is associated with an increased risk of total and cardiovascular mortality, coronary morbidity, type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension, certain cancers, weight gain and psychological disorders (anxiety, depression, etc.).

The increase in physical inactivity has contributed to a rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and their cardiometabolic complications. A sedentary lifestyle is associated with all-cause mortality, the incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and the risk of bone demineralisation in the elderly.
