=='''In the elderly, the guidelines apply, but:'''==
-maintain the quantities of food usually consumed to cover requirements

-The portion of dairy products can be increased to 3, as this is an interesting source of protein for this age group.

==''For children:'''==
0-36 months: exclusive milk-based nutrition (ideally breast-feeding, otherwise specific formula for the infant's age)

between 4 and 6 months: in addition, introduction of dietary diversification, with no restrictions on choice of food; no use of plant-based drinks before the age of one; respect for sleep patterns; no exposure to screens before the age of 3, particularly during mealtimes.

-Between 3 and 17 years of age: food group recommendations are the same as for adults, except for the recommended amount of dairy products (3 per day). It is important to adapt the portion sizes: reduced by half compared with adults for the youngest children, they gradually reach the adult portion size at around 11-12 years of age, and temporarily exceed it for teenagers.

Foods to avoid: coffee, tea, soft drinks and other caffeinated beverages, sweeteners and sweetened drinks.

Foods to limit: soya-based products (exposure to phytoestrogens) and chocolate (exposure to nickel).
