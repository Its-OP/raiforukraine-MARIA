Nutritional behaviours (food and physical activity) reflect the "long-standing habits" of individuals, rooted in a "personal, family and cultural history", and for which change can be difficult. Any change must be made gradually and with ''respect for individual values'' if it is to be maintained over time.


It is necessary to take account of "constraints external" to individuals: "equipment and the built environment" and "the food environment" (e.g. food marketing, price and accessibility of products, etc.).


Knowing the person's "experience" of previous physical and sporting activities and the reasons for any interruptions enables us to "find levers" to support motivation and assess any "obstacles".


Motivation is the likelihood that a person will initiate, continue and adhere to a behaviour change strategy. It is the result of conscious and unconscious factors determining the individual's actions, and differs from willpower and courage.

A lack of motivation to change behaviour can be explained by :

- A ''lack of awareness of the health issues and the determinants'' of the behaviours to be changed;

- Denial'' of the potential consequences of current behaviour. But beware, the threat of complications, which generates anxiety, is neither an ethical nor an effective method.

- L''''apprehension of constraints/frustrations''''

- A '''low''' '''sense of self-efficacy''' in implementing change

- L'''' absence of self-determination''' of the person with regard to the change project



Certain individual obstacles (personal motivation, sense of self-efficacy) can be overcome by providing individual support to refocus the expected benefits on more health-promoting behaviours.
