It is estimated that 15% of all deaths worldwide are attributable to poor diet, particularly from cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, more than from smoking.

Metabolic diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and arterial hypertension) and cardiovascular risk are favoured, alongside genetic predisposition and other major risk factors such as smoking, by numerous nutritional risk factors:

- Excessive salt consumption,

- Excessive consumption of saturated fatty acids

- Low consumption of fruit and vegetables

- The risk of overweight and obesity is increased by a sedentary lifestyle, frequent consumption of sugary drinks and fast food, and a 'Western' eating style (particularly high consumption of fatty, sugary products and red meat). Conversely, the risk of weight gain is reduced by breastfeeding, regular physical activity, fibre-rich foods and a 'Mediterranean' diet (high consumption of plant-based foods, fish and white meat).

- Obesity is itself a risk factor for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, as well as certain cancers and osteoarticular pathologies.

More than 20% of new cases of cancer diagnosed each year are attributable to preventable nutritional risk factors (diet, alcohol, physical activity and weight status).
