===A.    Epidemiological aspects of organ transplantation===

*There is a shortage of organs. Needs far exceed transplant possibilities.
*There has been an overall increase in the number of registered organ transplant candidates.
*There has been an overall increase in the number of organ transplants performed.

===B.    Results===

*Transplantation is prolonging and improving the lives of an increasing number of patients with end-stage failure of one or more organs.
*The results of organ transplantation are expressed as actuarial survival, calculated for the survival of the transplanted organ and the survival of the recipient (Table 1).
*Actuarial survival varies according to the organs transplanted.

===C.    Administrative organisation===
The administrative organisation of organ transplantation activities is based on the Agence de la Biomédecine (Biomedicine Agency), which has the following missions:

*Managing the national list of patients awaiting transplantation;
*co-ordinating organ harvesting and the distribution and allocation of harvested organs;
evaluating the medical activities of transplantation teams; * managing the National Refusal Register (RNR);
*managing the National Register of Refusals to Transplant (RNR);
*promoting transplantation research;
*promoting organ donation.


The award rules depend on :

*medical criteria (e.g. ABO blood group, HLA compatibility, shortest possible cold ischaemia time);
*equity criteria (e.g. waiting time);
*priority criteria that depend on the urgency of the transplant and the difficulty of finding a compatible recipient.
