Organ donation is governed by 3 major ethical principles enshrined in the French Bioethics Act:

*presumed consent'';''''
*free donation'';''''
*anonymity between donor and recipient'''.''''


The removal of organs from donors in a state of encephalic death is governed by the 1994 bioethics laws, which are based on the principle of presumed consent.

In addition, there is a National Register of Refusals (RNR) managed by the Agence de la Biomédecine (French Biomedicine Agency), where people who are opposed to organ removal can register their refusal during their lifetime. This register will be automatically consulted before any removal procedure.

Since 1 January 2017, all deceased persons diagnosed as brain dead have been considered as donors by default''''''''' If a person is opposed to the removal of blood during their lifetime, they must register on the national refusal register or provide their next of kin with oral or written testimony. Relatives may testify to the refusal, but they must sign an official document certifying the deceased's refusal.
