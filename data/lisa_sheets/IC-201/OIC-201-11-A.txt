The shortage of organs has gradually led to a widening of the circle of living donors, whose regulatory framework is governed by the Bioethics laws (table 3).

Living donor transplants are mainly used for kidney transplants (15.2% in 2018) and to a lesser extent for liver transplants (1% in 2018).

The living donor kidney transplant project has several advantages for the recipient:

*It makes it possible to carry out transplants requiring specific preparation of the recipient prior to transplantation, such as ABO-incompatible transplants between donor and recipient, or desensitisation of the recipient with an anti-HLA antibody directed against an HLA antigen of the donor;
*It offers better long-term survival of the transplanted organ;
*It is a powerful means of combating the shortage of transplants;
*It reduces the recipient's waiting time;
*The living-donor kidney transplant project makes it possible to carry out a pre-emptive transplant, i.e. one performed before the recipient has had to start extra-renal purification.


The medical assessment of the potential donor ensures that there are no underlying pathologies and seeks to minimise the risks to the donor.


Prior to transplantation, the protection of future donors is ensured by :

*the living donor committee, which authorises or refuses to authorise the donation and ensures that the living donor is free to make his or her own decision;
*the President of the Judicial Court (formerly the High Court), who checks that consent is free and informed and that the donation complies with the conditions laid down by law.
