Immunosuppression is intended to :

*Prevent acute rejection in the initial phase (induction treatment);
*prevent rejection after the initial phase (maintenance treatment);
*treat acute rejection (curative treatment).


Induction treatment :

*It allows strong immunosuppression to be introduced during the first few days of transplantation, when the risk of rejection is highest.
*The molecules used are polyclonal antibodies that deplete T lymphocytes or a non-depleting monoclonal antibody.


Maintenance treatment :

*The aim is to prevent the occurrence of an acute rejection episode in the long term, with the least possible iatrogenicity.
*Maintenance treatment usually involves a combination of 2 or 3 immunosuppressive agents from different families (Table 2).

Immunosuppressive treatment increases the risk of infectious and tumour complications, warranting [[Follow-up of immunosuppressed patients SD-291|suu suivi spécialisé]].
