Organ transplants are carried out taking into account :

*compatibility in the ABO blood group system (ABO-incompatible transplants are nevertheless possible in certain circumstances);
*HLA tissue group compatibility;
*(The rhesus group is not taken into account).


Tissue compatibility is assessed by :

*HLA typing of the donor and recipient;
*testing for anti-HLA antibodies in the recipient, the presence of which may limit access to a compatible graft, increase the risk of post-transplant rejection and reduce the lifespan of the graft;
*The cross-match test just before transplantation, which identifies the presence in the recipient's serum of cytotoxic antibodies directed against the donor's antigens.
