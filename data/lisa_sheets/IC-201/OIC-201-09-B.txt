===A.    Diagnostic features of encephalic death are based on:===

*clinical criteria:
**Total absence of consciousness and spontaneous motor activity;
**Abolition of all brainstem reflexes;
**Total absence of spontaneous ventilation verified by a hypercapnia test.
*and paraclinical criteria:
**2 null and reactive electroencephalograms for 30 minutes performed 4 hours apart;
**or cerebral angiography showing cessation of encephalic circulation.

===B.    The donor with a stopped heart===
French law authorises donation "from a deceased person in persistent cardiac and respiratory arrest". These are known as deceased donors after circulatory arrest (DDAC).

A distinction is made between :

*donors who have suffered an "uncontrolled" out-of-hospital cardiac arrest;
*donors who have suffered circulatory arrest in intensive care following a decision to stop active treatment.


Once proof of death has been obtained by recording an electrocardiogram lasting 5 minutes without QRS complexes or with agonic complexes < 5 per minute, a death report is drawn up, enabling the National Refusal Register (RNR) to be queried immediately, which is compulsory before any organ retrieval procedure can begin.
