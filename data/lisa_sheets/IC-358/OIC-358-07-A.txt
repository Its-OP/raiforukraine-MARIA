In the event of a combination of suggestive pain + liposaemia greater than 3N, no examination is necessary for a positive diagnosis of AP.

The two main tests are abdominal ultrasonography (for aetiological purposes) and abdomino-pelvic CT scan with contrast injection (for prognosis and differential diagnosis): they are complementary (Table 1).

Abdominal ultrasound is only used for aetiological orientation, essentially looking for vesicular lithiasis, more rarely for dilatation of the main bile duct and very rarely for lithiasis of the main bile duct (ultrasound is not very sensitive for lithiasis of the main bile duct). It should be carried out systematically, ideally within 48 hours (risk of vesicular sludge induced by fasting), and abdomino-pelvic CT cannot replace it as it is less effective in diagnosing gallbladder disease.

Abdominal and pelvic CT scans with injection of contrast medium are mainly used to assess the severity of the disease (although they may identify differential diagnoses). Performed after creatinine measurement, it should not be done too early, as it may minimise the severity of the pancreatitis. It is carried out approximately 72 hours after the onset of pain. If there is any uncertainty (patient seen after the peak of lipasemia or atypical pain), an abdomino-pelvic CT scan can confirm AP if it shows characteristic lesions.
Abdominal and pelvic CT scans show :

- The presence and extent of pancreatic necrosis (lack of enhancement of the pancreas in the early stages) or peripancreatic necrosis.

- The presence and location of necrosis collections

- Complications such as ascites, pleural effusion, fistula, haemorrhage or perforation of a hollow organ.

Abdominal and pelvic CT scans are used to calculate a severity score known as the CTSI (Computed-Tomography Severity Index), which combines the extent of necrosis and enhancement of the pancreas (Table 2). A score of 4 or more indicates severe pancreatitis, with a higher risk of death and severe complications.
