Superinfection of pancreatic necrosis flows is a serious complication of AP, associated with excess mortality.

Onset: 2 to 4 weeks after the start of hospitalisation

Mechanism: bacterial translocation originating in the digestive tract

Evocative signs :

* clinical: hyperthermia ('''"'' ''[[Hyperthermia/fever SDD-044|hyperthermia/fever]]'''), onset or worsening of SIRS
* biological: appearance or increase in a biological inflammatory syndrome ('''" [[C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation SD-203|C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation]]", "[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SDD-186|acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome]"'')
* radiological: presence of air bubbles within necrotic flows on CT scan (inconstant) ('''" [Discovery of an abdominal abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-224|discovery of an abdominal abnormality on medical imaging examination]]"'')

Differential diagnoses: other causes of infection: value of multi-site bacteriological sampling in the initial phase (ECBU, catheter swab, lung sample)
