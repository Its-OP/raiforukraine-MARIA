The positive diagnosis of AP is based on the association of:
'''Evocative abdominal pain + Lipasemia greater than 3 times normal (3N)'''


*'''''[[Evocative abdominal pain SDD-004|Evocative abdominal pain]]''''':
Pancreatic pain is present in over 90% of cases and is usually typical with :

- location: mainly epigastric, rarely extending to the hypochondria

- rapid onset, increasing within a few hours

- very intense

- with dorsal radiation, transfixing

- with inhibition of inspiration

- pain-relieving "gun dog" position


Abdominal pain may be accompanied by other clinical manifestations:

- vomiting due to reflex ileus

- frequent aural meteorism on clinical examination

- general signs: fever, tachycardia, hypotension


*'''[[Elevation of lipasemia greater than 3 times normal (3N) SDD-205|Elevation of lipasemia greater than 3 times normal (3N)]] ''''

- The peak in lipasemia is sometimes brief, peaking 24 to 48 hours after the onset of pain. After 48 hours, blood lipase levels may fall below 3N.

- the level of lipasemia does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis and has no prognostic value.
