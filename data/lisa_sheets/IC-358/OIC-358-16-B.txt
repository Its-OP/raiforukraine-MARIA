The two main late complications are the appearance of pseudocysts or organised necrotic collections:

- These are fluid collections, either of pancreatic fluid via a pancreatic fistula (pseudocyst) or linked to the organisation and liquefaction of foci of necrosis (organised necrotic collection);

- They may be completely asymptomatic or cause pain;

- They may disappear spontaneously (less than 50% of cases) or be complicated by rupture, haemorrhage or compression of neighbouring organs (bile ducts, duodenum, blood vessels, etc.);

- They are identified by ultrasound or, more often, by CT scan.
