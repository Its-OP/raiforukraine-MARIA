The immediate severity of the BP is assessed on the basis of the following elements:

* the presence of a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS)
* the presence of one or more organ failures (shock, consciousness disorders, acute renal failure, acute respiratory distress, disseminated intravascular coagulation)
* the patient's history: risk of decompensation of a chronic disease

The presence of criteria of immediate severity requires hospitalisation in an intensive care unit (absence of organ failure) or in intensive care (1 or more organ failures).
