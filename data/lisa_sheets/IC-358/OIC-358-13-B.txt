'''PA of biliary origin'''

Biliary calculi should be detected by imaging as a matter of urgency, in order to make an aetiological diagnosis and treat any lithiasis embedded in the ampulla of Vater (although 80% of choledocholiths evacuate spontaneously). When they are large, they can be seen on abdominal ultrasound or CT scan.

Treatment of biliary calculosis of the common bile duct is essential to prevent a recurrence of unpredictable severity.

It includes :

* Extraction of stones lodged in the common bile duct'' : Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) with endoscopic sphincterotomy '''(" [[Request and preparation for endoscopic examinations (bronchial, digestive) SD-238|request and preparation for endoscopic examinations (bronchial, digestive)]]", "[[Preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|preoperative explanation and collection of consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]]"''): 
** as a matter of urgency (< 24 h) in the event of initially associated angiocholitis
** otherwise at a distance

* Probabilistic antibiotic therapy after blood cultures if associated angiocholitis

* '''Systematic cholecystectomy''' (''''" [Pre-operative explanation and consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure SD-239|pre-operative explanation and consent for an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure]"''). In most cases, it is carried out ''before'' resumption of oral feeding, which encourages vesicular contractions and increases the risk of recurrence of biliary AP or other lithiasis complications:
** during the same hospital stay in the case of non-severe BP
** depending on the patient's clinical condition in the case of severe BP (often deferred for 3 to 6 weeks after the initial episode).


'''Non-biliary PA''''

They involve treating the cause (managing excessive alcohol consumption, treating a metabolic or tumour-related cause, etc.) and managing the aggravating factors (stopping smoking).
