Overall mortality in AP is less than 5%.

The rate of benign AP is less than 1%.

In the case of severe AP, mortality is around 10% but is higher in the case of infected necrosis '''(" [[Announcement of a diagnosis of serious illness to the patient and/or his/her family SD-327|announcement d'un diagnostic de maladie grave au patient et/ou Ã  sa famille]]"'').

The initial prognosis is conditioned by immediate complications (shock, respiratory distress, multi-visceral failure syndrome).

The delayed prognosis is linked to superinfection of necrosis, which most often occurs between the 2<sup>th</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> week.

In the longer term, exocrine or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes) may develop. These two complications are more frequent in cases of severe BP.
