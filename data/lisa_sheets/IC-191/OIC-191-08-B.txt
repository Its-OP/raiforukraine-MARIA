Certain microbiological tests are carried out systematically:

* Peripheral aero-anaerobic blood cultures and central blood cultures if a central venous catheter is used, prior to any antibiotic treatment.
* Urine cytobacteriological examination (ECBU)'''
* Additional biological tests:'''' CBC, TP TCA fibrinogen, Ionogram, renal and hepatic function, CRP
* Additional imaging tests:'''  Chest X-ray or CT scan without injection

Certain examinations will be carried out according to a point of call:

* Cytobacteriological examination of sputum (ECBC), nasopharyngeal sampling for PCR of respiratory viruses during epidemics if respiratory symptoms are present.
* Stool culture if diarrhoea, clostridium test if prior antibiotic treatment

If fever persists after 48 hours of probabilistic antibiotic therapy, the following tests should be carried out:

* A thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan to look for a deep-seated infection.
* Aspergillosis antigenemia and B-D glucans, mycological blood cultures to support a suspicion of fungal infection (aspergillosis) if neutropenia ≥ 7 days.
