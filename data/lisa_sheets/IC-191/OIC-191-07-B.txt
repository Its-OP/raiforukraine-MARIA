'''Cellular immunity deficiencies''' (Immunosuppressive treatment for autoimmune disease or organ transplantation, corticosteroids, even in small doses, HIV infection ....)

*CMV
*Pneumocystis jirovecii
*More rarely Toxoplasma, Aspergillus, Candida, Nocardia, BK (anti-TNF)

Humoral immunity deficiencies (CVID, treatment with anti CD20, CLL, etc.)

*extra-cellular bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus Influenzae.

Neutropenia (chemotherapy, etc.)

*Gram-negative bacteria (enterobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa),
*Staphylococci in the presence of catheters
*Fungi (Aspergillus or Candida) in cases of deep and prolonged neutropenia.

'''Complement deficiencies''' (use of therapeutic anti-C5 antibodies, hereditary deficiencies)

*Neisseiria (meningitidis +++)

'''Organ transplant patients'''

*Early phase (< 1 month): infections are most often nosocomial (pneumopathies, urinary tract infections, toxoplasmosis acquired via the graft, etc.).
*Intermediate phase (1 to 6 months): major cellular deficiency: CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii +++, toxoplasmosis (reactivation).
*Late phase (>6 months): persistent but less profound cellular deficiency.
