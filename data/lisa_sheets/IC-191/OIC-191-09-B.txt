Systematic intravenous antibiotic therapy, including a broad-spectrum β-lactam active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, must be started as a matter of urgency: piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime.

An ''aminoglycoside'' should be added if there is any sign of severity or if multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria are suspected.

If skin infection, catheter infection and/or colonisation with multi-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is suspected: add a glycopeptide (vancomycin).  

'''Special case: oral antibiotic therapy may be proposed if all the following criteria are met:'''

- Non-profound neutropenia (≥0.1 G/L)

- Neutropenia < 7 days

- No signs of seriousness

- No history of risk (e.g. chronic respiratory insufficiency)

- No signs of digestive intolerance

In these cases, antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid + ciprofloxacin may be proposed.

In all cases, reassessment of the regular situation

Antibiotic therapy must be maintained throughout the period of neutropenia. If the patient is released from aplasia: antibiotic therapy should be continued for at least 48 hours after apyrexia, in the absence of microbiological identification.
