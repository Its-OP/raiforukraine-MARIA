'''Origin''': asplenia may be post-splenectomy or functional asplenia (e.g. sickle cell anaemia patient).

'''Fièvre chez asplénique'''

* Fever in an asplenic patient is a therapeutic emergency due to the risk of OPSI (Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection): a fulminant infection, most often pneumococcal.
* In the event of unexplained fever in an asplenic patient, antibiotic therapy active against encapsulated bacteria must be started as a matter of urgency following appropriate microbiological sampling: 3rd generation parenteral cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), etc.

'''Prevention of infectious risks:'''

* Vaccinations: if splenectomy: at least 2 weeks before splenectomy or at least 2 weeks after if emergency splenectomy.
** Anti-pneumococcal: 13-valent conjugate vaccine then 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine at least two months after the conjugate vaccine and 5 years afterwards.
** Anti-meningococcal: tetravalent ACYW135 and B.
** Anti-Haemophilus B: 1 single injection
** Don't forget the ''usual vaccination schedule'' (Rq: ''no vaccination contraindication for asplenics)''.
* Antibiotic prophylaxis with penicillin V (oracillin) for 2 years after splenectomy in adults.
* Patient education: consultation in the event of fever, vaccination, splenectomy card, etc.
