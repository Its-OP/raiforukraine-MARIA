Vaccination in the case of immunodepression has certain specific features which justify specific recommendations

* the risk of developing vaccine disease after administration of a live vaccine contraindicates the use of these vaccines in immunocompromised patients;
* the reduced immunogenicity of vaccines may, in some cases, justify special vaccination regimens;
* an increased risk of complications associated with certain infections justifies the recommendation of specific vaccinations.
* When immunosuppressive treatment can be planned, patients should be vaccinated at least 2 weeks before the start of the treatment.
* In certain situations, protective serum antibodies may be measured four to six weeks after vaccination (or at a later date) in order to check the immunogenicity of the vaccination and suggest additional injections if the response is insufficient.

'''''Counter indications'''''

*The existence of an immune deficiency is a contraindication to vaccination with a live attenuated vaccine (MMR, BCG, oral polio vaccine, yellow fever, VZV).

'''''Indications'''''

*In immunocompromised patients, we must ensure that the vaccination schedule is up to date.
*Immunocompromised patients should receive an influenza vaccination every year.
*Certain specific vaccines will be used depending on the immunodeficiency concerned.


Examples:

''Patients living with HIV:''

* Schedule vaccines
* Pneumococcal vaccination: conjugate vaccine then polysaccharide vaccine 2 months and 5 years later
* Annual influenza vaccination
* Vaccination against HBV
* Live attenuated vaccines contraindicated if CD4<0.2G/L
