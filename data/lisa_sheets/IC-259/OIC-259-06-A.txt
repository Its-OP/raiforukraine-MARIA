==Circumstances of diagnosis==
The diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome is generally straightforward in adults and is made in two main circumstances:

*rapid or progressive onset of oedema syndrome
**soft, white, painless, cup-shaped oedemas
**predominates in declining areas and areas of low extravascular pressure (eye orbit).
**transudative pleural effusion (pleura, pericardium, peritoneum) may be observed, resulting in anasarca
**weight gain'' is constant and enables the extent of fluid retention to be quantified
*the discovery of abundant proteinuria during a systematic examination (occupational medicine, school medicine, follow-up of a systemic pathology).
*In children:
**The usual age of onset of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is 1 to 10 years, with a higher incidence in boys.
**Sudden onset of oedematous syndrome, sometimes revealing complications
**Triggering factor sometimes found: infection, allergy, etc.

==Biological tests==

===In urine===

*Proteinuria, possibly detected by the use of urine strips at the patient's bedside, is confirmed in the laboratory. It is ''permanent and abundant (> 3 g/d)''.
*Analysis of the urine sediment is used to check for possible association with microscopic ''[[Haematuria SD-102|haematuria]]'''. Examination of the urine pellet looks for '''haematic cylinders''', which indicate the glomerular origin of the haematuria.

===In the blood===

*Hypoalbuminemia < 30 g/L.
*Analysis of the [[Biological abnormalities (haemogram and protein electrophoresis) 2C-192-EC-A01|plasma protein electrophoresis]] shows a change in the distribution of globulins with :
**an increase in α2-globulins, β-globulins and fibrinogen
**a decrease in gamma globulins
*L''''[[Dyslipidaemias|hyperlipidaemia]]''' is common with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
*Hypoproteinemia is associated with total hypocalcaemia due to a decrease in the fraction of calcium bound to albumin (normal ionised calcium).
*Elevated creatinine levels vary according to the cause of the nephrotic syndrome and whether it is associated with organic or functional renal failure.

==Initial diagnostic orientation==
When faced with a nephrotic syndrome, one must :

*Establish whether the nephrotic syndrome is ''pure'' or ''impure
*Study the onset and duration of oedema (a few days or several weeks).
*Look for a ''triggering factor'':
**taking certain medications (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lithium, interferon, etc.)
**Vaccinations in adults and children SD-322|vaccination]]
**recent infectious syndrome

*Look for ''extrarenal signs'' suggestive of a general illness:
**Angina in adults and children and nasopharyngitis in children|angina]]
**Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|purpura]], skin lesions
**[[Joint pain SD-067|arthralgia]]
**Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|adenopathies]], ...
