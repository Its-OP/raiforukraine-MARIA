*Pathological proteinuria corresponds to an abnormal urinary elimination rate (> 150 mg/d or mg/g) and quality of protein''.
*The rate of proteinuria can be measured on a 24-hour urine sample, or estimated on the basis of a urine sample, provided that it is related to creatininuria (to avoid the impact of urine concentration/dilution). Urinary excretion of creatinine in an adult is approximately 1 g/d, or 8.84 mmol/d (this last value is rounded to 10 for convenience). Example: proteinuria/creatininuria 700 mg/mmol creatinine = 7 g/g creatinine. Estimated 24-hour proteinuria is 7 g/d.
*The term microalbuminuria is accepted in practice and corresponds to a moderately increased excretion of albumin in the urine (30-300 mg/d).
