A schematic distinction is made between primary and secondary nephrotic syndromes:

*A nephrotic syndrome is said to be primary or idiopathic if the aetiological investigation is negative (there is no obvious cause and no extra-renal signs). Primary glomerular nephropathies are then defined according to their histological type. In adults, the most frequent causes of primary nephrotic syndrome are extra-membranous glomerulopathy, nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular lesions and primary segmental and focal hyalinosis (Cf [[Glomerular Nephropathy]]).  In children, idiopathic nephrotic syndrome accounts for the majority of cases (90% of cases before the age of 8).
*A nephrotic syndrome is secondary if the glomerular nephropathy is the consequence of a general disease (diabetes, lupus, amyloidosis, etc.), infectious, toxic or tumour-related causes, or genetic causes. The main causes of secondary nephrotic syndromes are summarised in the table below.
