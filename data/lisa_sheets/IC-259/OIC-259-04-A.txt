*The nephrotic syndrome has a strictly biological definition which associates :
**'''proteinuria >''' '''3 g/24h''' (> 50 mg/kg/d or 2 g/g in children)
**albuminemia < 30 g/L'''.
*Nephrotic syndrome is considered ''pure'' if it is not accompanied by :
**'''neither microscopic [[haematuria]]''''
**'''nor [[Hypertension in adults and children|hypertension]] '''
**'''nor organic [[Acute renal failure - Anuria|renal failure]]''' (which may initially be difficult to distinguish from functional renal failure)
*The nephrotic syndrome is described as ''impure'' if it is associated with one or more of the above.
