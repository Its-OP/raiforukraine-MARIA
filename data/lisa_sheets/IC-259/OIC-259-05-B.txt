The passage of a large quantity of albumin in the urine results from an '''anomaly in''' '''glomerular capillary permeability''' which may be linked to :

* a ''constitutional abnormality of the structure'' '''of the glomerular basement membrane'' (for example in Alport syndrome)
* a ''loss of electronegative charge'' of the glomerular basement membrane in minimal glomerular damage nephrotic syndrome (MGDNS). A circulating factor is also suspected in SNLGM, particularly in its caricatured form which recurs after renal transplantation
* glomerular deposits, as in extramembranous glomerulonephritis or amyloidosis
* alteration of the podocytes, sometimes secondary to alteration of the glomerular endothelium, as in certain thrombotic microangiopathies

Urinary leakage of albumin exceeds the liver's capacity to synthesise it, leading to hypoalbuminemia.
