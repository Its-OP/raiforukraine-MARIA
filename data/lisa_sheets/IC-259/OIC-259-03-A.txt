== Quantitative analysis

=== Semi-quantitative method''' ''': urine dipstick ===

* This is the most widely used screening technique. It detects the presence of albumin when it exceeds 50-100 mg/L.
* This method does not detect immunoglobulin light chains or other low molecular weight proteins.
* Interpretation of the strip:
** Normal or non-significant result: absence of proteinuria, traces or 1 + (< 0.3 g/L).
** Abnormal results: 2 + (about 1 g/L) or 3 + (about 3 g/L)

=== Proteinuria weight measurement ===
It is expressed :

* in g/24 hours,
* in g/g or g/mmol on a urine sample by the proteinuria/creatinuria ratio

The presence of [[Haematuria SD-102|haematuria]] or abundant [[Urinary tract infections in children and adults|pyuria]] may interfere with the interpretation of proteinuria. Macroscopic haematuria (not microscopic haematuria) is the cause of abundant proteinuria (1-2 g/d, due to haemolysis of red blood cells in the urine).

== Qualitative analysis

=== Urinary protein electrophoresis ===
This provides a qualitative study of proteinuria, useful for identifying its origin:

* Glomerular proteinuria: albumin is the main protein present in the urine in cases of glomerular damage (>60% of total proteinuria).
* Tubular proteinuria'': consists essentially of low molecular weight proteins and results from a proximal tubular reabsorption disorder. Isolated tubular proteinuria is rare and is usually accompanied by other signs of proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome).
* Overload proteinuria: results from an increase in synthesis (Kappa or Lambda light chain during [[Biological abnormalities (haemogram and protein electrophoresis) 2C-192-EC-A01|dysglobulinemia]]) or release (myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis) and an excess of tubular reabsorption capacity. Immunofixation of urinary proteins is necessary to characterise the monoclonal protein in question (Kappa or Lambda light chain).

=== Microalbuminuria (or moderately increased albuminuria) ===

* It is a marker of early ''[[Diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications|diabetic nephropathy]]. S'''a measurement should be carried out once a year in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus.
* In the general population and particularly in cases of arterial hypertension SD-042|arterial hypertension]], microalbuminuria is also an independent marker of high cardiovascular risk.
