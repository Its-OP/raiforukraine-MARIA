Oedema in nephrotic syndrome reflects two abnormalities, mainly due to hypoalbuminemia:

* the passage of sodium and water to the interstitial sector, by reducing plasma oncotic pressure
* a [[Disturbance in acid-base balance and hydro-electrolytic disorders|tubular sodium reabsorption]], linked in particular to effective hypovolaemia, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic systems
