===Treatment of oedema syndrome===
It is based on :

*sodium restriction (2-4g NaCl/day)
*prescription of loop diuretics (Furosemide or Bumetanide). Depending on the response obtained, assessed on the basis of weight, urine volume and natriuresis/24 hours, the diuretic may be adapted at increasing dosage in 2 to 3 doses per day (diuretics are rarely prescribed in children because of the risk of hypercoagulability, only in the case of very large effusions with albumin infusion).
*in the event of resistance, the other distal sites of sodium retention can be blocked under close monitoring (kalaemia and volaemia) by combining other diuretics acting at the level of :
**collecting tubule (amiloride)
**the distal convoluted tubule (thiazide diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide)

Natriuretic response must be achieved "progressively" (target = loss of less than 1 kg/d) to avoid hypovolaemia and the risk of venous thrombosis (favoured by haemoconcentration).

In the absence of hyponatremia (which corresponds to a disorder of intracellular rather than extracellular hydration), there is no need to restrict water intake.
