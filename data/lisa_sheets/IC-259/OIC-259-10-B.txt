The general treatment of proteinuria is summarized in the [[:File:Diagnostic tree for proteinuria.jpg|Figure]]

== Transient proteinuria
These are intermittent proteinurias associated with certain physiological or pathological circumstances:

* orthostatic proteinuria (see below)
* exercise-induced proteinuria, observed after prolonged intense physical exercise
* high fever
* urinary tract infections
* congestive heart failure

Orthostatic proteinuria is observed during puberty (12-16 years) and disappears spontaneously before the age of 20. It is characterised by the "disappearance of clinostatic proteinuria" (urine collected after 2 hours' rest in a supine position). Orthostatic proteinuria is not pathological and requires no further investigation once confirmed.

== Permanent proteinuria ==
Diagnostic orientations depend on the rate of proteinuria, its composition and associated abnormalities (hypertension, haematuria, renal failure, any ultrasound abnormalities).

Nephrological advice should be sought in the presence of permanent proteinuria > 0.5 g/d and in the presence of associated abnormalities.

The main situations leading to an ''indication for renal biopsy'' are presented in the [[:Fichier:Arbre diagnostique devant une protéinurie.jpg|Figure]]. In practice, renal biopsy is always essential in cases of nephrotic syndrome, except in the following cases:

* in children aged between 1 and 10 years if the nephrotic syndrome is pure and there are no extrarenal signs: on the basis of frequency, this is a nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular lesions (lipoid nephrosis)
* in long-standing diabetic patients with diabetic retinopathy and nephrotic syndrome without haematuria: based on frequency, this is nephrotic syndrome due to diabetic glomerulopathy
* in adults suspected of having amyloidosis if a biopsy of the accessory salivary glands establishes this diagnosis: amyloidosis is a systemic, diffuse disease, and the nephrotic syndrome is due to deposits similar to those seen in the salivary glands
* in cases of hereditary glomerulopathy already identified in the family, if no specific treatment can be proposed
* if the biopsy is dangerous (single kidney, haemostasis disorder, etc.).
