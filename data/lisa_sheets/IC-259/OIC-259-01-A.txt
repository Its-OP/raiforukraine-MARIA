* ''Physiological [[Proteinuria SD-212|proteinuria]] is 100 to 150 mg/d'''
* In the normal state, only low molecular weight proteins are freely filtered through the glomerulus. Physiological proteinuria is composed of :
** 60% low molecular weight proteins filtered through the glomerulus and not reabsorbed in their entirety (lysozyme, Î²-2 microglobulin and kappa and lambda light chains).
** 40% proteins secreted by the tubule (uromodulin or Tamm-Horsfall protein) or by the urothelium of the urinary tract.
* Under physiological conditions, the amount of albumin present in urine is less than 30 mg/d.
