Amblyopia can occur when something disturbs vision during the critical period (before the age of 6).

- '''Organic amblyopia''': There is an organic cause of the amblyopia, for example a cataract, retinal disease, corneal pathology, congenital glaucoma, etc.

'''- Amblyopia'''' '''functional''': these are due to the presence of a strabismus, a refractive disorder, for example anisometropia (asymmetry of refraction between the two eyes), or an untimely occlusion of one eye (bandage, occlusion, or even a simple lock of hair).

'''- Mixed amblyopia:''' the origin is both organic and functional.
