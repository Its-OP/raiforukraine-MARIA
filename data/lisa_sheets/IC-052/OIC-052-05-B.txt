Most of the time, a child's strabismus is linked to a disturbance in the acquisition of binocular vision. When the brain incorrectly associates retinal images from each eye, the alignment of the visual axes breaks down.

The various causes of disturbed binocular vision in children are as follows:

'''- Organic pathology''', which disturbs the vision of one eye: in particular, retinoblastoma or congenital cataract are to be feared.

'''- Uncorrected refractive error:''' Hyperopia, which can lead to excessive convergence due to excessive accommodation, or Anisometropia (strong unilateral myopia, for example).

'''- more rarely, dysfunction of an oculomotor muscle.'''
