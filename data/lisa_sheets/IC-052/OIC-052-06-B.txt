Strabismus is never normal; any child with strabismus should have a specialist examination within a week.

This assertion needs to be qualified for babies under 3 months of age, in whom intermittent deviation may be tolerated.

Any strabismus should be considered as a possible symptom of motor damage (oculomotor paralysis) or sensory damage (reduced visual acuity) and should therefore be investigated for underlying neurological or ocular damage by means of a full ophthalmological examination.        

'''Elements of orientation before a strabismus:'''

<u>Interrogation:</u>

- Date of onset of strabismus

- Direction of deviation

- Intermittent or permanent strabismus

- Dominance or alternation

<u>Clinical examination:</u>

- Examination of ocular motility

- Examination of visual acuity

- Examination of the anterior segment and fundus

- Examination of objective refraction under cycloplegia

- Measurement of deviation and binocular vision tests

'''Characterization of a strabismus.'''

A distinction is made between :

- strabismus according to the ''direction of deviation'' (esotropia or exotropia, hyper- or hypotropia)

- concomitant strabismus (no limitation of motility) or incomitant strabismus (spasms, variable angle or limitation of motility)

- strabismus according to ''age of onset'' (early onset before 9 months, with no experience of binocularity; up to 2 years, possibly the beginnings of binocularity but with fragile oculomotor balance leading very quickly to neutralisation and abnormal retinal correspondence; late onset after 2 years with possible normal binocular vision)

- constant" or "intermittent" squints

In concomitant strabismus, we distinguish between :

- ''precocious'': they are permanent and their binocularity is abnormal and will remain so. The aim of treatment is to try to restore bi-ocularity by reducing the deviation to a minimum.

- Late and/or intermittent strabismus: these are patients with normal binocularity, which will remain normal if treatment is rapid; these are normosensory strabismus patients whose treatment aims to restore the permanent use of binocular vision.
