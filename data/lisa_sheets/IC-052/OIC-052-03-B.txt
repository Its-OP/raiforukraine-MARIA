When there is a suspicion of strabismus, various examinations will enable us to confirm the diagnosis, determine the type of strabismus, the aetiology and the presence of associated amblyopia.

- '''Inspection:''' The diagnosis of strabismus is based on an examination of the corneal reflections. Misalignment of the corneal reflections is a sign of strabismus. It can be investigated using direct lighting or photographs.

- ''Cover-test'': in this test, the subject is asked to stare at a point straight ahead in the distance. One eye is masked by a cover and then the cover is moved to the opposite eye. In subjects with normal oculomotor parallelism, no movement is observed. When there is strabismus, a restitutive movement is observed when the mask is removed.

- '''Examination of'''' '''Ocular motility'''': to identify muscular limitations or hyperactions

- Lang stereotest:  This test is performed with both eyes open, and presents objects which appear in relief only if binocular vision exists.  

Measurement of visual acuity: Visual acuity can be measured at pre-school age using non-verbal optotypes (drawings). Specialised tests can also be used to assess visual acuity in very young children (bébévision in particular), but they are not used routinely.  

- '''Fond d'œil''': used to rule out an organic cause.

'''- Refraction under cycloplegia:''' Refraction should be measured in children after instillation of a cycloplegic eye drop (which paralyses accommodation), as the child's great ability to accommodate makes refraction without a cycloplegic unreliable.
