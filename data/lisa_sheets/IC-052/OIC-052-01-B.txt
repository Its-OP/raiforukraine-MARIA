The development of binocular vision takes place progressively in different stages. These are given as a guide, but there are physiological variations in dates:

- ''First week of life'': light reflex, photomotor reflex

- 2-4 weeks: pursuit reflex, which becomes established at around 2 months of age

- 4-12 weeks: fusion reflex, binocular coordination

- 3 months: vision of shapes. The convergence reflex and the fixation reflex on a fixed object appear.

- 4 months: hand-eye coordination

- From the age of 2: measurable visual acuity. First binocular vision

- '''From the age of 6:''' end of the critical phase. The risk of amblyopia becomes much lower
