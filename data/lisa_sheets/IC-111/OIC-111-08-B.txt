The choice of treatment (topical alone, topical and systemic) will depend on the severity of the acne.

The extent of the face (<half/>half/the whole face) and the number of nodules will be taken into account.

We generally give ourselves 3 months to assess the effectiveness of the treatment and adapt it''.

Light acne: topical treatments

Medium/severe acne: topical treatment and cyclins, and if this fails isotretinoin

Very severe acne: isotretinoin from the outset

It is advisable to continue topical treatment after remission.

=====''Topical treatments: three main classes'''=====
1. Topical retinoids: active on retentional lesions because they are keratolytic. Some have a slight anti-inflammatory action. Irritants

2. Benzoyl peroxide: essentially anti-inflammatory and slightly comedolytic Irritant/ photosensitising

3. Local antibiotics: erythromycin and clindamycin. Anti-inflammatory only. To be combined with a benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid and over a short period to avoid selecting resistant bacteria.

Combination treatments: retinoid + antibiotic or retinoid + benzoyl peroxide Improved compliance

===== '''Systemic treatments''' =====
1. Antibiotics :

Cyclins: anti-seborrhoeic and anti-inflammatory; 3-month course of treatment to prevent bacterial resistance. Side-effects: photo-toxicity, dental dyschromia.

Macrolides = alternative to cyclins for pregnant women and young children

2. Zinc gluconate: mildly anti-inflammatory. Useful in summer and during pregnancy.

====3. Isotretinoin====
Cumulative target dose 120 and 150 mg/kg

Side effects:

teratogenic = effective contraception for women of childbearing age

prescription regulations: booklet and consent

contraception compulsory 1 month before, during and 1 month after stopping treatment,

monthly plasma Î²-hCG and 5 weeks after stopping

dyslipidaemia= initial dosage and monitoring of liver and lipid levels

Dose-dependent mucocutaneous xerosis

possible initial worsening

risk of intracranial hypertension in association with cyclins (contraindication),

possible mood disorders
