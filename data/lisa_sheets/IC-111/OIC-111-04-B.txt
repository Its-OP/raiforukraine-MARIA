== Main clinical forms


'''Mixed acne''': most common form = combination of retentional and inflammatory lesions (papulo pustular acne). Usually starts at puberty.

'''Retention acne:''' the most common form of acne in its early stages. Few or no inflammatory lesions

'''Nodular acne''': severe form with nodular lesions. Greater risk of scarring, justifying specific therapeutic management.
