-1. Excessive stimulation of sebum production by the sebaceous gland leading to hyperseborrhoea.


-2. Peripheral hyperandrogenism due to hypersensitivity of androgen receptors present on sebocytes (genetic polymorphisms but with usually normal levels of circulating androgens).


'''-'''3'''.''' Hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes within the pilar infudibulum leading to the formation of comedones.

-4. Involvement of the microbiome (involvement of ''Cutibacterium acnes - formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes)'' = anaerobic Gram-positive bacillus secreting pro-inflammatory factors and multiplying in the hair and sebaceous glands due to obstruction of the pilary infudibulum).
