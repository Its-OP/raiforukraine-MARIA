The diagnosis is clinical

Clinical elements to look for :

'''1'''. '''Excessive seborrhoea''': oily, shiny skin on the mid-face and chest area

'''2. Retention lesions'''''''': mandatory for diagnosis''''''

closed comedones (also known as microcysts): small papules, normal or whitish in colour, which can become inflammatory

open comedones (also known as "blackheads"): by opening the duct and oxidising the keratin

'''3. Inflammatory lesions

'''superficial pustules''' through the evolution of papules and retention lesions

nodules that can develop into abscesses with significant scarring

<br />

====== '''4. Scars'' ======

====== Frequent if acne is left untreated. The risk of scarring varies according to the form of acne and warrants appropriate treatment ======
