Social protection is based on :

1) ''the payment of social benefits directly to individuals''.

These social benefits can be ''in cash with replacement income'' (daily allowances, retirement pensions) '''or in kind (reimbursement of expenses incurred'' such as the reimbursement of healthcare costs or direct funding of services: 2) "access to social services provided free of charge or at reduced prices" (cr√®ches, canteen meals).

There are six categories of benefits corresponding to as many risks:

* the "old age-survival" risk
** Old age is the most important risk. It includes pensions, the largest part of this risk and the largest part of social protection. It includes care for dependency, which is not yet recognised as a risk in its own right, despite the introduction of the personalised autonomy allowance (APA), instituted by the law of 20 July 2001, and the National Solidarity Fund for Autonomy, created by the law of 30 June 2004. It also includes benefits paid under the minimum old-age pension: the supplementary old-age allowance (ASV) and the solidarity allowance for the elderly (ASPA).
** Survivors' risk, which covers the needs arising from the death of a family member, usually the spouse.

* health risk
** This includes illness, disability, accidents at work and occupational diseases.

* the "maternity-family" risk
** This includes daily maternity benefits, care for pregnant women and various family benefits (family allowances, childcare subsidies).

* employment risk
** This includes unemployment compensation, aid for vocational rehabilitation and reintegration, and early retirement.

* housing risk
** This covers the various subsidies paid to households to help them meet their rent and loan repayments.

* the "poverty-social exclusion" risk
** This mainly concerns the active solidarity income (RSA).
