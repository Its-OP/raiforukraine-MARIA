Cash benefits are a replacement income. They are provided, for example, in the form of daily allowances (IJ) and constitute a replacement income for employees who are off work.

The ''benefit in kind'' is the total or partial reimbursement by the health insurance scheme of all or part of the healthcare costs incurred as a result of illness, maternity or an accident at work.
