'''Social protection''' refers to all the protection mechanisms granted by a society to its members to enable them to cope with the social risks of life and their financial consequences.

Social risks'' are situations likely to compromise the financial security of an individual or his family by causing a fall in resources or an increase in expenditure (old age, illness, unemployment, family responsibilities, etc.).

'''Four approaches to social protection coexist:''' the ''compulsory social insurance approach'' aims to protect insured persons against loss of income due to social risks. Social insurance is based on transfer mechanisms of the contribution/benefit type: social benefits are financed by social contributions deducted from income and are reserved for those who pay contributions or their beneficiaries. The "social assistance logic" allows solidarity to be established between individuals to combat poverty and exclusion. The benefit provides a minimum income and does not necessarily cover a specific risk (for example, in the context of what are known as minimum social benefits, such as the revenu de solidarité active [RSA], the allocation adulte handicapé [AAH] or the fonds de solidarité vieillesse [FSV]). '''The logic of universal protection''' covers certain categories of expenditure for all individuals. Benefits are granted without means-testing and are identical for everyone (as in the case of family benefits). The ''individual protection logic'' is based on savings (e.g. the decision to buy dental implants) and private insurance, while ''collective protection'' is based on the pooling of risks.
