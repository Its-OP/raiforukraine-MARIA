The insured person may be exempted from the co-payment for care that complies with the ALD protocol according to the list of 30 long-term conditions defined by the health insurance scheme [[Protocole de soins ALD avec exonération du ticket modérateur 2C-019-DE-A08#%20ftn1|[1]]. Expenses relating to care directly linked to the ALD are reimbursed at 100% by the health insurance. In the case of a '''serious or incapacitating form of a disease not on the list of 30 ALD'', involving a '''prolonged treatment of a foreseeable duration of more than six months and a particularly costly therapy''' ''(31<sup>e</sup> disease for''' care in accordance with the ALD protocol off the list). Finally, in the event of a ''polypathology causing a disabling condition and requiring continuous care for a foreseeable period of more than 6 months'', an exemption from co-payment may be granted for care in accordance with the disabling polypathology protocol (''32<sup>e</sup> maladie'').

In order to "establish an ALD care protocol", the attending physician accompanies the patient's request. In consultation with the specialists involved, he or she draws up the care protocol, which sets out the "diagnostic elements, prescribed treatments, specialist consultations or paraclinical examinations necessary for the patient's care". The care protocol must comply with HAS recommendations and receive the opinion of the health insurance medical officer. A copy of the care protocol is given to the patient, who reads it, signs it and is free to accept or refuse that the diagnosis of the disease be included.

Each doctor who provides care to this patient, whether in a hospital or in a health care establishment, is required to ''write his prescriptions on a bizone prescription in order to distinguish prescriptions relating to the ALD (exemption from co-payment) from those relating to other conditions (application of co-payment)''.

The patient benefits from direct access to the specialists mentioned in the care protocol. In return for the advantage of exemption from co-payment, patients are obliged to present their "personal section of the care protocol" to all professionals they consult, except in emergencies. They must comply with the treatment plan drawn up by the treating doctor and attend the medical check-ups and visits organised by the health insurance scheme.
