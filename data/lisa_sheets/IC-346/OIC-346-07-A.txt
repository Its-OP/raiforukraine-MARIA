- In the case of a symptomatic seizure, the prognosis depends on the cause (meningitis, encephalitis, shaken baby syndrome).

- In the event of a febrile seizure, even a complex one, the prognosis is good (no neurological sequelae), with a greater risk of recurrence in the case of complex febrile seizures.

o Specialist advice if a complex febrile crisis or very high parental anxiety

o Listening to and informing parents

o Prescription of intra-rectal diazepam and explanation of its use

o No preventive treatment for febrile seizures

- In the event of a seizure without fever and no cause found, specialist advice should be sought on suspicion of incipient epilepsy.
