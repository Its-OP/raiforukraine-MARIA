- Make sure it is an epileptic seizure (see differential diagnoses).

- If the child has no known epilepsy

o Is he feverish?

ยง If yes: is it a seizure symptomatic of a nervous system infection or a seizure triggered by fever?

ยง If no: are there any other factors that could cause a seizure, in particular [[Head injury SD-172|head injury]], [[Hypoglycaemia in adults and children|hypoglycaemia]]...?

o If there is no evidence of an acute symptomatic seizure: is this the onset of [[Childhood and adult epilepsy|epilepsy]]?

- Causes of febrile seizures

o Febrile seizure (seizure triggered by a rise in body temperature - often a family history of individual susceptibility to fever)

o Neuromeningeal infection: [[Meningitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess in adults and children|bacterial meningitis]] complicated, [[Infectious meningitis and meningoencephalitis in adults and paediatrics, brain abscess 2C-151-DE-A01|herpetic encephalitis]]

o More rarely [[malaria|neuromalaria]] (depending on context), thrombophlebitis

- Causes of seizures without fever

o Traumatic brain injury (in particular [[head injury SD-172|subdural haematoma]])

o Metabolic disorders (especially before 6 months): [[Hypoglycaemia in adults and children|hypoglycaemia]], hypocalcaemia

o Stroke (young children)

o Onset of epilepsy
