- term "convulsion" = seizures of a [[Epilepsy in children and adults|epileptic]] nature with motor signs <> epileptic absences = no motor signs

- Diagnosis based on questioning (seizure over at the time of consultation) - can be helped by video (to be advised to parents if repeated manifestations)

- the importance of being able to describe the symptoms observed

- recognise the different types of generalised or focal seizures

- gather background information (history, head injury, infection, fever, etc.)

- look for arguments for differential diagnoses (spasm of the sob, shivering, tremors, vagal syncope, sleep myoclonus)
