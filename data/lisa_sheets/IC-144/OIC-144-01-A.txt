==Normal grief==
This is a normal emotional, cognitive and behavioural process in response to the death of a loved one, the aim of which is to come to terms with the loss. It varies according to the individual's culture. It lasts 2 to 3 months, sometimes longer depending on the closeness of the bond with the deceased, their age and the context of the death. It evolves spontaneously towards improvement.

It comprises three types of reaction which are superimposed or follow one another:

*Shock, denial of loss
*Sadness, [[Sad mood/moral pain SD-123|moral pain]]
*Feeling of absence with lack, anger, anxiety, perplexity.
*A reorganisation corresponding to the acceptance of the loss and a reinvestment in daily life in the absence of the deceased.

<Behaviour can help the grieving process by channelling emotions, organising memories, adapting to the loss and giving meaning to life without the deceased.

==Pathological bereavement==
Bereavement can become pathological if the mourning process does not progress towards appeasement (persistent complex bereavement) or if a psychiatric disorder occurs.

===Persistent complex grief; Diagnostic criteria (from DSM 5)===

*Death of a loved one
*Sad mood/emotional pain SD-123|Intense sadness, emotional pain]], preoccupation with the deceased or their death.
*Difficulty in accepting the death, avoidance of anything reminiscent of the death ([[Anxiety SD-116|anxiety]])
*Social or identity rupture: [[Suicidal ideation or behaviour/self-inflicted injury SD-125|suicidal ideation]] to join the deceased, distrust, loss of meaning.
*These symptoms do not correspond to the individual's culture.
*Psychosocial dysfunction
*Duration of more than 12 months (6 months in children)
