== Normal bereavement
It is necessary to accompany the bereaved. The principles of medical consultation are :

* Empathetic listening
* Do not medicalise normal bereavement, but carefully rule out persistent complex bereavement beforehand.
* Rule out a major depressive episode or other psychiatric disorder
* Assess the [[Suicidal ideation or behaviour/self-harm SD-125|suicidal risk]]
* To provide information on the normal grieving process, particularly the reorganisation phase.
* Inform them of the benefits of sharing their grief (close social network, support associations).
* Supportive psychotherapy
* Do not prescribe antidepressants
* Prescribe a hypnotic/anxiolytic SD-256|Anxiolytic or hypnotic treatments]] often ineffective for sleep disturbance in this context.
* Set up monitoring to support and assess the different phases of bereavement and the internal and external resources for managing stress and loss.

<br />

== Persistent complex grief ==

* Carrying out a full clinical examination (particularly cardiovascular)
* Cognitive and behavioural psychotherapy (CBT) (see item 70)

== Characteristic depressive episode

* Systematic assessment of the [[Patient at risk of suicide SD-309|risque suicidaire]]

<br />
