''Principle of the shared medical decision model:''

Shared decision-making is characterised by a two-way exchange of information (presentation of available scientific data, and collection of the patient's values and preferences), followed by deliberation to reach a mutually agreed decision.


The shared decision-making model differs from the paternalistic model (unidirectional exchange of information from doctor to patient and decision made by the doctor alone) and the informative model (unidirectional exchange of information from doctor to patient and decision made by the patient alone).


The shared medical decision model is part of a patient-centred approach to improving respect for patients and their participation in decisions concerning their health.


''Decision support tools:''

Doctors can use decision aids (various media such as leaflets, websites, videos, etc.) to explain the decision to be made, provide information on the options available (the benefits and risks of each), help patients express their values, and facilitate the decision-making process.


''Clinical situations concerned:''

Some situations are less amenable to shared medical decision-making: life-threatening emergencies, treatments that are essential or contraindicated, options that outweigh others in terms of the benefit-risk balance.
