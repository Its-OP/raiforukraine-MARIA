It is recommended that drug prescriptions should be adapted on a personalised basis (according to the patient and their illness), but also according to the characteristics of the drug itself.


''Patient-related characteristics to be taken into account when prescribing:''

- Age

- Gender (particularly risks associated with women of childbearing age: current or planned pregnancy)

- BMI

- Ethnicity/race (for certain specific metabolisms)

- Comorbidities and current treatments

- Renal function, liver function

- Allergies

- Socio-economic level (drug price and reimbursement level)

- Level of literacy (good understanding of prescriptions)

- Burden of treatment (which can compromise compliance)

- Habits: diet, smoking, alcohol, other toxic substances

- Risk of self-medication


''Disease-related characteristics to be taken into account when prescribing:''

- Certainty or uncertainty about the health problem to be treated

- Therapeutic objective (symptomatic, curative, preventive, substitutive or diagnostic treatment)


''Characteristics of the chosen medicine to be taken into account when prescribing:''

- Prescription within the scope of the drug's MA, a RTU, or outside the MA

- Level of evidence on its benefit-risk balance (phase 3 assessment by randomised controlled trial?)

- Indications, contraindications, precautions for use, expected side effects

- Therapeutic margin

- Bioavailability, half-life, elimination routes (renal/digestive)

- Choosing the most appropriate galenic formulation

- Drug interactions, interactions with food


''Factors to be taken into account when prescribing and information to be provided to the patient:''

- Nature of the pathology

- Purpose of treatment and expected benefits

- Duration of treatment, whether or not it can be stopped without medical advice

- Distribution of daily doses and method of administration

- Any associated measures (salt-free diet, photo-protection, etc.)

- Monitoring treatment and pathology

- How to contact the doctor/what to do in the event of an adverse reaction
