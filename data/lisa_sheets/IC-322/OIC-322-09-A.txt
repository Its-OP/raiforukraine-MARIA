== Principles of the pre-anaesthetic consultation 2C-322-PC-A09'' ==
The decree of 5 December 1994 makes it compulsory to have a pre-anaesthetic consultation before any procedure requiring anaesthesia, whether locoregional or general. In the case of a scheduled operation, this consultation must be carried out by an anaesthetist-intensive care doctor at least 48 hours before the operation.

The consultation includes questioning and a clinical examination of the patient, and any additional tests that may be prescribed. It enables the peri- and post-operative risks to be assessed (with the help, if necessary, of additional tests or specialist advice), the patient's usual treatments to be modified, and the peri-operative strategy to be defined (type of anaesthetic, transfusion, antibiotic prophylaxis, monitoring, allergy management, etc.) and the post-operative strategy to be defined (analgesia, possible outpatient treatment, place of hospitalisation, etc.).

It enables clear, appropriate and intelligible information to be given, possibly supported by documents concerning the anaesthetic strategy envisaged and any risks. All these elements are grouped together in the anaesthesia record, which is kept in the patient's medical file.

The anaesthetic consultation is the ideal time to anticipate the therapeutic changes required for the surgical and anaesthetic procedure and to inform the patient of the details of these therapeutic changes.

The anaesthetic consultation does not dispense with or replace the need for a pre-anaesthetic visit in the hours prior to the operation (decree of 20 October 2018). ''In fine'', this pre-anaesthetic visit will make it possible to check that these modifications have indeed been made.
