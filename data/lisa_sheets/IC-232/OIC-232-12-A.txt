'''Assessment of bleeding risk''' in the setting of AF:

*Various clinical scores are available, including the HAS-BLED score.

*Assessment of the risk of haemorrhage has no place in the decision to institute anti-thrombotic treatment: a high HAS BLED score is not in itself a contraindication to anticoagulant treatment.

*Assessing the risk of haemorrhage makes it possible to identify patients at risk so that they can be monitored more closely''.
