* aroxystic AF: return to ''spontaneous'' sinus rhythm, i.e. without electrical or pharmacological cardioversion, in ''less than 7 days''.
* P''''ersistent AF: return to sinus rhythm, with or without therapeutic action, '''beyond 7 days'''.
* Permanent AF : AF for which the aim of the therapeutic strategy is '''not to return to sinus rhythm''.
