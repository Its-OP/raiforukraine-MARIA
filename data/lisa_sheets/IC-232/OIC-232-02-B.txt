Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular rhythm disorder secondary to :

*Focal ectopic activity in the pulmonary veins
*Atrial remodelling, characterised by atrial dilatation and fibrosis, which can facilitate reentry arrhythmias.

'''Ventricular response to atrial fibrillation'''

*The atrio-ventricular node is physiologically the only structure providing an electrical connection between the atrial and ventricular stages.
*The atrio-ventricular node filters out anarchic and rapid atrial activity (400 to 600 bpm), resulting in an irregular ventricular response of variable frequency depending on the patient.
