'''Particular ECG presentations''' may be encountered:

*AF with wide QRS, in case of :
**Organic bundle branch block
**Functional bundle branch block = conduction aberration: bundle branch block occurring only at high ventricular frequencies.

*large mesh AF'': not to be confused with atrial flutter
*AF with BAV 3'': the ECG characteristics are shown in the figure below.
