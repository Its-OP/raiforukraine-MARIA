Patients with AF may be ''asymptomatic'', which explains the importance of screening patients at risk.

The classic symptoms that can be associated with AF are :

* Palpitations
* Dyspnoea
* ''''asthenia

Some less frequent symptoms are present in AF:

* Chest pain
* Fatigability: poor exercise tolerance
* Malaise and syncope

AF may be discovered when one of its complications occurs (stroke, heart failure).
