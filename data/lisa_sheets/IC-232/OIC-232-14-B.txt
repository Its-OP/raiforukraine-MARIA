# Anti-thrombotic strategy

[[File:Anti-thrombotic strategy.png|centric|thumb|900x900px]]

* Antiplatelet agents have no place in AF.

* Indication for percutaneous closure of the left atrium :
** High thromboembolic risk: '''CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc Â³ 4''''
** '''ET'''
** '''Formal and permanent contraindication''' '''to oral anticoagulants'''''

'''2. Rhythm control strategy'''

Objective: To achieve and maintain a return to sinus rhythm.

Thromboembolic risk management for cardioversion :

Before cardioversion, one of the 3 conditions must be validated:

* Effective anticoagulation for 3 weeks
* Trans-oesophageal echocardiography (TEE) performed
* Recent AF (less than 48 hours old)

'''After cardioversion''', effective anticoagulation for 4 weeks is required, regardless of the '''CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score.'''

The anti-thrombotic agents available are :

* Unfractionated heparins (UFH), administered by IVSE or SC, with possible relay with anti-vitamin K therapy (VKA).
* Direct oral anticoagulants (Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban, Apixaban): preferred.
* Low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are not approved for this indication.

'''Characteristics of anti-arrhythmic treatments''' :

'''Ablation of atrial fibrillation:'''

* Transcutaneous endocavitary treatment via the femoral venous route

* 2 energies available for ablation:
** Cryotherapy (cold ablation)
** Radiofrequency (heat ablation)

* 2 areas/strategies for AF ablation :
** Pulmonary vein isolation
** Atrial substrate ablation

'''3. Frequency control strategy'''

Goal: Decrease ventricular response rate with a mean heart rate <110 bpm.

The effectiveness and tolerance of frequency control can be assessed by carrying out a follow-up ''Holter-ECG''.
