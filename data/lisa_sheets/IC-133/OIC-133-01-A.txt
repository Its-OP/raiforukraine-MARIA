Differentiating the concepts of autonomy and functional dependence


- '''Autonomy''': Autonomy refers to the ability, freedom and right to establish one's own laws and the ability to govern oneself. It encompasses intellectual, cognitive and motor skills. It presupposes the capacity for judgement, i.e. the ability to foresee and choose, as well as the freedom and ability to act, to accept or refuse according to one's judgement.


- Dependency: Dependency is the partial or total inability of a person to carry out the activities of daily life (eating, washing, dressing, etc.) without assistance.
