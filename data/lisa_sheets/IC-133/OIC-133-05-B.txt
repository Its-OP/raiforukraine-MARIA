Knowing the risk and precipitating factors in the acquisition of iatrogenic dependence (HAS recommendation)


The main causes of iatrogenic dependence linked to hospitalisation are :

1. immobilisation syndrome

2. acute confusion

3. undernutrition

4. falls

5. de novo urinary incontinence

6. adverse drug reactions

These causes interact with each other and have common risk factors.

The same causes may be found when patients are cared for at home, particularly for causes 3, 4 and 6, which may lead to iatrogenic treatment.
