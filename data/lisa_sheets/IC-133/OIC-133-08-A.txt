- '''Reporting to the Public Prosecutor''''

In accordance with the provisions of article 226-14 of the French Penal Code, the doctor may make a report to the Public Prosecutor without the need to obtain the consent of the adult victim who is unable to protect himself; in the case of serious acts requiring appropriate measures for the sole purpose of protecting the victim.


- '''Mandat de protection future'''

Any adult or emancipated minor (principal) who is not the subject of a guardianship or family power of attorney may appoint in advance one or more persons (agent) to represent him or her. On the day when the principal is no longer physically or mentally capable of looking after his or her own interests, the authorised representative will be able to protect the principal's personal and/or property interests.


- '''Habilitation familiale'''

Family authorisation allows a relative (descendant, ascendant, brother or sister, husband or wife, cohabitee, PACS partner) to seek the judge's authorisation to represent a person who is unable to express his or her wishes.


- '''Sauvegarde de justice'''

Safeguard of justice is a short-term legal protection measure that allows an adult to be represented to carry out certain acts. This measure can avoid the need for a guardianship or curatorship, which are more restrictive. The adult retains the exercise of his or her rights, subject to certain exceptions.


- '''Curatelle / curatelle renforc√©e'''

Guardianship is a legal measure designed to protect a person of full age who, although not in a position to act themselves, needs to be advised or supervised in certain acts of civil life. Guardianship is only ordered if it is established that legal protection would provide insufficient protection. There are several degrees of curatorship. The Protection Litigation Judge appoints one or more curators.


- '''Guardianship'''

Guardianship is a legal measure designed to protect an adult and/or all or part of their assets if they are no longer able to look after their own interests. A guardian represents the person in all acts of civil life. The judge may, at any time, list the acts that the person may or may not perform alone, on a case-by-case basis.
