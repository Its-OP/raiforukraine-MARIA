Understanding the components of the GIR score

The discriminant variables used for the GIR score are :

- '''Consistency:''' to converse and/or behave in a way that is logical and sensible in relation to the accepted norms of the society in which you live.

- '''Orientation''': finding your bearings in time, at different times of the day, in places and their contents.

- '''Toilette''': this relates to personal hygiene and is divided into 2 parts:

- Top toilet

- Lower toilet.

- '''Dressing''': this variable includes dressing and undressing and is entered in 3 parts:

- Top trim

- Medium cover

- Bottom trim

- '''Alimentation''': this variable comprises 2 parts:

- Help yourself

- Eating

- '''Urinary and faecal elimination''': ensuring hygiene and elimination with 2 parts corresponding to urinary and faecal elimination.

- ''Transfer, stand up, lie down, sit down'': moving from one of the three positions (lying down, sitting up, standing up) to another, in both directions.

- '''Moving around inside''': inside the home and in institutions within the living environment, including communal areas.

- '''Moving outside''': from the front door without any means of transport.

- '''Remote communication''': remote communication is defined as alerting, i.e. using remote means of communication: telephone, alarm, bell, remote alarm, for the purpose of alerting.

'''Les modalit√©s des variables discriminantes'''

A- '' '' ''' ''''' " done alone, totally, habitually and correctly "''

''B- "done partially or not usually and correctly"''

''C- "does not"''


'''Les groupes Iso-ressources (GIR)'''

An algorithm classifies the combinations of responses to the discriminant variables into 6 Iso-Resource Groups. The iso-resource groups correspond to the most frequent profiles of association of variables. Group 1 corresponds to the most dependent people, while group 6 groups together people who have not lost their autonomy for the discriminating acts of everyday life.
