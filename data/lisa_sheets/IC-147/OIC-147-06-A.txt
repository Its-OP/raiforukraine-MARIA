'''<u>1- [https://www.has-sante.fr/jcms/c_2674284/fr/prise-en-charge-de-la-fievre-chez-l-enfant Indication for antipyretics]</u>'''

- Antipyretics are not routinely used.

- Antipyretics in case of discomfort, or in special cases: cardiac insufficiency, respiratory insufficiency, elderly patients (risk of poor tolerance).

- The antipyretic of choice is Paracetamol: 15 mg/kg 4 times a day in children, maximum 1 gram x4/d in adults "per os" whenever possible. Contraindicated in cases of acute hepatitis or liver failure.

- In children, taking paracetamol should be accompanied by physical measures

- Aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs are not recommended (risk of Reye's syndrome in the case of chickenpox in children, risk of serious loco-regional or systemic complications in the case of bacterial outbreaks, particularly in the skin, ENT or lungs).

- The use of ibuprofen may be discussed in children in the event of persistent discomfort despite paracetamol, following a rigorous clinical assessment in the absence of a bacterial focus and combined with reinforced monitoring.
