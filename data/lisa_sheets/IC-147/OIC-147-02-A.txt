Emergency situations are related either to signs of seriousness, clinical orientation towards an aetiology that is a priori severe and/or to areas at risk of complications.

'''<u>1- Clinical signs of severity</u>''''

'''In adults'''

These are signs of sepsis (sign of organ failure)

- Neurological signs: anxiety, agitation [[Mental confusion/disorientation SD-119|confusion syndrome]], behavioural disorder

- Cardiovascular signs: [[Discovery of arterial hypotension SD-043| systolic BP ≤100 mm Hg]]

- Skin signs: [[Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|purpura]], cold and cyanotic extremities, mottling

- Respiratory signs: polypnoea ≥22/min, draught, thoracoabdominal rocking, superficial polypnoea, SaO2 <90%.

- Renal signs: oliguria <0.5 mL/kg/h, anuria

The quickSOFA (qSOFA) is a rapid assessment score that quickly identifies septic patients at risk of a poor prognosis and requiring transfer to an intensive care unit (qSOFA≥2):

- Systolic blood pressure ≤100mm Hg

- Respiratory rate ≥22/min

- Acute impairment of upper functions

'''In children'''

The signs of seriousness indicate organ failure (sepsis) in haemodynamic, neurological or respiratory terms (as in adults, but sometimes with different expressions) and/or a potentially severe bacterial infection. It is essential to examine the skin for purpura.

- Hemodynamics: (Fc4P)

o '''F'''requence '''c'''ardiaque: tachycardia is the earliest sign,

o '''P'''ression artérielle: hypotension artérielle étant un signe de gravité extrême

o Eripheric ''p'''circulation: signs of peripheral circulatory insufficiency (mottling, coldness of the extremities, elongated CRT)

o '''P'''ouls: thready pulses = extreme severity

o ''P'''recharge: the presence of hepatomegaly is a sign of extreme severity, indicating cardiac failure which may be secondary to sepsis (myocardial damage in ''purpura fulminans'', for example) or endocarditis.

- Neurological :

o importance of parental assessment and concern

o Behaviour and interaction with those around it,

o Consciousness: alert, smiling, drowsy (sometimes difficult to assess in a young infant)

o Meningitis syndrome (see meningitis and specific signs in infants)

! Convulsion (or febrile seizure) is not a sign of seriousness in itself (see specific situations).

- Respiratory

o '''F'''requence: polypnoea

o '''T'''ravail: Respiratory distress, signs of struggle

o '''V'''olume: asymmetric auscultation (purulent pleurisy), superficial acidosis respiration (lactic acidosis in sepsis)

o '''O'''xygenation: desaturation (linked to the cause - severe respiratory infection - or to extreme circulatory failure)

- Cutaneous

o [[Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|Purpura]]: ''purpura fulminans''.

o Diffuse erythema: toxin shock, [[Toxidermia|allergy]]

o Detachment: severe allergy, infections

o Mucosal involvement: allergy, Kawasaki (conjunctivitis, cheilitis)


'''<u>2- Terrain at risk of serious infection and/or unfavourable evolution</u>''''

- '''Infant under 3 months and a fortiori under 6 weeks'''

- ''Pregnant woman'': risk of suffering or even foetal death, spontaneous miscarriage, premature delivery, etc.

- '''Immunosuppression:'''' Deficiency of humoral or cellular immunity, neutropenia, immunosuppressive drugs, cirrhosis, etc.

- '''Comorbidities:''' poorly balanced diabetes, cardiac insufficiency, coronary artery disease, respiratory insufficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, dependent and/or polypathological patients, trisomy 21, patient with foreign material: prosthesis, central catheter, etc.

- The family environment and the possibility of appropriate monitoring are also important factors in the assessment of fever in an infant.


Fever in itself is not a sign of seriousness, but can decompensate a comorbidity by :

- Neurological effects of fever: behavioural problems, convulsions, delirium, etc.

- Dehydration: each degree above 37°c increases water loss by 400mL/d

- Decompensation of an underlying comorbidity: each degree above 37°C increases respiratory rate and heart rate by 10 beats per minute. Fever and chills increase oxygen requirements.


'''<u>3- Special situations</u>''''

- Any fever on return from a trip to an endemic area is malaria until proven otherwise. It is a diagnostic and therapeutic emergency.

- '''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Malignant hyperthermia]]''' is a rare but serious environmental pathology. It is a medical emergency. Its definition is based on the combination of the following elements:  Central temperature above 40°C, neurological signs, absence of evidence in favour of an infectious origin and presence of an identified favouring factor (high age, physical exercise in a hot environment, co-morbidities, medication, etc.).

- ''[[Convulsions in infants and children|Febrile seizure]]''' (formerly called hyperthermic convulsive seizure): common in children (2-5% of children aged 6 months to 5 years). Not directly related to fever, but rather to the associated "inflammatory climate". A prolonged febrile seizure and/or one occurring in a child outside the "classic" age range (under 6 months, over 5 years), presenting signs of haemodynamic, neurological or respiratory severity after the seizure, should raise the suspicion of a neuromeningeal infection.
