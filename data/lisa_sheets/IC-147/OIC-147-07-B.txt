Fever reflects the hypothalamic response (thermoregulatory centre) to tissue aggression. It appears in response to exogenous pyrogenic substances, both microbial and endogenous (cytokines, etc.).

In the case of fever of infectious origin, no relationship has been established between the severity of the fever and the severity of the infection in question.
