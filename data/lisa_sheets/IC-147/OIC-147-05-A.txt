An [[Prescribe an anti-infective SD-255|probabilistic urgent antibiotic therapy]] is indicated even without a clear etiological orientation in cases of :

- Presence of signs of severity (sepsis, septic shock)

- Fever in a neutropenic ([[Blood count interpretation SD-223|neutrophils < 500/m3]]) or asplenic patient

- Suspicion of serious infection (e.g. "purpura fulminans": indication for antibiotic therapy at home, before any samples are taken)

In all other situations, the urgency is to make the diagnosis in order to implement the appropriate treatment, sometimes very quickly after the diagnostic procedure (e.g. purulent meningitis after LP).
