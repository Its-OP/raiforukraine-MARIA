=== At population level: ===
           - '''Santé publique France:''' publication of international and national data (emergency room visits and cluster cases)

- '''GrippeNet.fr:''' collects epidemiological data on influenza from the general public anonymously over the internet.

=== In ambulatory medicine: ===
- '''Le réseau Sentinelle :''' clinical and virological surveillance of influenza syndromes in outpatient medicine

=== In hospitals: ===
- '''Oscour network:''' monitoring of the number of influenza-related hospital admissions and hospitalisations from the hospital network of emergency departments

- Number of admissions to intensive care units

- '''Renal-CNR network:''' virological surveillance

=== At national level: ===
- '''CepiDC''' & '''INSEE''' collect data on influenza-related deaths. The validity of these figures is difficult to establish, depending on the cause of death (influenza or its complications, or decompensation of an underlying pathology).
