Contagion is essentially human-to-human and seasonal (November to February). Transmission is direct by air, via airborne droplets of Pfl√ºge expelled when coughing or sneezing.

The subject is contagious 1 day before and up to 6 days after the onset of symptoms.

Waterfowl, the reservoir of the influenzae A virus, can transmit the virus via their droppings.
