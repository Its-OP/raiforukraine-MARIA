- Enveloped RNA viruses

- Orthomyxoviridae family

- Genus of Myxovirus influenzae

- Three types A, B and C

- Types A and B responsible for seasonal epidemics in humans

- Group A majority

- Type C are only responsible for sporadic cases


Type A and B viruses are separated into several subtypes on the basis of two surface proteins:

- Haemagglutinin (H1 to H17)

- Neuraminidase (N1 to N9)


Type A and B viruses vary regularly as a result of changes to their RNA through two mutation mechanisms (breaks and slips).
