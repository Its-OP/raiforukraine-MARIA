==Biological tests
o CBC, with blood smear analysis

o C-reactive protein (acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP))''''

o Serum protein electrophoresis

o Blood ionogram, creatinine, calcium levels

o Transaminases, gammaGT, alkaline phosphatases, bilirubin

o Creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH)

o TSHus (thyroid-stimulating hormone ultra-sensitive)

o Activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, fibrinogen

o Ferritin

o Anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibodies

o Proteinuria (ratio of proteinuria to creatininuria, based on a urine sample)
<br />

==Microbiological tests
o Blood cultures (x 3), before any antibiotic treatment

o Urine cytobacteriological examination

o Epstein Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologies (and others depending on epidemiology).  

==''In second line or according to clinical context'''==
o Digestive endoscopy

o Temporal artery biopsy if > 50 years old


'''In children as first-line treatment at D7'''

Biological and microbiological tests

- CBC, CRP, fibrinogen, VS, HAA, iono ASAT ALAT ALAT, ferritin

- Blood cultures

- EBV, CMV, parvovirus serology

- BU (with leucocytes and proteinuria) + ECBU

'''- Morphological examinations:'''' Chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound, cardiac ultrasound

If the fever persists beyond this point without any obvious explanation, a paediatric specialist opinion is required (= for the 3rd cycle).
