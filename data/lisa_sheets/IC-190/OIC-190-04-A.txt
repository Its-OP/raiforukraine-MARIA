'''In children'''

'''Frequent infections'''

/A distinction must be made between prolonged fever and repeated fevers, the latter being by far the most frequent and may correspond to a series of viral infections. Careful attention must therefore be paid to the notion of a free interval and to associated respiratory signs suggestive of viral infection

Viral: EBV, CMV

Parasites: toxoplasmosis, malaria (recurrence)

Bacterial: tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, Bartonellosis (systemic form more common than in adults)


'''Rarer infections'''

Viral infections: HIV

Bacterial infections: osteoarticular infections, deep abscesses, endocarditis (rarer than in adults)

Much rarer: Rickettsial disease, coxiellosis, chlamydiosis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections (extra pulmonary form), typhoid fever, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis A, B and E, Whipple's disease, etc.
