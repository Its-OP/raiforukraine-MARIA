'''The reference diagnostic examination is oeso-gastroduodenal endoscopy with biopsy'' (to be prescribed as soon as dysphagia appears, particularly in a subject at risk)


Assessment of general and nutritional status (WHO performans status, weight loss kinetics, serum albumin, renal and liver function)

Assessment of cardiac function (cardiac ultrasound, ejection fraction) and respiratory function (EFR)


'''If Epidermoid:''''

- Search for a second ENT and bronchial cancer (ex ENT, bronchoscopy) - same risk factors

- Assessment of extension :

o Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan with injection of contrast product (+ cervical if location in the upper 1/3 of the oesophagus)

o 18-FDG PET scan (in addition to the CT scan to confirm the absence of metastasis before curative treatment)

o Endoscopic oesophageal ultrasound if the lesion is small and can be crossed endoscopically, in particular to confirm that it is superficial before treatment by endoscopic resection.

'''If adenocarcinoma:'''

- Assessment of extension :

o Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan with injection of contrast medium

o Endoscopic oesophageal ultrasound if the lesion is small and can be crossed endoscopically, in particular to confirm that it is superficial before treatment by endoscopic resection.
