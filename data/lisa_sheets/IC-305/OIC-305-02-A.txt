'''Squamous cell carcinoma'''

- Tobacco and alcohol are the two main risk factors.

Other circumstances expose patients to the risk of squamous cell carcinoma many years after the event

- Caustic or post-radiation oesophagitis (mediastinal radiotherapy)

- Achalasia


'''Adenocarcinoma'''

- Chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a risk factor when it is complicated by Barrett's mucosa or EndoBrachyOesophagus (EBO). A precancerous condition in which the squamous mucosa of the lower oesophagus is replaced by glandular mucosa (intestinal metaplasia). OBC develops in 10-20% of people with chronic GERD. Within this OCT, foci of dysplasia, "in situ" cancer and then invasive cancer may develop.

- Overweight (itself a factor in GERD), BMI > 25 kg/m2

- The male sex

- Tobacco consumption
