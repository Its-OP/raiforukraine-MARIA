'''Systemic vasculitis''': conditions characterised by '''inflammatory damage to arterial, capillary and/or venous blood vessels'' leading to damage to the vascular wall.

Classified according to the calibre of the vessels affected:

* Large-calibre vessels (aorta and its dividing branches),
* Medium-calibre vessels (main visceral arteries and their dividing branches),
* small-calibre vessels (arterioles, capillaries and venules).
