'''<big>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA):</big>''' autoantibodies directed against neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (GPA, MPA and GEPA, specificity 95%)

Detection by indirect immunofluorescence :

* neutrophil cytoplasmic fluorescence (c-ANCA), with anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) specificity (GPA)
* perinuclear fluorescence of neutrophils (p-ANCA), with anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) specificity (MPA and GEPA)

Differential diagnosis: ANCA may be present in infectious diseases, in particular infectious endocarditis or tuberculosis.

'''<big>Cryoglobulinemias</big>''''

Immunoglobulins precipitate at temperatures below 37°C

* type I cryoglobulins: isolated monoclonal immunoglobulin (lymphoid haemopathies)
* Mixed cryoglobulins: at least two varieties of immunoglobulin (type II with a monoclonal component, or type III with only polyclonal immunoglobulins (chronic hepatitis C, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoid haemopathies).
