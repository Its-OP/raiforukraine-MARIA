'''<big>Biological examinations:</big>''''

* inflammatory syndrome ("acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome" SDD-186| "acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome"), "C-reactive protein elevation" SDD-203|)
* viral serologies: hepatitis C, hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

'''<big>Imaging examinations:</big>''' oriented according to the clinical context

* Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with injection of iodinated contrast (aortitis, microaneurysms, pulmonary and digestive lesions)
* CT of the sinuses
* Depending on the context: arterial echo-doppler, angio-MRI or positron emission tomography (PET-CT) to visualise vascular axes.

'''<big>Biopsies with anatomopathological analysis:</big>''' to be performed on target organs ([[Inflammatory reaction on surgical specimen/biopsy SDD-179|'''inflammatory reaction on surgical specimen/biopsy''']], [[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SDD-180|'''interpretation of an anatomopathology report''']]):
