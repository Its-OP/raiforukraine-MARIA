==Main types of systemic vasculitis (Figure 1):==

*Vasculitis of large-calibre arteries: giant cell arteritis (formerly Horton's disease) and Takayasu's arteritis,
*Vasculitis of medium-calibre arteries: ''periarteritis nodosa'' and ''Kawasaki disease'',
*Vasculitides of small-calibre vessels:
**associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA): granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA); granulomatosis with eosinophilia and polyangiitis (GEPA); microscopic polyangiitis (MPA),
**associated with deposits of immune complexes: ''cryoglobulinemic vasculitis'', ''IgA vasculitis'' (formerly known as rheumatoid purpura), ''hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis'' or vasculitis with anti-C1q antibodies (formerly known as MacDuffie syndrome),
**associated with linear immunoglobulin deposits: '''vasculitis with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies'' (MBG; formerly Goodpasture's syndrome).
