==Description:==

*Biological work-up updated if more than 5 years old: CBC, blood ionogram, creatinine levels, liver function tests, etc.
*Cardiovascular risk factors are investigated: lipid profile, fasting blood glucose +/- glycated haemoglobin if diabetes is known.
*If there is a suspicion of [[Menopause, premature ovarian failure, andropause, age-related androgen deficiency|androgen deficiency 124]], a total and bioavailable testosterone level is prescribed (asthenia, decreased libido, testicular atrophy, abnormal sweating, [[Gynecomastia|gynecomastia 246]]).
*In the case of androgen deficiency, a gonadotropin assay should be performed, as well as a prolactin assay in the case of pituitary deficiency.
*A serum TSH assay may be prescribed if there are suggestive signs (hypo- or hyperthyroidism).
*Serum PSA is measured if there are associated mictional disorders or if androgen replacement therapy is being considered.
*Recent erectile dysfunction in a man with cardiovascular risk factors or metabolic syndrome requires a cardiological opinion (coronary artery disease).
