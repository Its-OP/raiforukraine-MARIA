== Description : ==

*Erection is due to an influx of blood into the sinusoidal spaces of the cavernous bodies of the penis. These sinusoidal spaces are lined with endothelial cells.
*This phenomenon is caused by the relaxation of smooth muscle cells in response to a nerve impulse.
*The erectile centres are medullary, with a vegetative balance between parasympathetic stimulation (sacral medulla) and sympathetic inhibition (thoracolumbar medulla).
*These vegetative pathways pass through the inferior hypogastric plexuses from which the cavernous nerves arise, carrying impulses to the smooth muscle cells of the cavernous bodies of the penis.
*The so-called "reflex" erection corresponds to the medullary response to a sensory genital stimulus.
*Psychogenic" erection corresponds to a sensory or phantasmatic stimulus, therefore of supramedullary origin.
*Nocturnal" erections occur during REM sleep.
