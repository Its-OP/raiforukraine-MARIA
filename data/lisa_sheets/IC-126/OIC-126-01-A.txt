==Description:==

*Erectile dysfunction is the inability, for at least 3 months, to obtain or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual activity.
*Psychogenic causes include psychiatric, psychological, socio-affective, reactionary (positive or negative life events) and situational causes (performance anxiety). Nocturnal erections are generally retained.
*Organic causes refer to damage to the organs or tissues involved in erection. It includes neurological, vascular, hormonal, cavernous and iatrogenic causes. It generally affects nocturnal erections.
*Hormonal causes combine a drop in libido with erectile dysfunction.
*A mixed cause is common and means that any organic cause must be ruled out when there is a predominantly psychogenic cause, and that performance anxiety may aggravate an organic cause.
