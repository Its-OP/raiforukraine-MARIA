== Description : ==

*Lapeyronie's disease 50 is a benign condition characterised by localised fibrosis of the albuginea of the corpora cavernosa. It is painful during the inflammatory phase and, in the healing phase, leaves palpable painless patches on the penis associated with angulation of the penis during erection, which may hinder or prevent sexual intercourse.
*It usually affects men over the age of 50.
*Diagnosis is clinical: questioning, palpation of patches, measurement of angulation on photographs of the erect penis.
*The functional (erectile dysfunction, difficulty with intromission) and psychological repercussions must be assessed.
