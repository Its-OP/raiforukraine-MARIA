== Description : ==

*Venous", veno-occlusive or low-flow priapism is painful. The glans is flaccid. It is a urological emergency because it is ischaemic and can lead to sequelae of fibrosis and therefore erectile dysfunction. This is the most common type of priapism.
*Arterial" or high-flow priapism is rare, non-ischaemic and typically painless, with a "soft" tumescence/erection and discomfort. It is due to an arteriocavernous fistula, often following pelvic trauma.
*Priapism in sickle cell disease is a haematological emergency and indicates a sickle cell crisis.
