==Description:==

*Questioning (chronology, circumstances of onset, co-morbidities: diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2 in children and adults. Complications|diabetes 247]], cardiovascular disease or signs, psycho-affective context, nocturnal/midnight erections) suggests a psychogenic and/or organic cause. The reduction or disappearance of nocturnal/matine erections suggests an organic cause.
*Questioning looks for [[Menopause, premature ovarian failure, andropause, age-related androgen deficiency|lowered libido 124]] in favour of hypogonadism.
*Questioning looks for medical treatments (beta-blockers, anti-hypertensives, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors) or surgical treatments (rectal, aortic, [[Benign prostatic hypertrophy|prostatic 127]] and [[Tumours of the prostate|310]]) that may have an impact on erections, consumption of [[Tobacco addiction|tobacco 75]], alcohol [[Addiction to psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines and related) (see item 321)|76]] or [[Addiction to cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, synthetic drugs (see item 321)|drug 77]] and [[Addiction to cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, synthetic drugs (see item 322)|78]].
*Self-questionnaires can be used to assess the severity of erectile dysfunction, but active, unprejudiced listening is needed to assess the impact on quality of life and life as a couple.
*Physical examination (urogenital: penis, testicles, digital rectal examination, hypogonadism, gynaecomastia, cardiovascular, neurological, cardiovascular risk factors and prevention|metabolic syndrome 222) enables the main organic causes to be explored.
*Endothelial dysfunction is the mechanism common to cardiovascular disease and erectile dysfunction of vascular origin: erectile dysfunction may be the "sentinel symptom" of atherosclerosis, which should be detected by a [[Cardiovascular risk factors and prevention|cardiovascular check-up 222]].
