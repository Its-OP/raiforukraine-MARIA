- Accumulation of epithelioid and giganto-cellular granulomas: histological structures formed by epithelioid cells and giant cells from the monocyto-macrophagic lineage, a T lymphocyte infiltrate with a predominance of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and non-constant fibrosis.

- Never caseous necrosis (caseous necrosis = mycobacterial infection)

- Mechanism of granuloma accumulation not known: probably a reaction to one or more environmental antigens (mycobacteria or other bacteria, inert particles) in a predisposed genetic background.

- Presence of CD4 T lymphocytes<sup>+</sup> in the organs but circulating CD4 T lymphopenia<sup>+</sup> (responsible for tuberculin anergy)
