=='''In all patients'''==
- '''[[Request for an imaging examination SDD-231|Chest imaging]]''' (chest X-ray and/or thoracic computed tomography (CT)) systematically at diagnosis, and repeated during follow-up (chest X-ray, or even thoracic CT but more radiating).

*abnormal in 90% of cases
*mainly mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, bilateral, symmetrical and non-compressive
*interstitial syndrome predominantly in the upper lobes, with a predominance of lymphatically distributed micronodules, and sometimes fibrosis.
*'''5 stages''' (with prognostic value) on a standing chest X-ray
**'''Stage 0:'''' Normal chest X-ray
**Stage I:'''' Bilateral mediastinal and hilar adenopathy without lung parenchymal involvement
**'''Stage II:'''' Mediastinal adenopathy and interstitial involvement
**Stage III:'''' Interstitial involvement without mediastinal adenopathy
**Stage IV:'''' Radiological signs of pulmonary fibrosis


==Depending on clinical signs ==
- Echocardiography and ECG holter at the slightest sign / doubt of cardiac damage

- '''[[Request for an SD-231|CT abdomino-pelvic imaging test]]'''': to identify liver or spleen involvement, or deep adenomegalia

- Positron emission tomography (PET) with <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-CT): limited indications (= useless in all patients) ('''[[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]''')

*search for cardiac damage
*search for a biopsiable target
*certain stages IV, in particular to look for signs of disease activity
*identification of sarcoidosis activity in the presence of non-specific clinical signs (asthenia)

- '''[[Request for an imaging examination SD-231|Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)]]''' cerebral, cardiac, spinal cord

- Electromyogram (if peripheral neurological damage)
