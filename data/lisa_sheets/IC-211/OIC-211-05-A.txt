- All organs can be affected

- Strong predilection for the lungs and lymph nodes ('''[[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]]'''), particularly intra-thoracic = 90% of patients

- Rare general signs (except Löfgren's syndrome)

==Löfgren's syndrome ==
- Acute, inflammatory form of sarcoidosis

- Association of

- Fever

- Erythema nodosum with arthralgia ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]''') or arthritis of the ankles

- Bilateral mediastinal and hilar adenopathy

- Histological documentation not essential

- Excellent prognosis (90% cure).

==''Erythema nodosum (skin lesion)'''==
- Non-specific septal hypodermatitis

- Diagnosis: Subcutaneous erythema SD-085|erythematous nodules]''', firm, painful, located on the extensor surfaces of the legs and forearms, most often opposite the tibial crests near the knees, corresponding to acute inflammatory dermohypodermatitis.

- Biopsy not necessary (non-specific and clinical diagnosis)

- Several possible outbreaks

- Healing of lesions in a few weeks without scarring

- Sarcoidosis: leading cause of erythema nodosum in France (as part of Löfgren's syndrome)

- Other possible causes of erythema nodosum: streptococcal infections, Behcet's disease, inflammatory diseases of the digestive tract, leprosy, drugs.

==Respiratory disorders ==
- Present in 90% of patients

- Inconsistent symptoms: no symptoms (frequent); '''[[Cough SD-167|cough]]''' dry; '''[[Dyspnoea SD-162|dyspnoea]]'''; '''[[Chest pain SD-161|chest pain]]'''.
