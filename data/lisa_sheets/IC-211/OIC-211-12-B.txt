- Histological documentation ('''[[Interpretation of an anatomopathology report SD-180|interpretation of an anatomopathology report]]''') essential for diagnosis (except LÃ¶fgren's syndrome)

- Shows epithelioid granulomas, with giant cells ("giganto-cellular"), without caseous necrosis

- Diagnostic strategies to be aware of: choice of biopsy site on an organ or tissue that is preferably minimally invasive (accessory salivary glands, skin, conjunctival nodules).

- Cost-effectiveness (= ability to show granulomas on a sample) is greater the more the organ is affected clinically, biologically or on imaging.

'''-'''' Bronchial endoscopy with staged spur biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage frequently performed: shows lymphocytic alveolitis, predominantly '''CD4<sup>+</sup>'' T lymphocytes, and possible identification of pathogens (differential diagnosis), and is important for differentiating interstitial involvement in sarcoidosis from other interstitial lung diseases.

- Hilar adenopathy: echo-endoscopic cytopuncture preferred to mediastinoscopy (less invasive)
