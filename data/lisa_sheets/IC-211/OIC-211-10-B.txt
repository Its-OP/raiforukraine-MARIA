==''Possible biological signs associated with sarcoidosis (inconstant and non-specific)'''==

*lymphopenia ('''[[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|leukocyte abnormality]]''') (without increased risk of infection)
*polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia ('''[[Serum protein electrophoresis analysis SD-193|serum protein electrophoresis analysis]]''')
*elevation of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), non-specific, present in only 50% of cases
*'''hypercalcaemia ([[Dyscalcaemia SD-200|dyscalcaemia]]) and hypercalciuria,''' a consequence of the synthesis of 1-alpha hydroxylase by granulomas.
*'''[[Cholestasis SD-198|cholestasis]]''' and/or hepatic cytolysis in the case of hepatic damage
*increase in creatinine in the case of renal damage
*no specific biological marker for sarcoidosis

<br />

==''Other useful biological tests'''==

*hepatitis B, C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologies (secondary granulomatoses and for pre-therapeutic purposes)
