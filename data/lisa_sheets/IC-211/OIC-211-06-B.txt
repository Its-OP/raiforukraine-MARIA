'''<u>Main extra-respiratory manifestations</u>''''

- Organs affected in more than 10% of patients: skin, eyes, liver, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, ENT.

- All other conditions are rare.

<br />

== '''Skin lesions''' ''([[SD-084-Skin lesion/"mole"|skin lesion]])'' (excluding erythema nodosum)==
- Sarcoid: lesions of variable size, infiltrated

- Simple, cost-effective biopsy sites (biopsy of infiltrated areas)

- Predilection for traumatised areas (scars ('''[[SD-083-Annormal scar|abnormal scar]]'''), tattoos)

- Lupus pernio: rare but with a poor prognosis (chronic and severe forms of sarcoidosis); skin involvement of the face (purplish patches on the nose and cheeks in the shape of butterfly wings) and extremities (NB: no link with lupus except for the fact that it affects the face).

==Ophthalmological disease ==
- Uveitis ('''[[SD-152-Red and/or painful eye|red and/or painful eye]]''')

- Most often anterior, but can affect all sectors

- Uni or bilateral

==ENT disease ==
- Frustrating clinical signs (nasal obstruction) or more marked signs (epistaxis, crusting)

- Poor prognostic value.

==Hepato-splenic disease ==
- Most often asymptomatic

'''- Mainly biological diagnosis: [[SD-198-Cholestase|Cholestase]]''' or cytolysis in the case of liver damage

- '''[[SD-058-Splenomegaly|Splenomegaly]]''' or '''[[SD-006-Hepatomegaly|hepatomegaly]]''' clinical or imaging (sometimes nodular in appearance on imaging)

<br />

== '''Peripheral lymph nodes''' ('''[[SD-016-Single or multiple lymph nodes|single or multiple lymph nodes]]'''')==
- Any territory, including epitrochlear (suggestive)

- Easy biopsy site

- Classically non-compressive.
<br />

==Central and peripheral nervous system disorders ==
- Rare (< 5% of patients)

- All nerve structures can be affected

- With or without meningitis (usually lymphocytic and may be hypoglycorrhagic)

- Cranial nerves frequently affected, particularly peripheral ''[[SD-127-Facial paralysis|facial paralysis]]'''.
<br />

==Heart disease ==
- Rare (< 5% of patients)

- Serious (cause of death)

- Can cause sudden death

- Conductive or rhythmic disorders

- Must be detected at diagnosis and during follow-up at least by questioning (malaise, palpitations) and an electrocardiogram ''([[SD-185-Realisation and interpretation of an electrocardiogram (ecg)|realisation et interprétation d'un électrocardiogram (ECG)]]'')
<br />

== '''Rheumatological disorders'''==
- '''[[SD-067-Joint Pain|Joint Pain]]''' or polyarthritis possible.
<br />

==Renal impairment ==
- Rare

- Interstitial nephropathy ('''[[SD-199-Enhanced creatinine|Elevation of creatinine]]''')
