CD can affect the entire digestive tract, from the mouth to the anus.

* The most common lesions are ileal or ileocaecal, colonic and anoperineal.     The lesions affect the entire intestinal wall (transmural involvement), which explains complications such as fistulas, abscesses and stenosis, and are most often ''heterogeneous and non-continuous'', both macroscopically and histologically.
* ''Anoperineal involvement'' (30% of patients) may include:

- simple or complex fistulas anal fissures/ulcerations

- anal stenosis.

- marisci (skin growths) which may be oedematous or ulcerated.


UC systematically affects the rectum and may extend more or less far into the colon. Lesions are limited to the mucosa and the superficial part of the submucosa. Involvement is ''continuous, with no interval of healthy mucosa''. There is no involvement of the small intestine or anus. A distinction is made between :

* Rectitis: involvement limited to the rectum,
* Left colitis: involvement not extending beyond the left colonic angle,
* pancolitis: involvement extending beyond the left colonic angle.


From an anatomopathological point of view, there are inflammatory lesions common to both IBDs:

- ulcerations, rarefaction of glands, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate


The anatomopathological lesions suggestive of Crohn's disease are as follows:

- Epithelioid granulomas (and sometimes gigantocellular granulomas, but without caseous necrosis): detected in 30% of cases of Crohn's disease, they are not seen in UC.

- Transmural inflammatory infiltrate in CD (superficial in UC).

Chronic inflammation promotes the development of "intestinal fibrosis", which can progress to stenosis. This is most often seen in the small intestine in CD.

Chronic inflammation is also a ''carcinogenesis factor''. The risk of colorectal cancer is increased in UC and CD, as is that of the small intestine in CD, but much more rarely.
