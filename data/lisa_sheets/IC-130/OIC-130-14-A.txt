Geriatric care must integrate not only the somatic dimension, but also the psychological, functional and social dimensions. It includes prevention. It takes into account acute pathologies and their repercussions on chronic pathologies, and avoids cascading pathologies and iatrogenic dependency.

This is a demanding field of medicine, which requires the best possible care to be established, taking into account scientific data, the wishes of patients and their families, and an assessment of the benefits and risks based on the multidimensional geriatric assessment carried out.

A multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving a range of health professionals including geriatricians, nurses, care assistants, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, pharmacists, etc., and even other medical specialists.
