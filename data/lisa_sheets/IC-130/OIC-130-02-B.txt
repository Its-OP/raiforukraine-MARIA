'''Standardised geriatric assessment = multidimensional assessment + management proposal'''

The standardised geriatric assessment (EGS) is carried out, at best, outside an acute situation, on a stable patient. The assessment is medical, social and functional, and involves several different professions: doctor, nurse/carer, physiotherapist, social worker, occupational therapist, etc.

It provides the most accurate possible description of the various dimensions of the elderly patient. The main dimensions assessed are as follows

- Cognitive functions (Mini-Mental State Examination - MMSE) and risk of confusion (Confusion Assessment Method - CAM)

- Autonomy and functional independence (Activities of Daily Living -ADL, Instrumental ADL IADL)

- Risk of falls (unipodal support, Timed Up & Go)

- Nutritional status (Mini Nutritional Assessment - MNA)

- Depression (Geriatric Depression Scale - GDS)

- Risk of bedsores (Norton or Braden scale)

- Comorbidities, renal function and treatment (creatinine clearance), reconciliation

- Social environment

- Screening for sensory disorders

this assessment stage is inextricably linked with proposals for care management (medication reconciliation, optimising the management of chronic pathologies and undernutrition, adapting the environment and aids....,)
