Frailty is a measurable geriatric syndrome that provides a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability of the elderly. Its definition is based on the presence of at least three of Fried's five criteria.

Frailty is a clinical syndrome characterised by a decline in physiological reserve capacity, altering the mechanisms for adapting to stress. This potentially reversible state is a risk factor for mortality and adverse events (falls, hospitalisation, admission to an institution).
