The care of the elderly cannot be limited to the management of their medical pathologies, whether chronic or acute. It requires a global approach and includes the following elements:

- Diagnose and manage acute and chronic pathologies

- Prevent complications (malnutrition, confusion, falls, functional decline, etc.)

- Assessing the functional impact of these pathologies

- Maintaining patient autonomy

- Adapting the patient's environment as best as possible (social development)

- Include the patient's wishes in this care
