Polymedication is the use of several drugs on a daily basis. Polymedication is defined as more than 5 therapeutic classes. However, while polymedication is a risk factor for adverse drug events, it is above all the therapeutic classes used (in particular antithrombotics, antidiabetics and antihypertensives) or the presence of inappropriate drug prescriptions within the prescription that pose a problem (overuse, misuse, underuse).
