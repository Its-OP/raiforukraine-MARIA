The precipitating factors (3 in the Figure of 1+2+3) are the acute events which cause a break with the previous state and organ decompensation (OAP, confusion, sudden functional decline, fall, etc.).

Among the first reflexes, '''<u>IATROGENIA</u>''' must be sought (very profitable, 1 in 5 elderly patients come to emergency because of their treatments).

'''Non-exhaustive list of precipitating factors:''''

<u>1-Iatrogenicity+++:</u>

These two questions are systematic: "In the week preceding the current situation, did you change or suspend any of your treatments, or start a new medication?"

- Introduction of new treatments

- Treatment withdrawal

- Changes in dosage

- Toxic substances (CO, alcohol, etc.)

<u>2-Acute intercurrent pathologies:</u>

They are sought by questioning (has anything new happened before the current situation?") and above all by clinical examination, which must be very rigorous:

- Infection

- Anemia

- Urinary Globe

- Faecal impaction

- Dehydration and ionic disorders (dysnatremia, hypercalcemia)

- Hypoglycaemia

- Rhythm disorder

- Myocardial infarction

- Cerebrovascular accident

<u>3- ''Physical trauma:''</u>

''Can be detected by questioning but also by their consequences on clinical examination''.

- Falls

- Fractures

- Heatwave

- PAIN

<u>4-Psychological trauma</u>

To be considered as elimination diagnostics.

- Conflict

- Bereavement

- Moving house, changing rooms or care staff in an institution

For each of these precipitating factors, the chronological sequence must be specified and must be coherent in order to establish responsibility and diagnosis.
