The number of pathologies increases with age, and the definition of polypathology varies from one source to another. Some define it as the presence of more than one co-morbidity, while others arbitrarily define it as the concomitant presence of 5 chronic pathologies, which corresponds to the average number of pathologies in geriatric patients.

'''Polypathology is associated with polymedication and an increased risk of iatrogenesis'''.
