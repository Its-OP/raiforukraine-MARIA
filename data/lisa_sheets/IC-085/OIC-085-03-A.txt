Presbyopia is the loss of the amplitude of accommodation that is inevitable with age (after 40-45 years). It is caused by the enlargement of the lens, the relative weakness of the ciliary muscle and the loss of elasticity of the capsule or lens envelope. It is responsible for a drop in near visual acuity. Normal reading at 30 cm becomes difficult, and patients often say that they have to "stretch out their arms" to read. This discomfort generates signs of "fatigue": headache, red eyes, tingling or watering eyes.

Presbyopia must be compensated for by the addition of a correction consisting of spherical convex lenses. If the patient already has correction for distance vision, the presbyopia correction is added to this. These may be corrective lenses used only for near vision (monofocal lenses), or bifocal lenses (bifocal: clear separation between distance and near vision) or, better still, progressive lenses (the power of the lens varies progressively from its upper part, which corresponds to distance vision, to its lower part, which allows near vision by addition). This correction can also be achieved using multifocal contact lenses, corneal refractive surgery (not yet validated) or by fitting a multifocal lens implant during cataract surgery.

This necessary addition increases with the degree of presbyopia, which worsens with age:

- at the age of 45: addition of 1 diopter

- age 60 and over: addition of 3 dioptres.
