== Surgery: triple objective ==

* Neurological decompression: the technique depends on the aetiology, e.g. removal of a herniated disc/discectomy, evacuation/drainage of a haematoma or epidural abscess.
* Stabilisation of an unstable vertebral fracture (osteosynthesis)
* Samples taken for diagnostic confirmation (pathological anatomy, bacteriology)

== General measures

* Avoid aggravating factors: bed rest if fracture is unstable, +/- immobilisation with a neck brace/corset.
* Prevention of decubitus complications: antithrombotic prophylaxis, mobilisation and massage of pressure points.
* Screen for bladder and bowel problems: urinary catheterisation

== Complementary / etiological treatments: ==

* e.g. Radiotherapy for vertebroepidural metastases
* e.g. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for infectious epiduritis

== Rehabilitation of neurological deficits and disabilities ==
