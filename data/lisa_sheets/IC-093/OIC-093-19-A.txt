== Understanding deficits and disabilities: ==

* They are secondary to mechanical compression +++, possibly supplemented by ischaemic aggression in the acute phase, or even hydraulic aggression (syringomyelia) in the chronic phase.

== Sequelae and disabilities depend on

* the duration and extent of compression
* the speed with which symptoms develop
* The speed with which treatment is initiated
* Aetiology (e.g. better prognosis if neuroma versus malignant tumour)
