*'''[[Discovery of a spinal cord or vertebral abnormality on medical imaging examination SD-227|abnormal spinal cord MRI]]:''''
**Inflammatory myelitis ([[multiple sclerosis]], MS)
**Infectious myelitis (neurosyphilis)
**Medullary ischaemia/infarction
**Biermer's disease with combined spinal cord sclerosis

*''Normal spinal cord MRI:''''
**Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Charcot's disease)
**Bilateral brain scythe meningioma, with compression of the two para-central lobules (somatotopic representation of the lower limbs on Penfield's homonculus) and revealed by paraparesis (rare) <br /> *Other causes of intermittent limb claudication of a spinal cord
*Other causes of [[Intermittent claudication of a limb SD-069|intermittent claudication of the lower limbs]]: [[Arteriopathy of the aorta, visceral arteries and lower limbs; aneurysms|obliterative arteriopathy of the lower limbs]], [[Radiculalgia and canal syndrome|narrow lumbar canal]]. In both cases, the claudication is ''painful'', unlike the purely motor claudication of spinal cord compression.
