* Positive diagnosis: confirm spinal cord compression, locate it and specify its severity (deformation of the spinal cord, disappearance of the peri-medullary CSF border).
* Aetiological diagnosis: determine whether the compression is of vertebroepidural, intradural extramedullary or intramedullary origin.
* '''Biomechanical assessment:''' search for instability criteria (posterior wall damage, pedicle, fracture) before deciding on possible osteosynthesis
* Lesion extension assessment: status of the vertebrae above and below in the case of diffuse spinal metastases, search for other threatening lesions.
