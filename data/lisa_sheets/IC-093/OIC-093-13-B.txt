'''Positive diagnosis''': confirm compression of the spinal roots of the horsetail, locate it and specify its extent and severity (deformation of the dural sac, disappearance of the peri-medullary CSF border, T2 intramedullary hypersignal testifying to its suffering)

Aetiological diagnosis: this is based on the topographical origin of the compression, i.e. vertebral, disc, epidural or intradural.

Biomechanical assessment: search for instability criteria (damage to the posterior wall, pedicle, fracture) before deciding on possible osteosynthesis.

Assessment of lesion extension: status of the vertebrae above and below in the case of diffuse spinal metastases, search for other threatening lesions, etc.
