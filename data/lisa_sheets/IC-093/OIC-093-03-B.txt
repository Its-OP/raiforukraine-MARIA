*T1, T2, T1 + Gadolinium injection sequences. Very good resolution and sensitivity for exploring bone, discs, ligaments and intra-canal contents. Examination of ''1<sup>er</sup> intension'' to be carried out '''urgently''' in the event of any suspicion of non-traumatic spinal cord compression.
*Myeloscanner'': this is a CT scan of the spine after intra-thecal injection (i.e. into the sub-arachnoid spaces) of contrast medium. In practice, performed in cases where MRI is contraindicated.
*Scanner/Computed tomography (CT): very effective for bone, but not very sensitive for exploring the intracanal contents/soft tissues of the epidural or intradural space.
*Angiography'': exceptional indications, e.g. search for a vascular malformation, localisation of the Adamkievicz radiculo-medullary artery before an invasive procedure, pre-operative embolisation to limit haemorrhage losses.
*Electrophysiological examinations: record the central conduction of the long tracts (latencies and amplitudes). Are ''NOT'' systematic; '''must not delay'' management
*Standard X-rays: marginal; poor sensitivity and resolution; should not delay MRI.
*''Preoperative assessment'''
