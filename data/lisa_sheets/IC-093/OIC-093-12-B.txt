==MRI +++==
reference'' examination. T1, T2, T1 sequences + injection of Gadolinium. Very good resolution and sensitivity for exploring bone, discs, ligaments and intra-canal contents. A ''1st line'' examination to be carried out as an ''emergency'' for any suspected cauda equina syndrome.

==Radiculo-scanner==
This is a CT scan of the spine after intra-thecal injection (i.e. into the sub-arachnoid spaces) of contrast medium. In practice, it is performed when MRI is contraindicated. 

==Computed tomography (CT)==
Very effective for bone, but not very sensitive for exploring the intra-canal contents / soft tissues of the epidural or intradural space. 

==Angiography==
exceptional indications, e.g. preoperative embolisation to limit haemorrhagic losses.

==Electro-neuro-myogram (ENMG)==
not of interest if the clinical examination is typical of cauda equina syndrome; only if there is diagnostic doubt, e.g. with polyradiculoneuritis/Gillain-Barré syndrome or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Charcot's disease).

==Lumbar puncture (LP)
only if MRI excludes compression, otherwise risk of worsening +++; e.g. to look for polyradiculoneuritis/Gillain-Barré syndrome.

==Standard radiographs==
marginal role; poor sensitivity and resolution; should not delay MRI scan

==Preoperative assessment
