==Surgery: triple objective==

*Spinal cord decompression: techniques and approaches (posterior, anterior) depend on the aetiology and location.
*Stabilisation if vertebral fracture is unstable (osteosynthesis)
*Samples for diagnostic confirmation ([[Interpretation of a pathological anatomy report SD-180|pathological anatomy]], bacteriology)

==General measures==

*Avoid aggravating factors: bed rest if the fracture is unstable, +/- immobilisation with a neck brace/corset.
*Management of a patient in prolonged decubitus SD-276|Prevention of decubitus complications]]: Prescription and monitoring of anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant treatment SD-248|Antithrombotic prophylaxis]], mobilisation and massage of pressure points.
*Detect vesico-sphincter disorders: [[Acute retention of urine|urinary catheter]] ([[Acute retention of urine SD-097|acute retention of urine]])

==Additional / etiological treatments=

*e.g. Radiotherapy for vertebroepidural metastases
*e.g. Appropriate antibiotic therapy for infectious epiduritis
