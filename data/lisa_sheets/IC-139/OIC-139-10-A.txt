=='''Terminal phase'''==

* The term ''terminal phase'' (''end of life'') is used in the natural course of a disease when death is imminent and inevitable.'''
* There is a '''vital threat with progressive failure of one or more vital functions''.
* Duration: from a few days (sometimes a few hours) to a few weeks.
* Schematically divided into '''2 phases''': the '''pre-agonic''' phase and the '''agonic''' phase.

==='''The pre-agonic phase'''===

* First part of the terminal phase.
* May progress to the agonal phase or be reversible.
* Numerous clinical signs may be present depending on the initial pathology, but ''are not specific''.

===''The agonic phase'''===

* Final stage before death, lasting from a few hours to a few days (48-72 hours).
* Considered irreversible.
* '''Numerous clinical signs, non-pathognomonic, very great individual variability''' :
** <u>Neurological</u> (first signs of decerebration): areactive coma, disappearance of reflexes (including corneal reflex), hypotonia, myoclonus....
** <u>Respiratory</u>: fluctuating respiratory rate, neurological respiration (Cheyne-Stockes), respiratory pauses, cyanosis of extremities and perioral area, congestion (agonic rales or "gasps"), respiration with mandibular movements...
** <u>Cardiocirculatory functions</u> (hypoperfusion phenomenon): tachycardia, thready pulse, abolition of peripheral pulses (radial in particular), mottling, profuse diarrhoea, anuria, cold extremities...
<u>General</u>: increased body temperature (more rarely hypothermia), waxy complexion, reflex lacrimal secretions...

==Adapting care in the terminal phase ==

* The aim of care is exclusively focused on the comfort of the patient, his or her support and the support of those around them.
* Each symptom must be managed to ensure patient relief. A ''combination of medicinal and non-medicinal therapies'' is often necessary. Drug therapies must be delivered in the most appropriate galenic form.
* ''''anticipation'' of the various symptoms is necessary, with the drafting of '''anticipated prescriptions'''.
* Certain supportive therapies are no longer useful in the terminal phase, and may even be harmful. Artificial nutrition and hydration may therefore be discontinued''. It is important to keep patients and their families informed.

==Place of care ==
Care can be provided in medical-social establishments or at home (or a home-like setting), depending on the wishes of the patient and his or her family. [2C-139-PC-B03
