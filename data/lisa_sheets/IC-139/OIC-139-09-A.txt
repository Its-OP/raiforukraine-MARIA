|'''Identified etiology (frequent examples in palliative situations)'''
|'''Etiological treatment'''
|-
|'''Bronchial obstructive syndrome'''
|Bronchodilators (beta-mimetics, anticholinergics).

Rational discussion of Non-Invasive Ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy.
|-
|Left heart failure
|loop diuretics.

Cardiological treatment: beta-blockers, amiodarone, etc.

Reduction in water intake linked to treatments to avoid water restriction (palliative specificity).

|Carcinomatous lymphangitis.
|Corticosteroid therapy.

Discuss palliative chemotherapy.

|Pleurisy
|Evacuation puncture or drainage.
|-
|Infection
|Antibiotics.
|-
|Anemia
|Transfusion.

Discuss erythropoietin.
|-
| colspan="2" |'''Symptomatic treatment''''
|-
| Morphine (bradypneic effect and lowering of the response threshold to hypercapnia).

Non-medicinal means: installation, adapted breathing techniques, ventilation of the room, etc.

Discuss oxygen therapy (patient's subjective opinion of benefit, no saturation target, risk of mucous membranes drying out).

Anxiolytic treatment if anxiety (short half-life benzodiazepine).

Anticholinergic treatment if associated congestion (scopolamine).
|}

===<small>'''b) Agonic rales''</small>===

*Anti-secretory anticholinergics (scopolamine) and reduced water intake.
*Appropriate positioning (patient comfort position, half-seated or lateral decubitus) and mouth care.
*Tracheobronchial aspirations inappropriate for palliative situations.

==<small>'''2. Digestive symptoms''</small><big></big>==

===<small>'''a) [[Nausea SD-012|Nausea and vomiting]]'''</small>===

*<u>Non-medicinal treatments</u>: mouth care, fractionated, cold and light diet, transcutaneous electrostimulation of the vagus nerve, acupuncture.

|-
|'''Stimulation of the Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (CTZ)''''
|Neuroleptic antidopaminergic (e.g. chlorpromazine, metoclopramide, metopimazine).

Setrons.

Substance P inhibitors (aprepitant).
|-
|Stimulation of the vestibular system
|Anticholinergics: scopolamine, diphenhydramine.

Antihistamines (e.g. hydroxyzine).
|-
|''Stimulation of peripheral pathways'''
|Gastric prokinetic neuroleptics (e.g. metoclopramide, metopimazine, domperidone).

Gastric emptying stimulator: erythromicin IV.
|-
|'''<u>Central stimulation</u>''''
|Depending on aetiology:

- Anti-odematous: corticosteroids, mannitol, diuretic (e.g. acetazolamide), SSH

- Tumour mass: discuss radiotherapy

- Anticipatory chemotherapy vomiting: benzodiazepines.

===<small>'''b) Constipation''</small>===
(See: [[Knowing the principles of managing chronic constipation 2C-283-PC-B01]])

'''Constipation on opioids:'''

*<Systematic prophylaxis with an osmotic or stimulant laxative (not a ballast laxative) and hygiene and dietetic instructions.

*<In the event of failure</u> of a well-administered preventive treatment (or poor tolerance):

~ Peripheral morphine antagonists (e.g. methylnaltrexone, naloxegol): second-line, contraindicated in cases of known or suspected intestinal obstruction or patients at risk of obstruction (e.g. peritoneal carcinosis).

~ Absence of stool for 4 days: dual laxative therapy, discussion of a rectal laxative (if stool on rectal examination) and discussion of a peripheral antagonist.

~ If unsuccessful after 48 hours: treatment with colonic preparation or large enema.

==<small>'''4. Neuropsychological symptoms '''</small>==
<small>(see: [[Confusion, dementia (see item 132)]]; [[Prescription and monitoring of psychotropic drugs (see item 330)]])</small>

===<small>'''a) Palliative confusion''</small>===

*Aetiological treatment as early as possible (prognosis).
*Regular clinical monitoring.
*Non-drug measures: adapting the environment, providing security, reassuring the patient and carers, avoiding physical restraints.
*Symptomatic treatment: neuroleptics (unless delirium tremens: benzodiazepines).

===<small>'''b) Anxiety''</small>===

*<u>Non-medicinal measures</u>: psychotherapy, support, complementary approaches.
*<u>Medicinal treatments</u> possible if disabling anxiety:

~ Benzodiazepines: start at a low dose, increase gradually, give preference to molecules with a short half-life.

<u>NB</u>: in palliative care, the risk of addiction should not be a brake on their use.

~ Hydroxyzine: primarily sedative action, to be avoided in the elderly (anticholinergic effect).

~ Neuroleptics: if benzodiazepines fail or associated delusions (hallucinations, nightmares, etc.).

~ Imipraminic antidepressants and SSRIs: especially if pathological anxiety.
