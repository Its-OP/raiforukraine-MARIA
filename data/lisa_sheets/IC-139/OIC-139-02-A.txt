The organisation of palliative care (PC) aims to :

*To enable all people who are ill to receive PS appropriate to their condition,
*whatever their condition, age, place of residence or hospitalization.

==<small>'''1. Graduated PS organisation tailored to the needs of patients and their relatives'''</small>==
The organisation of care must '''take into account several parameters'':

*The patient's place of care: home, medico-social establishments and structures, health establishments, etc.
*the patient's age
*'''The wishes of the patient and their family and friends'''
*'''Existing resources in the patient's environment'''

==<2. A gradation of care''</small>==

===→ <small>'''<u>In hospital:</u> (Figure 1)'''</small>===
Care provision is graded '''according to:'''

*gravity,
*complexity,
*the evolution and stability of the patient's situation.

'''Three levels exist:''''

*First level: support in a hospital department WITHOUT identified palliative care beds (LISP) when the situation does not present any particular clinical, social or ethical difficulties;

*Second level: hospital service WITH LISP when the service is faced with frequent end-of-life or deaths (with appropriate organisation and team training);

*Third level:
**'''Unités de Soins Palliatifs (USP)''' which take charge of the most complex and/or unstable situations ;
**'''Équipes Mobiles de Soins Palliatifs''' '''(EMSP)''': they can also intervene at the request of professionals; more particularly in support of the first and second levels.

===→ <small>''<u>At home and in medico-social establishments and services, particularly in establishments for dependent elderly people (EHPAD):</u> (Figure 2)'''</small>===

*The attending physician and the nurse are the first to be involved.

*Hospitalisation A Domicile (HAH) can be used at home or in medical and social establishments and services, particularly in EHPAD, if the complexity of the care (medical and paramedical) requires it; it can be used 24 hours a day. The attending physician remains the linchpin of care.

*The out-of-hospital EMSP or PS network may also be called upon for its PS expertise, regardless of the professionals treating the patient.
