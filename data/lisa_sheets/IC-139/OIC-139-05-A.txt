It is important to know how palliative care (PC) is organised ([[Learn about the organisation of palliative care in France 2C-139-DE-A02|2C-139-DE-A02]]), which varies depending on the patient's place of care.

==<small>'''1. When to call on an in-hospital mobile palliative care team (EMSP) or an out-of-hospital mobile palliative care team (EMSP)/SP networks?''</small>==
The EMSP is a '''multidisciplinary and multi-professional team'''

The EMSP goes to the patient's bedside and to the carers (in health establishments = in hospital / outside health establishments = out of hospital) ...'''

"EMSP extra hospital'''='''''SP network''.

The request => '''emanates''' '''from a health professional''' and may be initiated by the '''patient or his relatives''.

'''Missions:'''

'''- No direct acts of care,'''

'''-A wide variety of actions is possible''' ranging from telephone advice to a consultation or summary meeting, team support or training.

==<small>'''2. When to use palliative care beds (LISP) </small>==
LISPs enable '''patients to be cared for in a hospital department as close to home as possible''' => allowing '''continuity between these different forms of care.'''

'''The decision to admit a patient to a LISP is made with'''

- the joint opinion of the patient or their relatives,

- the patient's usual doctor,

- and the department's "referral" doctor.


LISPs are made up of medical and paramedical teams "trained in the management of non-complex palliative situations".

LISPs must be able to benefit from the intervention of an EMSP.

==<small>'''3. When to use a Palliative Care Unit (PCU)'''</small>==
USP = specialised units with '''specific and exclusive SP activity'''

Transfers/admission to the PACU => for ''complex situations'' (with the patient's agreement)

For example:

o ''the patient has a major deterioration in quality of life'' ''linked to the intensity or instability of symptoms and/or to intense and intractable mental suffering'' and/or to a complex social and family situation;

o '''a difficult question in the field of ethics'''.

o ''a respite stay'' to support the main carer (to ensure that they can remain at home in the long term), ...

''It is the multiplicity of criteria that defines complexity'' and justifies the indication for admission to an SPU.

See: [[Knowing the organisation of palliative care in France 2C-139-DE-A02|<big>Knowing the organisation of palliative care in France 2C-139-DE-A02</big>]]


These recourse teams, and ''in particular the EMSP and USP'', may be called upon ''as third parties'' to take part in deliberations, collegial decisions and ethical discussions.
