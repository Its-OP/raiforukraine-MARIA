==<small>'''1. Symptoms''</small><big> </big>==

*Subjective experiences that often have a negative impact on quality of life.
*Frequency increasing with advancing disease and deteriorating functional abilities.
*Systematically assessed, as a priority by dedicated <u>self-assessment scales</u>.
*Always assess other associated symptoms (particularly anxiety, anorexia, asthenia and depression) if necessary using multidimensional scales.
*<A reasoned and proportionate aetiological approach</u> depending on the patient's clinical situation.

==<small>'''2. Respiratory symptoms''</small>==

===<small>'''a) Dyspnoea''</small>===
(see: [[Definition of dyspnoea in general and more specifically inspiratory / expiratory dyspnoea 2C-203-DE-A01|Definition]])

*Feeling of shortness of breath, whether or not associated with polypnoea.
*Not correlated with hypoxaemia.
*Clinical examination (physical and functional signs) and reasonable paraclinical investigations should lead to a search for a specific cause in order to propose appropriate treatment.

===<small>'''b) Agonal rales''</small>===
(see: [[Knowing how to identify the clinical features of the agonic phase of serious, chronic, progressive or lethal illnesses 2C-139-DP-A03|Definition]])

*Very common in the last days of life.
*Psychological and emotional impact on family and carers.

==<small>'''3. Digestive symptoms''</small>==

===<small>'''a) Nausea and vomiting''</small>===

*Nausea is a subjective sensation corresponding to the desire to vomit; vomiting corresponds to the expulsion of undigested gastric contents through the mouth.
*Assessment of nausea: nausea VAS
*Evaluation of vomiting: frequency, type and quantity.

===<small>'''b) Constipation''</small>===
(see: [[Definition of chronic constipation 2C-283-DE-A01|Definition]])

- In palliative care, ''often multiple etiologies'', to be investigated:

*Compliance with dietary hygiene rules (sedentary lifestyle, insufficient water intake, low-fibre diet, swallowing problems, impaired functional capacity, etc.);
*Tumour: obstruction of the digestive lumen;
*Metabolic (hypercalcaemia, chronic renal failure, hypothyroidism, diabetes, etc.);
*Neurological (spinal cord injury, neurovascular, inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the central nervous system, peripheral neuropathy);
*Iatrogenic (opioids, antidepressants, anticholinergics, antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, certain chemotherapies, setrons, etc.).

- '''Constipation on opioids:''' expected side effect; must be systematically prevented.

<u>See</u>: [[Analgesic, medicinal and non-medicinal therapies]][[Constipation SD-001|; Constipation SD-001]]

===<small>'''c) Intestinal occlusion''</small>===
(see: [[Know the definition of occlusive syndrome, differentiate between high and low occlusion 2C-354-DE-A01|Definition]] and [[Know the cardinal signs of occlusion 2C-354-DP-A02|Diagnosis]])

*A frequent complication of intra-abdominal tumours.
*Knowledge of the CT signs of an occlusion and their presence according to the site of the occlusion 2C-354-CM-B01|Abdomino-pelvic CT scan]] systematic at the first episode, to be discussed at the time of iterative episodes in a palliative situation.
*The aetiological diagnosis will lead to discussion of the type of treatment to be offered.

*[[Knowledge of the major occlusion mechanisms and their complications 2C-354-EP-B01|Two major mechanisms]] :

~ Mechanical: extrinsic compression (peritoneal carcinosis, flanges, etc.) and intrinsic compression.

~ Functional: tumour infiltration, neurological damage, iatrogenia, ileus, ionic disorders, etc.

<u>See</u>: [[Abdominal distension SD-003]]; [[Abdominal pain SD-004]]

==<small>'''4. Symptoms of the oral sphere''</small><big> </big>==

*Thirst, fungal infections, mouth pain, erosions, bleeding, etc.
*Encourage the onset of other symptoms (nausea, anorexia, anxiety, etc.).
*Always justify basic oral hygiene measures and, if necessary, appropriate mouth care.

==<small>'''5. Anorexia-cachexia syndrome''</small>==

*Common in all advanced palliative situations.
*Weight loss often associated with asthenia, sarcopenia, anorexia and an inflammatory state leading to impaired functional capacity.
*Cannot be corrected by nutritional support.

==<small>'''6. Neuropsychological symptoms''</small>==

===<small>'''a) Palliative confusion''</small>===
(see: [[Knowing how to look for the causes of mental confusion 2C-108-DP-A01|Elements of diagnosis]])

*Very common in palliative care, especially in the last hours of life (terminal delirium).
*Two forms (may coexist): agitated and slowed down.
*Sudden onset, with disturbance of the nycthemeral cycle and fluctuating signs.
*Generally multifactorial and organic.
*A reversible cause should be sought and treated ([[Acute retention of urine SD-097|acute retention of urine]], faecal impaction, iatrogenia, etc.).

===<small>'''b) Anxiety''</small>===

*Corresponds to an imprecise fear.
*Often adaptive and transient in palliative or bereavement situations, it can nevertheless become pathological depending on its intensity, duration and repercussions.
*May result from an organic disorder (pain, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, metabolic disorder), in which case etiological treatment is required.
