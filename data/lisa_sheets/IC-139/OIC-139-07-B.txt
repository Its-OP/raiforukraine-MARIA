==<small>''Treatments ("drug therapies")''</small>==
They can be:

*Specific ("aetiological")": aimed at slowing down or containing the progression of the causal disease (e.g. chemotherapy, etc.) and/or treating complications arising during the course of this disease (e.g. antibiotic therapy, etc.), in order to improve the patient's overall survival and/or ensure the best possible comfort.
*Partial or total replacement of vital functions, directly or indirectly linked to the causal disease: aimed at prolonging survival and/or ensuring the patient's comfort by limiting the occurrence of certain symptoms (e.g. dialysis, transfusion, etc.).
*Symptomatic'': aimed at containing the symptoms of the disease without acting on the causal disease itself (e.g. analgesics, transfusions, etc.).

Depending on the patient's situation, the same treatment may be used for one or more of the above objectives (e.g. transfusion).

==<small>''Therapeutic approach''</small>==

*In a palliative situation, a ''deliberation must be carried out to define the objective(s) of care'': increasing the quantity of life, supporting vital functions, improving quality of life, etc. Choices have to be made.
*Permanent questioning of the relevance and proportionality of care and treatment is necessary.

==<small>'''Discontinuation of specific or life-sustaining treatments?''</small>==

*The question arises in various circumstances: ineffectiveness of treatments, unfavourable benefit-risk balance, patient wishes, etc.
*Sometimes specific and suppletive treatments are continued because they could improve the patient's comfort; these indications must be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
*Stopping treatment does not mean stopping care: more support is needed.
