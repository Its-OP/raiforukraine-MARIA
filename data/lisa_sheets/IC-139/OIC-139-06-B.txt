==<small>'''Life trajectories''</small>==
Depending on the disease, '''3 different life trajectories'' have been defined to illustrate patients' care pathways:

*'''Trajectory 1''''Rapid decline'': progressive evolution and relatively well-defined terminal phase (e.g. cancers).

*''Trajectory 2'' "gradual decline": acute episodes of aggravation and recovery time. Death may be sudden and unexpected (e.g. organ failure).

*'''Trajectory 3''''Slow decline'': very gradual loss of functional and/or cognitive abilities (e.g. neurodegenerative diseases).

See: [[Knowing the specific features of palliative care for patients with oncological and haematological malignancies, degenerative neurological diseases and end-stage organ failure 2C-139-PC-B04|Knowing the specific features of palliative care for patients with oncological and haematological malignancies, degenerative neurological diseases and end-stage organ failure]]

==<small>''Palliative approach''</small>==

*Palliative care promotes comprehensive, interdisciplinary and personalised care for patients with serious and progressive illnesses, whatever their pathology.

*Depending on the patient's life trajectory, the palliative approach may be implemented at different times, in response to very different identified needs. Depending on the complexity of their situation, patients will require different treatments, care and support.

==<small>''Approach to care: When to seek out a specialist palliative care team''</small>==

*Various specialised palliative care structures exist: ([[Knowing how to call on resource teams or referral services 2C-139-PC-A01|Knowing how to call on resource teams or referral services 2C-139-PC-A01)]]

*Pallia 10 tool: http://www.sfap.org/system/files/pallia10.pdf

~ '''Objective''': to help determine whether recourse to an EMSP is appropriate

~ List of 10 items with a positive response to the first item required to use the Pallia10 and move on to the next questions

~ '''Beyond 3 positive responses''', consider using a specialist MS team

A version adapted for the elderly exists ("Pallia10 Géronto").
