'''<u>Definition and concept of nociceptive pain</u>''''

- A useful alarm signal in the acute phase, nociceptive pain or pain caused by an excess of nociception provides information about a stimulus - injury or aggression - which threatens tissue integrity (see physiology section).

- These pains are generally acute and sometimes associated with neuropathic phenomena: we then talk about mixed pain (i.e. cancer pain).

- They are frequent and still too often outsourced.

- Treatment focuses not only on the intensity but also on the aetiology



'''<u>Main etiologies of nociceptive pain</u>''''


- Traumatic and/or intra- and post-operative pain: this is not directly correlated with the extent of tissue damage and varies from one individual to another. Intra-operative pain is prevented by anaesthesia (general or loco-regional), while post-operative pain requires an analgesic strategy.

- Inflammatory pain" is often acute, as in renal colic (due to distension and inflammatory reaction of the urinary tract upstream of an obstacle) or tissue infection, or more prolonged, as in arthritis flare-ups in the context of chronic joint damage (rheumatoid arthritis, chondrocalcinosis, gout).

- Mechanical pain, linked to movement, either when walking in a context of ''osteoarthritis, or spinal joint overload'' (cervicalgia, dorsalgia, lumbago) or during ''prolonged joint stress'', or during ''certain treatments, particularly physiotherapy''.

- The "pain of cancer" (see below).

- Pain induced by treatment (see above).


'''<u>Diagnosis and main features</u>''''

- Unlike neuropathic pain, nociceptive pain does not necessarily have a specific symptomatology.

- They are generally located opposite the lesion and may be associated with inflammatory signs, particularly in the event of acute pain or acute painful flare-ups of a chronic pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis flare-ups).
