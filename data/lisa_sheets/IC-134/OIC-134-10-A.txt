- The elderly population is heterogeneous in terms of biological ageing and cognitive decline (linked to age or neurodegenerative pathology). Ageing alters the perception and expression of pain, especially if there is cognitive impairment. Pain remains ''under-estimated and under-treated'' and treatment must be ''individualised and adapted'' according to the patient's state of health (''co-morbidities and chronic treatments, state of emunctory functions).

- Acute pain: certain acute pathologies that are usually painful in adults (myocardial infarction, visceral pain, ulcers, fractures) can be "silent" in the elderly, who often present late at the emergency department, consult and report their pain later than younger adults, with more complications that can be serious or even fatal.

- Chronic pain: the prevalence is "high", affecting between 40% and 80% of people living at home or in institutions, with a variety of aetiologies (osteoarticular, muscular, neuropathic, iatrogenic, etc.).

- Pain management is based on '''4 pillars:''' '''R'''epérage,''''E'''appraisal,''''T'''raitement and always Re-'''E'''appraisal of pain in order to judge the effectiveness of the approach adopted. It includes the care teams and/or the family.


'''<u>Know the particularities of pain management in the elderly</u>''''


'''Spotting'''

- Some types of pain are predictable (pain during care, pressure sores, etc.), even if this is not specific to the elderly (see "Prevalence and epidemiology" section), while others are more difficult to anticipate (paroxysmal attacks of pain) or to identify.

- You need to look for "warning signs" and have a pain reflex, especially if the behaviour is abnormal, such as agitation or screaming.

- Any elderly person who expresses pain or behaviour suggestive of pain is indeed in pain. We need to apply the "precautionary principle" and fight against preconceived ideas, beliefs, fears and representations held by patients and those around them, such as "It's normal to be in pain when you're old".


'''Evaluation'''

- The patient will be correctly seated (environment, wearing of glasses, hearing aids and dental prostheses), with an empathetic and patient approach, a climate of trust and taking into account any cognitive or expressive difficulties.

- A "geriatric assessment" (including depression and behaviour) is carried out in addition to identifying the components of the pain.

- Self-assessment is carried out using a simple numerical or verbal scale rather than the VAS. In the event of failure, an observation of behaviours using a ''hetero-evaluation'' scale (Algoplus®, Doloplus®, ECPA®) is used, preferably in a team, and this evaluation is repeated regularly.


'''Treatment'''

- Ageing ''modifies the pharmacology'' (pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, efficacy) of drugs, including analgesics. The analgesics and coantalgesics used are the same as those used by younger adults, but the adverse effects and contraindications are more numerous because of "co-morbidities and polymedication". The contribution of clinical pharmacists can be useful in screening for drug-related iatrogenia and in drug conciliation.

- Mixed nociceptive and neuropathic pain often coexists in the elderly.

- Before any analgesic is prescribed, the patient's state of health, drug treatment, renal function, weight, nutritional status, cognitive and emotional state, social situation and compliance must be ascertained. Dosage adjustments are recommended, dosages increased slowly ("start low and go slow"), and renal function monitored.

- Potential '''adverse effects and interactions''' of the added analgesic drug are '''anticipated''' and avoided, but pain should not be under-treated for fear of adverse effects. Topical oral and local administration routes are preferred.

- It is recommended that analgesics be combined with non-pharmacological techniques, which are perfectly feasible with a few adaptations to the sensory deficits caused by ageing (sight, hearing, mobility).


'''Revaluation'''

- Always reassess to ''adapt and prioritise'' treatments in order to reduce multi-medication and optimise the benefit-risk balance.

- An elderly patient who does not complain can be painful.
