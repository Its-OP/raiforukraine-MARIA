'''<u>Epidemiology</u>'''


- '''A third of French people (31%) over the age of 18 say they have suffered from daily pain for more than 3 months and 20% have chronic pain of moderate to severe intensity'''.

- One in 2 chronic pain patients has a reduced quality of life.

- Two out of 3 patients are not relieved by their treatment.

- More than 60% of patients admitted to emergency departments have moderate to severe pain, and less than 1 in 2 receive analgesic treatment on admission.

- Almost 20% of patients who undergo surgery are left with painful after-effects.

- 45% of chronic pain patients take time off work for an average of more than 4 months a year.

- '''Five times more time off work in chronic pain patients/general population.'''

- More than 2/3 of patients (70%) suffering from chronic pain have psychosocial repercussions (sleep disorders, anxiety, depression, cognitive problems).


'''<u>Pain in the city</u>''''

- '''Pain is the number one reason for consultations, both in emergency departments and with GPs.'''

- Less than 3% of chronic pain patients are treated in a specialised pain centre or facility, which acts as a multi-professional referral centre for the most complex patients in conjunction with outpatient care.    

'''<u>Pain in hospital</u>''''

- Induced pain: induced by the carer during the clinical examination in search of arguments to identify the mechanisms involved and therefore provide useful information for management (clinical examination, testing of different sensitivity modes).

- Iatrogenic pain: unintentionally caused by the carer or by a treatment, in foreseeable circumstances. It is generally pain induced by care (such as the re-dressing of dressings, sutures, vascular punctures, mobilisation in intensive care, etc.) or by a diagnostic examination (such as a biopsy), sometimes referred to as procedural pain. Procedural pain must be anticipated and prevented by appropriate means, which often requires a multimodal approach (systemic medication, local or loco-regional anaesthesia, anxiety management, complementary techniques such as hypnosis, neurostimulation, etc.).
