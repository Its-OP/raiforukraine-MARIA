'''<u>Definition and concept of neuropathic pain</u>'''

- '''Pain caused by injury or disease of the somatosensory system'''

- '''Opposed to "nociceptive" pain''' or "pain caused by excess nociception" linked to abnormal activation of the nociceptors (osteoarthritis, arthritis, common lumbago, etc.).

- A distinction is made between peripheral neuropathic pain (nerve trunk, sensory ganglion, plexus, nerve root) and central pain (spinal cord, brain).

- The symptoms and mechanisms of neuropathic pain (see "Physiopathology" section) are only loosely linked to the aetiology. As a result, treatment depends little or not at all on the aetiology, and if possible is based on an analysis of the pain mechanisms.


'''<u>Main etiologies of neuropathic pain</u>''''


- The most common cause of neuropathic pain in the general population is radiculopathy, particularly sciatica (herniated disc, post-spinal surgery, disc disease, etc.).

- Other peripheral causes are :  

- Surgery or trauma leading to nerve damage (e.g. post-thoracotomy pain, post-mastectomy pain, total prosthesis, inguinal hernia surgery, dental avulsion, etc.).

- Root canal syndrome (e.g. carpal tunnel).

- Diabetic and non-diabetic neuropathy (alcohol, vasculitis, HIV, Guillain-Barré, chemotherapy, toxic, genetic, deficiency, so-called "idiopathic small fibre neuropathy", etc.)

- Shingles (post-herpes zoster pain)

- Cancer (truncal or plexus invasion, radiation plexopathy or neuropathy, post-chemotherapy neuropathy, post-mastectomy pain syndrome caused by damage to the intercostobrachial nerve during axillary lymph node dissection)

- Trigeminal neuropathy (V) (see also facial neuralgia), glosso-pharyngeal neuropathy (IX)

- The main causes are :

- Spinal cord injury (e.g. traumatic, myelitis, syringomyelia)

- Stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic)

- Severe head injury (with brain damage); spinal cord injury,

- Multiple sclerosis


'''<u>Diagnosis and main features</u>''''

- Specific context of onset (e.g. diabetes, shingles, surgery, herniated disc, cerebrovascular accident, etc.), sometimes with a delay (several months or years after the initial event), especially in the case of a central lesion.

- '''Particular quality of pain''': continuous spontaneous pain (such as burning/heat, painful cold, cramps), paroxysmal pain (electric shocks, stabbing), provoked pain (pain induced by friction, cold, heat)

- Presence of ''paresthesias/dysesthesias'' in the painful area (paresthesias: abnormal non-painful sensations such as tingling, pins and needles, itching, numbness; dysesthesias: the same, but frankly unpleasant).

- The pain is located in a ''neuro-anatomical territory compatible with peripheral nerve damage'' (symmetrical distal distribution beginning in the feet for length-dependent neuropathy, thoracic or trigeminal dermatomal for shingles, radicular for sciatica, etc.) or central (hemi-body for stroke/SEP, both lower limbs for spinal cord damage, etc.).

- Pain is associated with ''hypoesthesia'' (hot, cold, stinging), ''allodynia'' (pain induced by normally painless stimulation) or ''hyperalgesia'' (increased pain in response to painful stimulation) ± motor deficit, reflex abnormality, spasticity (depending on the aetiological context).

- Additional tests are not necessary to diagnose the neuropathic nature of the pain. They are useful for confirming the nerve lesion and its aetiology, depending on the clinical context.

- The ''DN4'' questionnaire (neuropathic pain in 4 questions) ''differentiates DN from nociceptive pain'' with excellent sensitivity and specificity (> 80%) for a score ≥ 4 out of 10 (Fig 1) and ≥ 3 out of 7 for its ''questioning'' version (without clinical examination) which can be completed by a non-health worker or the patient.
