'''<u>Definition</u>'''

- '''Pain associated with an alteration in nociception despite the absence of evidence of a tissue lesion activating the nociceptors or of a disease or lesion affecting the somato-sensory system.'''

- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome.

- The pathophysiology of this pain is less well known than for other injury mechanisms.

- The most well-documented hypothesis is that they depend mainly on an alteration in "pain control and modulation systems", with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.


'''<u>Nociplastic pain syndromes</u>''''

- Fibromyalgia (see below)

- ''Irritable bowel syndrome'' (chronic abdominal pain - at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months - related to defecation, with changes in stool frequency or appearance; present for at least 6 months)

- Cystalgia with clear urine (urinary urgency)

- Temporomandibular joint syndrome

- Primary headaches

- Complex regional pain syndrome type I (algodystrophy)


'''<u>Knowing how to explain nociplastic pain to the patient</u>''''

- We explain to patients that it is a "pain control defect or dysregulation", a central neurological disorder of the pain pathways, sometimes with an identified contributing factor (physical or psychological trauma), on a pre-existing genetic or psychological background.

- Patients will be told that "treatment should not be limited to medication," but should always combine a physical and psychological approach, whatever the cause or context.

- Once the diagnosis has been made, information should be provided in writing, and "regular, gentle physical exercise" should be recommended as a first-line treatment, particularly in cases of fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome and temporomaxillary joint syndrome.


'''<u>Fibromyalgia</u>''''

- Fibromyalgia (FM) is common (1.6% of the population) and affects women at least twice as often as men.

- It is the ''most frequent chronic diffuse pain pathology'' and one of the most common types of non-disciplinary pain (along with irritable bowel syndrome).

- Many pathologies can mimic and/or be associated with FM (RA, SpA, Lupus, osteoarthritis, small-fibre neuropathy, etc.).

- There are practical questionnaires for screening and diagnosing fibromyalgia, in particular the simple, validated FiRST questionnaire (Table 1).  

- The ACR criteria (revised in 2016) are

- Diffuse pain affecting at least 4 out of 5 areas of the body

- Symptoms for at least 3 months

- Diffuse Pain Index (DPI) (0-19) and Symptom Severity Scale (SS) (0-12): based on the presence and intensity of the following symptoms: fatigue (0-3), waking up without rest (0-3), cognitive impairment (0-3) and, in the last 6 months: headaches (0-1), abdominal pain/cramps (0-1) and depression (0-1).

- The diagnosis is made if the combination of IDD > 7 and SS > 5 or the combination of IDD between 4 and 6 and SS > 9.

- '''Frequent associated somatic symptoms'': asthenia, sleep disorders, tension headaches, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, restless legs syndrome, urinary urgency M

- Frequent associated ''psychological and cognitive symptoms'': anxiety and depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress, hypervigilance (excessive focus on pain), neuroticism (tendency to express negative emotions), feelings of injustice, inflexible coping strategies, catastrophism, concentration/attention and memory problems, etc.

- '''Complementary examinations must be limited''': CBC platelets, CRP, Ionogram TSH, PTH, Vit D, autoantibodies if clinically indicated, no X-rays

- '''Treatment must be multimodal'': provide the diagnosis and integrate multidisciplinary approaches with the patient's involvement, without giving false hope of magical results

- '''Non-medicinal treatments: to be offered as first-line treatment'': adapted physical activity, cognitive and behavioural approaches (in the case of adjustment difficulties), relaxation/hypnosis/mindfulness meditation techniques, etc.

- Recommended drug treatments similar to those for neuropathic pain: antidepressants (tricyclics, SNRIs) and antiepileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin, the latter with caution, see below): 30-40% improvement in 40% of patients.

- Level 1 or 2 analgesics: not very effective

- '''Strong opioids, corticoids, benzodiazepines: strongly inadvisable'''

- '''Risk of abuse and misuse for tramadol and pregabalin'''
