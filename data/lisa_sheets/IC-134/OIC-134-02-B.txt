'''<u>Neurophysiological bases of pain</u>''''

- Pain plays a major physiological role in protecting the body's integrity.

- The general neurophysiological organisation of the ''''' nociceptive system''''' underlying pain perception is similar to that of other sensory systems.


'''Detection'''

- Nociceptive stimuli, i.e. potentially dangerous to the body, are detected by peripheral receptors called "nociceptors".

- Nociceptors are free endings of small-diameter peripheral nerve fibres called ''Adelta and C fibres'', located throughout the body's tissues (skin, muscles, joints, viscera).

- Nociceptive messages are generated by molecules called "transducers", located on the surface of the endings of the Adelta and C fibres.


'''Transmission:'''

- After travelling through the peripheral nerves, the Adelta and C fibres join the central nervous system via the posterior spinal roots and project to the posterior horn of the spinal cord.

- Nociceptive neurons located in the posterior horn of the spinal cord then transmit these messages to the brain (Figure 1) .

- Most of the axons of the nociceptive neurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord cross the median line to join the spinothalamic bundle.

- Part of this bundle, which projects to the ''lateral thalamus'' and then to the ''primary and secondary somaesthetic cortices'', is more involved in the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain.

- A second part, which projects onto the ''medial thalamus'' and then the ''cingulate and insular cortex (limbic cortex)'' is more involved in the emotional aspects of pain (Figure 1).

- Medullary nociceptive neurons also project to bulbar and pontoencephalic r''elays''' involved in the cognitive (fear, anticipation, memory of nociceptive damage), behavioural (escape, immobilisation, defence, attack) or neuroendocrine (release of stress hormones) reactions associated with pain (Figure 1).

Segmental and supra-segmental modulation

- Powerful ''control mechanisms'' enable nociceptive information generated in the periphery to be extracted, integrated and modulated.

- Segmental modulation" mechanisms acting in the spinal cord are based on the inhibition of small diameter fibres (nociceptors) by the simultaneous activation of large diameter fibres. The discovery of these mechanisms led to the use of transcutaneous electrical stimulation and spinal cord electrical stimulation to treat certain types of pain.

- Supra-segmental modulation mechanisms (''Figure 2) originate in brain structures, particularly in the brainstem (periaqueductal grey matter, raphe nuclei, etc.) and involve different neurotransmitter systems such as the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.

- They are also called ''descending controls'' because they are able to modulate, either by inhibiting or facilitating it, the activity of the nociceptive neurons in the spinal cord in a very powerful way.

- Bringing these modulation systems into play makes it possible to account for classic clinical observations such as the ''absence of a direct relationship between the size of a lesion and the resulting pain'' and, more generally, the influence of psychological, cognitive, contextual and cultural factors on the experience of pain.

- Alterations or dysfunctions in these systems are involved in the pathophysiology of many chronic pain syndromes.<gallery perrow="1">

'''<u>Pathophysiological elements</u>''''

- Classically, we distinguish "3 main types of pain" on a physiopathological basis, even if certain mechanisms (particularly central) are common to these different types of pain. These main types of pain may be associated (e.g. postoperative pain which is typically nociceptive but frequently associated with a neuropathic component).


''Pain caused by excessive nociceptive stimulation'' (or nociceptive pain).

- These pains, secondary to various tissue lesions (trauma, burns, infection, malignant processes, etc.), are the most frequent in clinical practice.

- In this case, the nociceptive systems are intact and it is considered that they are linked to the over-stimulation of these systems, notably due to the inflammatory reactions frequently observed in this context.

- Visceral pain" related to distension of cavities or spasm of smooth muscles (e.g. gastroenteritis, colitis, renal colic, hepatic colic, etc.) is related to pain caused by excess nociception (stretching of the walls, often associated parietal inflammation, etc.).

- Inflammatory processes lead to hyperactivation of the nociceptors (''peripheral sensitisation'') linked to the action of a large number of pro-nociceptive substances (bradykinin, H+ ions, prostaglandins, histamine, substance P, NGF, etc) released during inflammation and liable to directly activate or sensitise the nociceptors.

- Under conditions of inflammation, nociceptors that are normally silent when not stimulated become spontaneously active and their evoked responses are increased and appear with a lower threshold.

- These peripheral mechanisms can secondarily induce central modifications consisting mainly of phenomena of "central sensitisation" and "alterations in modulation systems", which play a decisive role in the perpetuation of certain types of pain and explain certain therapeutic failures aimed solely at acting on peripheral factors.

- The mechanisms of central sensitisation are complex. In particular, they involve NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate) receptors, the activation of which is linked to the significant increase in the central release of glutamate due to the prolonged activation and sensitisation of nociceptors.

- The cascade of intracellular events triggered by the activation of these NMDA receptors is at the origin of a long-lasting hyperexcitability of central nociceptive neurons (''central sensitisation'') which contributes to increasing and amplifying the pain and could account for the transformation of certain acute pains into chronic pains.


'''Neuropathic pain.'''

- They are linked to lesions or diseases of the somato-sensory system and in particular the nociceptive system. They are most often associated with a sensory deficit (deafferentation) and cannot therefore be explained by simple overstimulation of the nociceptors.

- They depend on secondary peripheral and central mechanisms that help to amplify and perpetuate the pain.

- One of the most well-documented peripheral mechanisms is the appearance of '''''ectopic discharges''''', i.e. electrical activity (action potentials) which originate aberrantly at the nerve lesion. These foci of abnormal discharges result from the accumulation at the lesion site of dysfunctional ion channels, in particular certain subtypes of specific sodium channels, whose physiological role is to regulate membrane excitability.

- The profound metabolic changes associated with nerve damage are responsible for a reduction or increase in the synthesis and release of various neurotransmitters and neuropeptides (glutamate, substance P, BDNF, etc.) which are responsible for secondary central changes.

- The central mechanisms are mainly: the development of ''central sensitisation'' phenomena, alterations in modulation systems or neuroplasticity (reorganisation of somato-sensory systems) which contribute to amplifying and perpetuating pain.


'''Nociplastic''' (or dysfunctional) pain

- This is a group of chronic pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia or irritable bowel syndrome, which are characterised by the absence of an identifiable lesion likely to explain the pain.

- The pathophysiology of these pains is less well known, but the best documented hypothesis at present is that they depend mainly on ''alterations in pain control and modulation systems'', with a reduction in inhibitory mechanisms and/or an increase in facilitatory mechanisms.
