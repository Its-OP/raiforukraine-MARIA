There are many different routes of human exposure, some of which are associated with specific pathologies. As far as chemical contamination is concerned, a distinction is made between :

- Inhalation (airborne): the impact of air pollution on the bronchi and lungs. Associated with respiratory diseases and bronchopulmonary cancers, but also with systemic diseases.

- Ingestion (digestive tract): food is often the main route of contamination. Associated with systemic diseases, sometimes localised (colic).

- Dermal contact: associated with specific sources such as cosmetic products or certain occupational exposures. Associated with a number of pathologies, in particular allergies and irritations.

- Placental route: concerns exposure of the embryo and foetus

- The various routes of chemical exposure are associated with barriers (intestinal, cutaneous, placental in particular).

As far as physical exposure is concerned, we should add the auditory pathways for noise (hearing problems) and the visual pathways for radiation, particularly UV radiation (eye diseases).
