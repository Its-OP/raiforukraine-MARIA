If there is any doubt about an environmental or occupational origin, it is recommended that patients be referred to a CRPPE (Regional Centre for Occupational and Environmental Pathologies). There are 30 such centres in France. The list can be found on the Anses website (<nowiki>https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/RNV3P-CPP.pdf</nowiki>).

These centres used to focus on occupational diseases, but since 2021 their remit has been extended to include environmental diseases.

Some of these centres are associated with poison control centres, which have greater expertise in environmental poisoning.
