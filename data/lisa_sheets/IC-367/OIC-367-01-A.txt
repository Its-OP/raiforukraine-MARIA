In the field of environment and health, we can distinguish exposures at different scales:

- Global scale: e.g. climate change or loss of biodiversity

- Local scale: e.g. urban environment, workplace, indoor air, transport, etc.

- Scale of exposure factors: chemical, physical, biological, etc.

From the point of view of human populations and individuals, these different scales result in multiple sources of exposure:

- Non-anthropogenic natural sources: pollens, forest fires, chimney fires, sand winds, moulds, etc.

- Industrial: oil, coal and chemical industries

- Agriculture and food: fertilisers, pesticides, food processing, cooking

- Transport: thermal energy, particles
