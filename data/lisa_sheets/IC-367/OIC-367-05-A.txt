Exposure can be measured either at environmental level near the source or at internal level on human matrices. The former enable a better definition of the source, while the latter enable a better integration of the various exposures at the level of the organism and the role of absorption, transport, metabolism and excretion pathways.  

At the environmental level, there are a number of different tools:

- Satellites: weather, particles (sandstorms), green and blue spaces, etc.

- Environmental detectors: particles, chemicals, noise, UV, etc.

- Individual detectors: chemicals, particles, noise, physiological measurements

On a human level :

- Quantitative measurement of chemical substances of various kinds (metals, organic substances) in biological matrices (blood, urine, hair, skin, meconium) as part of biomonitoring studies or epidemiological or clinical studies.

- Broad-spectrum profile of chemical substances (thousands of substances can be detected) as part of a chemical exposome study.
