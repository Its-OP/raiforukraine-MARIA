Diagnostic wandering: diagnostic wandering is the period between the appearance of the first symptoms and the date on which a precise diagnosis is made ('''[[Rational request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination SD-178|rational request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic examination]]''').

Diagnostic impasse: diagnostic impasse results from the failure to define the precise cause of the disease after having implemented all the investigations available in the state of the art. It concerns patients with an atypical form of a known disease, or a disease whose genetic or other cause has not yet been recognised.
