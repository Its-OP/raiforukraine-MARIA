|Title=Know a few of the most common rare diseases
|Description=Item 45 deals with Trisomy 21, Fragile X syndrome and cystic fibrosis. In this rare diseases item, briefly mention the rare diseases that may be encountered in the career of a general practitioner, in particular haemochromatosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia, thalassaemia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The aim is not to cover all these diseases, but to understand how common they are, the huge diversity of clinical pathways and the need for multidisciplinary follow-up of patients.

'''Haemochromatosis''': A genetic disease caused by excessive intestinal absorption of iron, most often linked to a deficiency in the production of hepcidin, the systemic iron-regulating hormone, and more rarely to hepcidino-resistance. As a result, iron is deposited in various organs such as the liver, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis can lead to chronic fatigue ('''[[Asthenia SD-021|asthenia]]'''), melanoderma and liver damage ('''[[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]]''') (cirrhosis with a risk of hepatocellular carcinoma), diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, ('''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]'''), osteoporosis, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or heart failure. Biochemical abnormalities include elevated transferrin saturation coefficient (reflecting hyperabsorption of iron, and therefore very early onset) and elevated serum ferritin (reflecting visceral iron overload, and therefore secondary onset) (''[[Ferritin: decrease or increase SD-207|ferritin: decrease or increase]]'''). Haemochromatosis linked to the ''HFE'' gene, by far the most common form, is a frequent disease, with around 1 in 200 Caucasians carrying the genetic predisposition (homozygous ''HFE'' C282Y mutation). Its penetrance (probability of expressing the disease) is incomplete and its expressivity (nature of the symptoms presented) variable. Haemochromatosis is as common in men as in women, but is more marked in men. There are rare forms of haemochromatosis that are not linked to the HFE gene. These forms are not exclusive to Caucasian populations; they are often more severe and earlier-onset (they occur before the age of 30 and are sometimes called juvenile haemochromatosis) ([[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|'''Announcement of a chronic disease'']]). Haemochromatosis, which may or may not be linked to the HFE gene, is autosomal recessive, except in the exceptional case of hepcidino-resistance (dominant disease).

'''Haemophilia''' : X-linked genetic disease characterised by spontaneous or prolonged haemorrhage due to a deficiency in factor VIII (haemophilia A, gene ''F8'') or IX (haemophilia B, gene ''F9'') ('''[[Bleeding tendency SD-059|bleeding tendency]], [[Acute haemorrhage SD-060|acute haemorrhage]]'''). The annual incidence is 1 in 5000 male births and the prevalence in the population is estimated at 1/12,000. Haemorrhage usually starts when the child learns to walk. The severity of clinical manifestations depends on the severity of the coagulation factor deficiency: if the biological activity of the coagulation factor is less than 1%, haemophilia is severe. If it is between 1 and 5%, haemophilia is moderate. If it is between 5 and 40%, the haemophilia is minor. Bleeding can occur at any site following trauma, most often in the joints (haemarthrosis) (''[[Joint pain SD-067|joint pain]]''') and muscles (''[[Purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma SD-089|purpura/ecchymosis/haematoma]]'''). To compensate for factor VIII or IX deficiency, a replacement therapy is used, the aim of which is to supply the missing factor to the body: recombinant antihaemophilic factor. It can be administered following a haemorrhage (treatment on demand) or to prevent bleeding (prophylactic treatment). Haemophilia A and B are haemorrhagic diseases, the management of which is the responsibility of the patient's therapeutic education. The most frequent complication is the appearance of antibodies directed against the infused coagulation factor, inhibiting its action (known as inhibitory antibodies). Surgical corrections, particularly orthopaedic, are possible in specialised centres (''[[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]]''').

Sickle cell anaemia: A frequent autosomal recessive genetic disease (around 270 new cases per year in the Ile-de-France region, 400 new cases per year in France), which is serious and mainly affects people of sub-Saharan African and West Indian origin. The prevalence of heterozygotes in Europe is estimated at around 1/150: in Central and West Africa (15-25%), in the American overseas departments (10-12%) and in the Mediterranean regions (1-15%), a high prevalence is observed in areas that are or have been affected by malaria, as this anomaly offers protection against neuromalaria. Sickle cell disease is caused by an abnormality in the haemoglobin ("HBB" gene) which results in the deformation of red blood cells, causing them to lose their rounded shape (false shape). Sickle cell anaemia is a chronic haemolytic disease predisposing to 3 types of acute complications: severe anaemia (''[[Childhood pallor SD-055|childhood pallor]], [[Decreased haemoglobin SD-217|decreased haemoglobin]]''), severe bacterial infections and ischaemic vaso-occlusive accidents (AVO) secondary to conflicts between the small vessels and the red blood cells which are not sufficiently deformable. Various organic complications may also arise. Management must include the prevention of infections, pain ('''[[Assessment and management of acute pain SD-259|assessment and management of acute pain]], [[Assessment and management of chronic pain SDD-260|assessment and management of chronic pain]], [[Assessment and management of pain in children and infants SD-261|assessment and management of pain in children and infants]]'') and any complications, as well as the social and psycho-educational dimension, within multidisciplinary centres equipped with intensive care (immediate access to blood transfusion) ('''[[Announcement of a chronic illness SD-328|announcement of a chronic illness]]'''). Occasional or scheduled transfusion remains an essential therapeutic modality ('''[[Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion]]'')''. The main indication for bone marrow transplantation is the presence of cerebral vasculopathy. Some children with severe sickle cell disease may require intensified treatment: hydroxycarbamide, transfusion programme, haematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene therapy. Systematic neonatal screening SD-308|neonatal screening]'' is offered to at-risk populations.

'''Thalassaemias''': Genetic disorders, most often autosomal recessive, which result in a reduction in the synthesis of globin chains, either alpha (alpha-thalassaemias, ''HBA1'' and ''HBA2'' genes) or beta (beta-thalassaemias, ''HBB'' gene). The imbalance in synthesis between alpha and non-alpha chains causes precipitation of unpaired chains, inefficient erythropoiesis and anaemia ('''[[Child pallor SD-055|child pallor]], [[Haemoglobin decrease SD-217|haemoglobin decrease]]'''). Depending on the degree of anaemia and transfusion requirements, a distinction is made between intermediate thalassaemias with moderate transfusion requirements and major thalassaemias for which regular transfusions are vital (''[[Prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion SD-272|prescribe and carry out a blood transfusion]])''. The prognosis for these forms has been improved by transfusion programmes and iron chelation; given the complexity of the treatment, children are offered a bone marrow transplant with an HLA-compatible related donor (''[[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|announcement of a chronic disease]]'').

'''Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)''': X-linked disease characterised by progressive atrophy and ''[[Muscular weakness SD-074|muscular weakness]]''' due to degeneration of the skeletal, smooth and cardiac muscles. DMD mainly affects boys, and the prevalence of male births is between 1/3,500 and 1/9,300. Muscle damage is caused by the complete absence of dystrophin, due to variants in the "DMD" gene. The disease begins in early childhood, and affected boys may present with neurodevelopmental disorders (after the age of 18 months), language disorders and/or a delay in overall development (''[[Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly SD-115|Psychomotor Developmental Anomaly]]''). Autism and behavioural problems are relatively common. The disease progresses rapidly and the child develops a "waddling" gait and has a positive Gowers sign. Loss of walking occurs between the ages of 6 and 13, with an average of 9.5 years in patients not treated with steroids. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical picture, family history and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels 100 to 200 times higher than normal. Genetic analysis is the reference method. Although the situation is improving thanks to advances in multidisciplinary management and treatment, the prognosis for DMD is severe and life expectancy is significantly reduced, with death occurring early in adulthood (''[[Announcement of a chronic disease SD-328|announcement of a chronic disease]], [[Announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family SD-327|announcement of a diagnosis of a serious illness to the patient and/or family]'').
