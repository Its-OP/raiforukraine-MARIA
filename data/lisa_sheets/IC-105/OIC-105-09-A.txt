'''Syndromes'''' '''special: simple hyperthermic seizure and complicated hyperthermic seizure''''

- Often genetic in origin.

- They meet very strict diagnostic criteria.

- Age of onset after one year.

- [[Convulsions SDD-120|Crisis]] occurring in a context of [[Acute fever in children and adults|fever]] > 37.5Â°C, with symmetrical motor manifestations, lasting less than 15 minutes, without post-critical deficit, remaining unique for a given febrile episode.

- Less than three episodes in total.

- If these conditions are met, there is no indication for further tests, in particular no EEG ([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]), and no indication for long-term anti-epileptic treatment. Prevention is achieved by monitoring hyperthermia.

- When one of these criteria is not met, the seizures are referred to as complicated hyperthermic seizures, in which case an aetiological assessment and background antiepileptic treatment are warranted.  

<br />
====Medial temporal epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis====
- History of complicated hyperthermic seizures frequent but may be absent.

- Age of onset of first non-febrile seizures: 5 to 15 years.

- Predominant seizure types: focal internal temporal seizures (see positive diagnosis above).

- Generally no secondary generalised focal seizures under antiepileptic treatment.

- Prognosis: poor with drugs alone, with frequent drug resistance, but accessible to surgical treatment, which leads to a cure in 70% of cases.

- MRI: appearance of unilateral hippocampal sclerosis.

- Specialist hospital advice (centre of reference or competence for rare epilepsies) is essential as soon as drug resistance is established.
