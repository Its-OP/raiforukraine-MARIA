===Some syndromes to be aware of===

====1.     Childhood absence epilepsy (see dedicated objective)====
- Belongs to generalised epilepsies of presumed genetic origin (= idiopathic)

- Onset age: around 6 years.

- Predominant type of seizures: typical absences (up to 100 per day).

- Other types of associated seizures are possible: [[Convulsions SDD-120|tonic generalised seizures]], rare and never initial in the evolution, myoclonus.

- Prognosis: pharmacosensitive in 80% of cases; treatment can be stopped after puberty.

- EEG essential for diagnosis, very sensitive if a hyperventilation manoeuvre is correctly performed ([[Reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test SD-178|reasoned request/prescription and choice of a diagnostic test]]): synchronised generalised spike-wave discharges at 3 cycles/s, favoured by hyperpnoea.

- It is easily differentiated from temporal lobe focal epilepsies on the basis of the earlier age of onset, the shorter seizure-absence symptomatology, with disturbed consciousness being the predominant or even exclusive sign, present for the entire duration of the seizure, immediate recovery with no post-critical deficit, the presumed genetic aetiology, and the usually very good pharmaco-sensitivity.

====2.     Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy====
- Belongs to the generalised epilepsies of presumed genetic origin (= idiopathic).

- Age of onset: adolescence.

- Predominant type of seizure: morning myoclonic seizures, often photosensitive.

- Other types of associated seizures possible: tonic-clonic generalised seizures, absences.

- Prognosis: drug-sensitive in 80% of cases, but drug-dependent in adulthood (it is rarely possible to stop antiepileptic treatment).

- EEG essential for diagnosis, very sensitive, especially if recorded for a long time and if a hyperventilation manoeuvre is performed correctly (request and prescription reasoned and choice of diagnostic test): synchronised generalised polypointer-wave puffs, favoured by intermittent light stimulation.

====3.     Epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures alone (formerly known as waking seizures)====
- Belongs to the group of generalised epilepsies of presumed genetic origin (=idiopathic).

- Age of onset: adolescence, adulthood.

- A single type of seizure: [[Convulsions SDD-120|généralisée tonicoclonique]], favoured by lack of sleep and alcohol.

- EEG essential for diagnosis but may be normal (request and reasoned prescription and choice of a diagnostic test): spikes and generalised spikes.

- Prognosis: pharmacosensitive in 90% of cases, provided that hygiene rules concerning sleep and alcohol are followed.
