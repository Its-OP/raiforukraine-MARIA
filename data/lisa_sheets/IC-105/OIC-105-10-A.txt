===Care principles===

====A.   Crisis management====
- Note the time of onset ''';''' observe to be able to describe the clinical signs;

- Clear the upper airway (do not put your fingers or any object in your mouth); safety side position (helps to clear the upper airway, prevents inhalation pneumonia in the event of vomiting)

- in the case of known epilepsy, administer a rescue benzodiazepine as prescribed (usually after 5 minutes of tonic-clonic generalised seizure).no systematic hospitalisation.

- in the event of a first or unusual seizure, or if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, call 15

====B.    Management of epilepsy: Discussion of whether or not anti-epileptic treatment is indicated====
- Anti-epileptic treatment should not be started as a matter of course for every first epileptic seizure.

- Only patients with a high risk of recurrence of seizures in the long term should be treated on the basis of rapid specialist advice (within two weeks), but this should not be done as an emergency in the emergency department.

- This treatment must be introduced after clear information has been provided and with the agreement of the adult patient (or family in the case of children). The patient must understand the expected risks and benefits.

- The choice of medication will take into account the epileptic syndrome and the patient's characteristics.<br />
