The description "generalised/partial, idiopathic/lesional seizures" has not been included, as this terminology is obsolete and has been abandoned.         

==Syndromic classification and diagnosis===
A syndrome is defined as a non-random association of elementary clinical or paraclinical signs. The identification of an epileptic syndrome is used to guide etiological research, the choice of antiepileptic treatment and to formulate a prognosis for the evolution of the epilepsy and any associated psychiatric or cognitive [[Situation of disability SDD-345|handicap]].

===A.     Principles of syndromic classification===
Syndromes are defined according to :

- age of onset of seizures ;

- predominant type(s) of crisis ;

- intercritical EEG (always) and critical EEG (sometimes);

- neurological examination (normal, or focal signs in focal forms);

- neuropsychological examination (normal or more or less marked deficits in focal epilepsies, genetic generalised epilepsies, or even developmental disorders in epileptic encephalopathies);

- prognosis.

===B.    Some syndromes to be aware of (see specific dedicated objectives) ===
1.     Epilepsy - child's absence

2.    Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy

3.     Epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizures alone (formerly known as waking seizures)

4.    West syndrome

5.    Special syndromes: simple hyperthermic crisis and complicated hyperthermic crisis

6.    Medial temporal epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis
