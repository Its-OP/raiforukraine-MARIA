====West syndrome====
- Age-related epileptic encephalopathy which belongs to the groups of epilepsies with generalised seizures or with focal seizures or of unknown onset, and whose aetiologies may also be diverse (presumed genetic, structural, etc.) including tuberous sclerosis of Bourneville and trisomy 21.

- Starting age: 6 months, before 1 year.

- Flexion spasms are the most common type of seizure.

- Defined by the triad of flexion spasms, psychomotor regression and EEG hypsarrhythmia.

- Prognosis variable, but with a high risk of drug resistance and permanent developmental disorders.

- Prompt hospital referral is essential in order to confirm the positive diagnosis (EEG-video), carry out the aetiological work-up and start therapeutic treatment as soon as possible.
