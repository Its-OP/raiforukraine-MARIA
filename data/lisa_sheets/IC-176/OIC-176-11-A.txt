'''<big>Adult</big>''''

Oral: intake of water, glucose and electrolytes and anti-diarrhoea diet (cooked fruit, cooked vegetables with little fibre, prefer pasta, rice, white bread and potatoes, and bananas, avoid dairy products).

If signs of seriousness, dehydration > 8% of body weight, or significant vomiting: infusion adapted to kalaemia; supply of 50% of volume loss over the first 6 hours then 50% over the remaining 18 hours.

Symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea: antisecretory agents (racecadotril, acetorphan) possible; loperamide contraindicated if dysenteric syndrome.

'''<big>Child's home</big>''''

The main risk of acute diarrhoea in children is dehydration (cf [[Acute diarrhoea and dehydration in infants, children and adults|item 286]]). It is therefore important to prevent both dehydration and malnutrition.

Prevention/treatment of dehydration

- Rehydration should be oral whenever possible (weight loss < 10% of body weight and no sign of hypovolaemia) ''with an oral rehydration solution (ORS),'' with fractions if vomiting occurs (see item 286).

- in the event of failure of oral rehydration with ORS or initial signs of severity (weight loss > 10%, hypovolaemia): inpatient intravenous rehydration (after vascular filling in the event of hypovolaemia (haemodynamic disorders) - physiological serum NaCL 9â€° 20ml/kg) with isotonic polyionic glucose solution at least 4g/L of NacL (beware of correcting hypernatraemia too quickly and the risk of cerebral oedema, so importance of monitoring natraemia). The flow rate is 150ml/kg/d in infants, 100 to 120ml/kg/d thereafter, to be adapted to losses and progress (weight, diuresis) then ORS relay according to progress after at least 6 hours.

- if the oral route fails and the approach is difficult

           - or signs of hypovolaemia, in which case the intraosseous line should be filled and then infused

           - or no haemodynamic problems: trial of enteral ORS via a nasogastric tube (200ml/kg/d to be adapted).

Prevention of undernutrition

'''Do not stop feeding''': alternate feedings and ORS if breast-feeding, resume milk-based feeding (other than breast milk) within 4 to 6 hours of starting ORS rehydration with previous milk (lactose-free only if severe and/or persistent), continue previous diversified diet (no diet).

'''Symptomatic treatment'''

They are only moderately effective and should not be prescribed at the expense of ORS, i.e. as a second-line treatment, after ORS +++.

Marketing authorisation for children: diosmectite and racecadrotil
