In children, viral watery diarrhoea is often accompanied by fever (especially rotavirus).

Clostridium difficile diarrhoea is rare in children and (almost) non-existent before the age of 4 because of the absence of a toxin receptor. On the other hand, children are readily colonised by C. difficile, including toxin-secreting organisms. it is therefore unnecessary to test young children for C. difficile.
