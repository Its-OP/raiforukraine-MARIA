Rectosigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy: to visualise suggestive lesions (pseudomembranes of C difficile colitis) and take biopsies.

Indications: persistent diarrhoea with no identified cause despite the work-up described above, or in cases of immunodepression with no identified aetiology for the diarrhoea.

Endoscopic examination is rarely indicated in children and is subject to specialist paediatric advice.
