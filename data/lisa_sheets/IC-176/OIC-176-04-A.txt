There are a number of factors in the history that can point to a particular pathogen:

'''The context'''

*in a humanitarian context, Vibrio cholera
*in a TIAC context, ''Bacillus cereus,'' in addition to those in the table.

'''The patient's age'''

*In children, watery diarrhoea should first point to a viral cause (most often rotavirus), while invasive diarrhoea (bloody stools, general signs) should point to a bacterial cause ('Salmonella non'' Typhi, ''Shigella spp'', ''Campylobacter jejuni'', ''Yersinia spp'' (most often ''Y. enterocolitica''), ''E. coli EHEC'')
*Regardless of age, or in elderly people living in institutions, norovirus is most common.
*Certain circumstances, such as contact with cold-blooded animals (tortoises, reptiles), can lead to infection with non-typhi Salmonella.

'''The incubation period,'''

*short (24 to 48 hours) for ''Salmonella non'' typhi, ''Shigella spp'', rotavirus, norovirus
*longer (7 days on average) for Salmonella typhi and paratyphi, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia spp.

'''The offending food''' :

Consumption of undercooked minced beef or unpasteurised dairy products can lead to infection with enterohaemorrhagic E.coli (EHEC, in particular O157H7), which can cause haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).

Poultry consumption: Campylobacter jejuni

Any food contaminated by handling or contaminated water (enteric viruses, most frequently norovirus)
