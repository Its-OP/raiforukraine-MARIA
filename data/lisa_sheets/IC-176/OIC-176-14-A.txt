Primary prevention of infectious diarrhoea involves "good hand hygiene" before meals and after using the toilet, in all circumstances, given the frequency with which children put their hands to their mouths.

In addition, food must be well preserved, respecting the cold chain, and in tropical areas, be sure to drink treated (boiled) or mineral water and eat food that is cooked and hot, or washed and peeled if raw.

In the event of hospitalisation, ''additional contact precautions'' are necessary to avoid cross-transmission (reinforced (type 2) in the event of ''C. difficile'' infection. C. difficile spores are resistant to hydroalcoholic solutions, so hand washing with soap must precede the application of SHA in this situation).

Eviction from the community is indicated in cases of shigellosis, enterohaemorrhagic E.coli, Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi.

Vaccinations

- There is a specific anti-rotavirus vaccination for children before the age of 6 months (live oral vaccines with a 2- or 3-dose schedule; risk of acute intestinal intussusception higher if administered after the age of 6 months), which is widely recommended in European countries, with an impact on severe forms of the disease and hospitalisations, even in older children (under 5 years old). This vaccine is not recommended in France in 2021. It may be prescribed but will not be reimbursed.

'''-'''' Anti-typhoid vaccines: in 2021, 2 types of vaccine will be available in France:

A monovalent Typhim<sup>R</sup> typhoid fever vaccine, composed of Vi capsular polyosides from a strain of Salmonella typhi, can be used in adults and children over 2 years of age.

It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the constituents.

Typhoid fever-Hepatitis A vaccine: this vaccine is composed of capsular polyosides Vi from a strain of Salmonella typhi and inactivated hepatitis A virus. It is contraindicated in the event of allergy to one of the components.  It may be used in patients aged 16 and over.

For these two vaccines, seroprotection against typhoid decreases rapidly during the first year (around 40% of those vaccinated are protected after one year, outside endemic areas). A booster is indicated between 24 and 36 months after the first injection for Typhim<sup>R</sup> and after 36 months for Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, if protection against typhoid fever is still required. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given as early as one year after the first injection of Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup> depending on the risk of contamination.

Under the age of 2, none of these vaccines induces an effective immune response. As far as hepatitis A is concerned, a booster can be given in the first year of life, either with a hepatitis A vaccine or with Tyavax<sup>R</sup>, depending on the risk of acquiring typhoid.
