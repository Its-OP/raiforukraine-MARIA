'''In children:''''

Diarrhoea is defined as the frequent and abundant passing of soft or liquid stools. Acute diarrhoea is defined by a duration of less than or equal to 1 week. Chronic diarrhoea occurs after 3 weeks.

'''In adults:'''

The definition of diarrhoea is quantitative: in adults, it means a frequency of unformed stools > 3 times per 24 hours and/or a quantity of stools > 250g/24 hours.

Diarrhoea is classified as acute if it lasts less than 2 weeks, chronic if it lasts more than 4 weeks and prolonged if it lasts between 2 and 4 weeks.
