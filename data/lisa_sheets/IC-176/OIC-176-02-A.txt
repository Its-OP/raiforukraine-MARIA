'''Main causes by age'''

<u>Main causes in adults</u>:

*Infectious diseases (including [[Food and water-related health risks. Food Toxi-Infections|TIAC]], see item 179): the vast majority are
*functional
*medicinal, in particular diarrhoea caused by dysbiosis due to antibiotics.
*Inflammatory: chronic inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease).
*other: endocrine causes, tumours, malabsorption, etc.

<u>Main causes in children:</u>

*infectious causes of viral origin are the most frequent, followed by diarrhoea of bacterial origin
*non-infectious causes of diarrhoea: allergy (cow's milk protein: see item 285 [[Chronic diarrhoea in adults and children|chronic diarrhoea]]), side effects of medication (antibiotics in particular), inflammation (rarer than in adults).


'''Diarrhoea of infectious origin includes'' :

*viral diarrhoea (secretory)
*bacterial diarrhoea (secretory or not)
*parasitic diarrhoea (non-toxigenic)


Infectious agents of diarrhoea and TIAC are transmitted'' :

*by hand, facilitated by inadequate hygiene of the hands on which pathogens are found
*ingestion of food, water or contact with the environment contaminated with pathogens


'''The mechanisms of diarrhoea of infectious origin (and therefore of TIAC) fall into 2 types'' :

*secretory mechanism (loss of water and electrolytes), by production of a toxin by the pathogen or by a mechanism which disrupts the reabsorption of water and electrolytes
*invasive mechanism (invasion of the mucosa), with cellular destruction (dysenteric syndrome), or without cellular destruction (gastroenteric syndrome), by pathogens
