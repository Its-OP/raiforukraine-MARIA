Digestive parasites: giardiosis, amoebiasis, tapeworms, ascariasis, pinworms|parasites]] with a digestive tropism cause diarrhoea that is more or less prolonged or intermittent, but not febrile (see tem [[172]]).

The parasites most frequently found are "Giardia intestinalis" (more frequent in children - epidemics in groups of children - and in adults, often post-travel, with family cases), "Cryptosporidium" spp, and microsporidia.

When travelling, other parasites may be considered, including intestinal amoebiasis, cyclosporiasis, anguillosis, ascariasis, hookworm infection, trichocephaliasis and taeniasis.

In cases of HIV immunosuppression, and where cryptosporidiosis and microsporidiosis have been ruled out, a search should be made for "Cystoisospora belli" cystoisosporosis.
