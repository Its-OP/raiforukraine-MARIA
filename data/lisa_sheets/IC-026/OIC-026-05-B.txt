==Ultrasound==
- Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound is not very effective in pregnancy.

- Moderate pyelocalic dilation < 20 mm is frequently observed during pregnancy, particularly on the right, due to dextro-rotation of the uterus.

==Radio and CT scans
- An injected CT scan is possible at any stage of pregnancy, but contrast product injections should be avoided in the early months of pregnancy and when breast-feeding.           (Risk-benefit ratio)

- No radiological diagnostic examination exceeds a dose of 100mGy.  A dose of less than 100 mGy has no harmful effect and does not justify termination of pregnancy.  

- Usual examinations not reaching the value of 100 mGy: chest X-ray (max <0.01), abdomen (max: 4.2 mGy) films taken on an upper/lower limb, a thoracic angio-scanner. For the abdomino-pelvic scanner, the average dose is 8 mGy and the maximum dose is 49 mGy. The patient should be kept informed.

- The risk of childhood cancer following foetal irradiation has not been demonstrated at the doses used in diagnostic imaging.

==MRI==
- MRI can be carried out on pregnant women, but it is advisable to avoid the first trimester of pregnancy and to limit injections of contrast products, including when breast-feeding. (Benefit/risk ratio)
