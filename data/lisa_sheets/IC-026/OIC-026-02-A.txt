== '''Threat of premature delivery''' ==

===Definition===
- Association of [[Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman SD-098|uterine contractions]] regular and painful associated with cervical changes before 37 SA (between 22 SA and 36 SA and 6 days).

===Clinical diagnosis===
- Association of regular, painful uterine contractions associated with cervical changes on vaginal examination before 37 weeks' gestation.

Measurement of cervical length and the appearance of the uterine orifice on vaginal ultrasound are prognostic factors for the threat of premature delivery.

===Etiological and maternal-fetal impact assessment===
o Vaginal swab for bacteriological analysis, [[Analysis of a urine cytobacteriological examination (ecbu) SD-189|ECBU]]

o Fetal heart rate recording

o Fetal ultrasound: vitality, amount of fluid, placental location

           



           

==Gynaecological causes
To be considered in the presence of acute pelvic pain

===Uterus
- Aseptic necrobiosis of fibroid

Diagnosis

- Abdominal or pelvic pain, depending on the term, permanent, spontaneous

- Rarely accompanied by fever, but CRP may be elevated<br />.

===Appendices===
- Cyst torsion [[Pelvic mass SD-106]]

- Haemorrhagic or non-haemorrhagic cyst rupture

- Intracystic haemorrhage

Diagnosis

- Sudden onset of pain sometimes accompanied by vagal discomfort

- Signs of peritoneal irritation

There is no endometritis or salpingitis during pregnancy
<br />

==Urological causes ==
Identical diagnostic criteria for pregnant and non-pregnant women

- Renal colic

- Lower urinary tract infection

- Upper urinary tract infection

Diagnosis

- Sudden onset of pain in the iliac fossa, aggravated by palpation of the kidney

- Urinary incontinence SD-096|Urinary incontinence

- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever]] in cases of upper urinary tract infection

Frequent association: urinary tract infection and PAD / urinary tract infection and diabetes
<br />

=='''Digestive causes'''==
Identical diagnostic criteria for pregnant and non-pregnant women (see specific questions)

Pregnancy can mask abdominal pain

- Appendicitis

Diagnosis

- [[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|Fever]] and left iliac fossa pain, but the position of the appendix may be altered by pregnancy, especially in the 3rd<sup>trimester.

- [[Leukocyte abnormality SD-216|Hyperleukocytosis]] and increased neutrophil counts are physiological during pregnancy, which can complicate the diagnosis [[Acute or chronic inflammatory syndrome SD-186]].

- Based on ultrasound, but do not hesitate to use an abdominopelvic scanner

- Risk of miscarriage and prematurity (sepsis, pain, inflammation)


- Peritonitis

- Cholecystitis

- Liver colic

- Acute hepatitis

- Constipation

- Occlusion

- Acute gastroenteritis

- Gastritis, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer disease
