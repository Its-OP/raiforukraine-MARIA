== Interrogatory
o how long the thrombocytopenia has existed, by recovering previous counts;

o family history: notion of familial thrombocytopenia?

o personal history: liver disease? haemopathy? cancer? autoimmune disease? immune deficiency/repeated infections?

o consumption of drugs, particularly alcohol;

o the use of medication, particularly recently introduced in the weeks preceding the onset of thrombocytopenia;

o the existence of risk behaviour and exposure to HCV or HIV;

o the existence of an active pregnancy;

o the notion of travel: exposure to malaria? to dengue?

o the occurrence of a recent episode of viral or bacterial infection: fever? flu-like syndrome?

Assessment of severity and aetiological orientation

o peripheral adenopathies '''([[Single or multiple adenopathies SD-016|single or multiple adenopathies]]''') (lymphoid haemopathies, viral infections, systemic lupus...) ;

o '''[[Splenomegaly SD-058|splenomegaly]]''' (cirrhosis and other causes of portal hypertension, lymphoid haemopathies, myeloproliferative syndromes, viral infections, lupus, etc.);

o ''[[Hepatomegaly SD-006|hepatomegaly]]''' (hepatopathies, lymphomas...), and signs of portal hypertension ;

o '''[[Hyperthermia/fever SD-044|fever]]''' (progressive infection, lymphoma, cancer or systemic lupus in relapse...);

o any other clinical indication (skin rash and angina in the case of a viral infection, characteristic skin rash and arthralgias in the case of systemic lupus, etc.).
