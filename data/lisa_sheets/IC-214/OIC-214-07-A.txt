== Visceral haemorrhagic accidents

=== Rare but serious (life-threatening or life-sustaining) ===
- serious because of the location of the bleeding

* cerebral-meningeal haemorrhage''([[Headache SD-118|headache]],'' nausea/vomiting, vigilance disorders''([[Coma and consciousness disorders SD-028|coma and consciousness disorders]]'''), or '''[[Sensory and/or motor neurological deficit SD-121|sensory and/or motor neurological deficit]] =>''' emergency brain imaging)

- serious because of the repercussions

* acute haemorrhage'', or even haemorrhagic shock: for example digestive haemorrhage (''discharge of blood from the mouth, melena/rectorrhagia''), urinary haemorrhage (''haematuria'') or genital haemorrhage (''abnormal genital bleeding (unknown pregnancy)'')

<br />

=== Most often when platelet count is < 10 G/L ===
However, higher platelet counts may occur in the case of the "aggravating" factors mentioned above (advanced age, poorly controlled arterial hypertension, underlying lesion at risk of bleeding, treatment interacting with haemostasis/coagulation, particularly anti-coagulant treatment).

Unprovoked and confluent haematomas, other than those of the lower limbs, visceral haemorrhages or continuous haemorrhages at the puncture sites should suggest a coagulation anomaly associated with thrombocytopenia (DIC in particular).
<br />

== Prodromes
Marked mucocutaneous haemorrhagic syndrome = precedes serious haemorrhagic events.

These "warning signs" are listed in the table below.

'''Table: Haemorrhagic manifestations to be considered as warning signs that should raise fears of serious visceral haemorrhage.'''
{| class="wikitable"
|'''Clinical warning signs for a risk of serious haemorrhage'''
|-
|Intraoral haemorrhagic bubbles
|-
|Significant spontaneous gingivorrhage
|-
|Epistaxis, especially bilateral
|-
|Breakthrough bleeding
|-
|Extensive or even disseminated ecchymotic purpura, especially if associated with significant mucosal haemorrhage
|-
|Headaches which, even if isolated, should be investigated for cerebro-meningeal haemorrhage and a brain scan performed as a matter of urgency.
