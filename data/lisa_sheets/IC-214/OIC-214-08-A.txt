If thrombocytopenia without any mucocutaneous haemorrhagic signs

* ensure the absence of platelet aggregates by agglutination in the presence of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) (the anticoagulant routinely used in haemogram tubes)
* Aggregates lead to an underestimation of the platelet count, known as "false thrombocytopenia".
* the count should be checked under the microscope (looking for platelet aggregates on the blood smear) ('''[[Prescription and analysis of blood smear SD-222|prescription and analysis of blood smear]]''') and checked on a citrate tube => normal platelet count.


In the event of false thrombocytopenia (laboratory artefact)

* no haemorrhagic signs
* no further investigations are necessary.
