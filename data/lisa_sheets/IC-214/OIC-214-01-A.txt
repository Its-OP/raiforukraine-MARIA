Thrombocytopenia = blood platelet count less than 150 G/L (or 150,000/mm<sup>3</sup> or 150 x10<sup>9</sup>/L depending on the units used) (''[[Platelet abnormality SD-215|platelet abnormality]]'').

It is therefore based on the ''''[[Interpretation of the SD-223 blood count|interpretation of the blood count]]'''.
