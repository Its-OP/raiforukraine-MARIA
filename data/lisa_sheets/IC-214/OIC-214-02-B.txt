== ''3 main mechanisms of thrombocytopenia'' ==

# platelet production defect'' by the bone marrow (= causes of so-called "central" thrombocytopenia), related to a quantitative or qualitative bone marrow insufficiency, or related to bone marrow invasion by abnormal cells or fibrosis
# destruction or consumption of platelets in the periphery (= so-called "peripheral" thrombocytopenia). In these situations, the bone marrow produces platelets but these are consumed (disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic microangiopathies) or destroyed (immunological or immuno-allergic mechanisms) in the peripheral blood.
# ''sequestration of platelets in the spleen'' (known as ''hypersplenism''), which may occur in all cases of splenomegaly, and is more marked the larger the spleen.
