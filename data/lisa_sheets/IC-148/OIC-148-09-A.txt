Acute ethmoiditis in the fluxionary stage can be treated on an outpatient basis without further investigation, provided that the patient understands the monitoring instructions and is followed up in consultation.

Acute ethmoiditis in children and infants is a "medical emergency, sometimes surgical". It requires "immediate hospitalisation" for imaging (CT scan), introduction of broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy (combination of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid with high doses of amoxicillin or C3G (if allergic to penicillin) + aminoside in the event of sepsis) and surgical drainage in the event of a complicated form (retro septal or intraorbital collection).
