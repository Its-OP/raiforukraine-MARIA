'''Acute rhinitis in adults:'''

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Clinical diagnosis, '''no further investigations'''. Symptomatology:

Ø Clear then purulent rhinorrhea

Ø Nasal obstruction

Ø Epidemic context

These symptoms may be associated with a flu-like syndrome (moderate fever < 3 days, myalgias, headache) and a cough. Symptoms and impact vary from one individual to another, and from one episode to another.

The outcome is favourable in 99% of cases within 10 to 15 days. In the event of fever > 3 days, a bacterial complication should be suspected.

'''Acute rhinitis in infants:'''

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Touches children under 6 months of age, with exclusive nasal breathing.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Varying symptomatology: from simple intermittent bilateral nasal obstruction with rhinorrhea to '''respiratory distress requiring hospitalization.'''

<nowiki>*</nowiki>From a typical, non-severe form: clinical diagnosis, '''no further investigation'''.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Before a severe form (respiratory distress) look for differential diagnosis: choanal atresias, piriform orifices hypoplasia, other facial malformations.

'''Allergic rhinitis:'''

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Clinical suspicion in the presence of:

o Nasal obstruction

o Abundant clear rhinorrhea

o Sneezing in bursts

o Seasonal rhinitis (usually in spring) or perennial rhinitis

o Possible bilateral conjunctivitis and/or associated asthma symptoms

<nowiki>*</nowiki>On questioning: look for atopic terrain, exposure to an allergen

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Conduct additional tests if necessary to confirm hypersensitivity, allergological opinion, skin tests, specific IgE assay.
