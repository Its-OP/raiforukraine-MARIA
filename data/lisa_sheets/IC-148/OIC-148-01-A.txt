'''Acute rhinitis: inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavities,'' generally manifested by nasal obstruction, a uni or bilateral nasal discharge which is initially clear then muco-purulent, a cough, an influenza-like syndrome with headache and aches, and little or no fever. It is a highly contagious epidemic, occurring mainly in autumn and winter. The intensity of symptoms and the length of time they last vary from person to person and from episode to episode in the same person (generally 5 to 20 days).

Acute rhinopharyngitis: simultaneous inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavities and oropharynx, generally manifested by mucopurulent rhinorrhoea associated with pharyngeal erythema, cough, bilateral inflammatory and tender cervical adenopathy, and little or no fever. Its aetiology and course are the same as those of acute rhinitis.

'''Acute sinusitis: inflammation of the mucosa of one or more sinus cavities (maxillary, frontal, ethmoidal and/or sphenoidal).''' Differential diagnosis with viral rhinopharyngitis can be difficult due to the similarity of symptoms. Complications are rare, but potentially serious. Sinusitis is rare in children because of their anatomical development, except for the ethmoid.

It is important to note that pneumatisation of the sinuses occurs progressively in children: the ethmoid in the first few months of life, the maxilla around the age of 3-4, the frontal sinus between the ages of 5 and 10 and the sphenoid between the ages of 10 and 15. Before pneumatisation, there is never any sinusitis, so there is no maxillary sinusitis in infants!
