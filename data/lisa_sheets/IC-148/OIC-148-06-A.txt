*Acute ethmoiditis is more common in children than adults and can occur as early as 6 months of age. It is rare, but carries a risk of serious complications. It generally occurs after acute rhinopharyngitis.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Clinical: 2 forms are distinguished according to the stage of evolution: the fluxionary stage (pre-septal involvement) and the collected stage (orbital)

Fluxionary stage

Ø Low fever, no AEG

Ø Painful unilateral palpebral oedema with effacement of the medial canthus, opening remains possible, the eye is mobile, calm and painless to move.

At this stage, no further examination is required


Collected or suppurated stage =

Ø High fever (39 to 40°C)

Ø Painful palpebral oedema, predominating in the internal angle of the orbit and the upper eyelid.

Ø painful mobilisation of the eyeball, chemosis, exophthalmos

Ø Headache, prostration

Ø Possible unilateral nasal discharge (inconsistent)

Ø In extreme cases: mydriasis, immobility of the eyeball, abolition of the corneal reflex = ABSOLUTE EMERGENCY (functional prognosis +++)

<nowiki>*</nowiki>Realisation of an '''emergency''' injected sinus CT scan for diagnostic confirmation and search for complications (periorbital collection).
