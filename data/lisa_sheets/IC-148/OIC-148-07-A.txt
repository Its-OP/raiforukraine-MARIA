Antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of rhinitis and acute nasopharyngitis, which are viral infections. Treatment is symptomatic:

Ø Analgesics/antipyretics: paracetamol

Ø Nasal cavity washed with saline solution


Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, vasoconstrictors (local or systemic), antihistamines and corticoids (local or systemic) are not indicated due to their unfavourable benefit-risk balance.
