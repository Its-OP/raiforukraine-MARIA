The onset of chronic sinusitis is '''favoured by''':

Ø Inappropriate treatment during an acute episode

Ø Recurrent acute episodes

Ø Local anatomical factors (dental granuloma, dental amalgam in the back of a maxillary sinus, malformations, septal deviation, foreign bodies, tumour).

Ø Terrain (allergies, nasosinus polyposis)

Ø Environmental factors (pollution, air conditioning, smoking...)


As well as the usual bacteria (streptococcus, staphylococcus, haemophilus influenzae, etc.), the germs involved include anaerobes, BGN and moulds (most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus).


If the patient presents with chronic sinusitis, a CT scan of the sinuses should be performed, and a dental check-up carried out if maxillary sinusitis is present.
