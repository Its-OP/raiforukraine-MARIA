A sinus CT scan is systematically indicated in cases of suspected ethmoidal, frontal or sphenoidal sinusitis for diagnostic confirmation and to screen for complications.


A sinus CT scan is not indicated for acute maxillary sinusitis unless there is a suspected complication, or more rarely if there is diagnostic doubt or antibiotic therapy has failed to confirm the diagnosis.

If a dental cause is suspected, the dental examination is completed by a dental panoramic or a Dentascan.


No imaging test is indicated for acute rhinopharyngitis or rhinitis.

X-rays are never indicated in children if sinus infection is suspected. The CT scan must take into account the variations in pneumatisation of the sinus cavities with age.
