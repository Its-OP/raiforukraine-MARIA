Clinical diagnosis, '''no further investigations necessary''. Symptomatology :

Ø Clear then purulent rhinorrhea

Ø Nasal obstruction

Ø Pharyngeal erythema, pharyngeal discomfort

Ø Epidemic context

These symptoms may be associated with a flu-like syndrome (moderate fever < 3 days, myalgias, headache) and a cough. Symptoms and impact vary from one individual to another, and from one episode to another.

The outcome is favourable in 99% of cases within 10 to 15 days. In the event of fever > 3 days, a bacterial complication should be suspected: otitis, sinusitis.
