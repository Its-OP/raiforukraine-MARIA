Iron is absorbed by enterocytes in the duodenum and proximal jejunum and then exported to the blood via ferroportin. Under physiological conditions, the rate of iron absorption is low, with only 10% absorbed.


The main hormone regulating iron metabolism is hepcidin. This peptide, synthesised by the liver, degrades ferroportin, thereby blocking the release of iron from macrophages and enterocytes, inhibiting iron absorption.
