'''In adults'''

The first step is to treat the cause of iron loss or malabsorption whenever possible. It is also important to ensure an adequate dietary intake of iron.

The reference treatment is oral martial supplementation with iron salts, for a minimum of 3 months and up to 6 months. Treatment is discontinued once ferritin levels have returned to normal, and should not be checked before 3 months of treatment. Possible side-effects of oral iron treatment include black stools and digestive problems.

Intravenous martial supplementation is indicated in cases where the oral form is contraindicated or intolerant, or where iron stocks need to be replenished rapidly.


'''In children'''

Curative treatment

Treating the cause

Correcting dietary errors

Iron supplementation for 3 to 6 months.  Parents and children must be informed of the potential side effects: black stools, digestive problems.

Preventive treatment

* Systematic iron supplementation for premature babies and exclusively or predominantly breastfed infants after the age of 6 months;
* consumption of at least three bottles of follow-on formula (700 ml per day) up to the age of 1 year;
* consumption of growing-up milk until at least 3 years of age
* consumption of two meat products a day as soon as growing-up milk is stopped. <ref>[https://www.pedia-univ.fr/deuxieme-cycle/referentiel/hematologie-cancerologie/anemie-pathologies-du-fer Chapter anaemia and iron pathologies.Paediatrics, 8th edition, by Grégoire Benoist, Antoine Bourrillon, Christophe Delacourt and Christèle Gras-Le Guen.
