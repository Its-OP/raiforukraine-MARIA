These are the differential diagnoses for other microcytic anaemias.


- Inflammatory anaemia

A prolonged inflammatory syndrome, whatever its origin, leads to moderate anaemia with hyposideraemia, but this is predominantly normocytic (in 80% of cases).

There is a clinical context of inflammation and a biological inflammatory syndrome (increased CRP). Ferritin levels are increased, while total transferrin binding capacity is reduced.

Variations in martial status in cases of martial deficiency or inflammatory syndrome are shown in Table 1.

- Haemoglobinopathies

These are essentially minor or heterozygous thalassaemias. Elements pointing towards this diagnosis are geographical origin, increased serum iron and pseudo-polyglobulia (high red blood cell count with a subnormal haemoglobin level).

The diagnosis is confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis in beta-thalassaemia.

Such an anomaly does not justify any treatment and, in particular, no administration of iron.
