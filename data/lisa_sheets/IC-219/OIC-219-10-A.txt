The elements involved in iron metabolism that can be measured in the blood are :

- Serum iron

- Transferrin. Two elements are calculated from the transferrin assay:

o The total iron-binding capacity of transferrin

o The transferrin saturation coefficient, which is the ratio of serum iron to the total iron-binding capacity of transferrin.

- Plasma ferritin


''In the first instance, plasma ferritin alone is sufficient to diagnose martial deficiency''. In the presence of an inflammatory syndrome, chronic renal failure or when the ferritinemia result is non-contributory (normal or elevated value when there is a strong suspicion of iron deficiency), serum iron combined with the transferrin saturation coefficient can help with the diagnosis.

The determination of serum iron alone and the combination of serum iron and serum ferritin without the transferrin saturation coefficient are not recommended.

Iron, transferrin and transferrin saturation coefficient tests must be performed on an empty stomach.
