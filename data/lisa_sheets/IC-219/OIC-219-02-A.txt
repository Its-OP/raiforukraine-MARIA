Iron overload is an excessive accumulation of iron in the body.

This excess can be linked to :

- excessive parenteral nutrition (multiple transfusions),

- excessive release of iron from erythrocytes (haemolysis or dyserythropoiesis),
 
- excessive intestinal absorption, whether or not associated with excessive macrophagic release of iron (mainly linked to haemochromatosis).

The iron will then accumulate in various organs, a toxic process due to the ability of free iron to react with oxygen and form free radicals.


The diagnosis of iron overload is based on :

- as a 1st-line treatment, plasma measurement of martial status markers (ferritin and transferrin saturation coefficient);

- in 2nd intention, possibly on imaging tests (non-injected hepatic MRI with measurement of intra-hepatic iron concentration).



''Attention ''

Hyperferritinaemia is very common and is not necessarily linked to iron overload.
 
The four main causes of hyperferritinaemia are :

- inflammatory syndrome (normal transferrin saturation coefficient, no iron overload)

- hepatic or muscular cytolysis or haemolysis (normal transferrin saturation coefficient, no iron overload)

- chronic alcohol intoxication (normal transferrin saturation coefficient and no iron overload, except in cases of cirrhosis)

- metabolic syndrome (normal transferrin saturation coefficient, no or low iron overload)


In the presence of hyperferritinaemia, the clinical approach is as follows:

1/ A first-line laboratory work-up consists of eliminating the most common causes of hyperferritinaemia, as listed above: blood count, CRP, liver function tests, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, CPK, reticulocytes, haptoglobin.

2/ Once these common causes have been eliminated, a saturation coefficient is measured fasting (threshold value 45%).
