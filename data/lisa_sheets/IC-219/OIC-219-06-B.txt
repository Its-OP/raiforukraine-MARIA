The clinical signs of iron overload are related to the infiltration of iron into certain organs. In the case of genetic haemochromatosis, clinical signs appear around the age of 30 in men and later in women who are naturally protected by the physiological blood loss during menstruation.


The early signs are :

- Chronic asthenia

- Osteoarticular damage

- Inflammatory poly- or oligo-destructive arthritis, predominantly in the distal joints of the hand, but may also affect other joints (toes, wrist, hip, knee, shoulder). Pseudogout-like attacks may occur.


The late signs are :

- Liver damage

- The most frequent abnormality is a moderate, isolated increase in transaminases, predominantly ALT, generally less than 3 times normal.

- Hepatomegaly may be marked.

- It may progress to cirrhosis with portal hypertension and/or hepatocellular failure.

- Cardiac damage

- Dilated cardiomyopathy with cardiomegaly, rarely restrictive, potentially responsible for rhythm disorders and heart failure.

- Endocrine damage

- Hypogonadism with depilation and impotence.

- Diabetes, occurring at a late stage in the disease.

- Other endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency), usually of central origin, are exceptional.

- Melanoderma, which has now become exceptional
