Martial deficiency is a lack of iron, which may be linked to a lack of intake, a lack of absorption or excessive loss of iron.

Martial deficiency is the most widespread nutritional deficiency in the world. In countries with a high socio-economic level, deficiency in adults is due in 90% of cases to excess loss through chronic bleeding. In France, martial deficiency affects 25% of women during the reproductive period.

As martial deficiency is associated with non-specific clinical signs, diagnosis is based on plasma levels of martial markers.
