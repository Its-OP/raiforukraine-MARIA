'''In adults'''


Haemochromatosis is suspected in cases of hyperferritinaemia and a transferrin saturation coefficient of more than 45%. Genetic haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by progressive iron overload in the body due to a defect in the negative regulation of intestinal iron absorption. It is caused by a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, which is homozygous in 70-95% of people with the disease. Other mutations are much rarer.

Its prevalence in France is around 5 per thousand, and a heterozygous C282Y mutation is observed in 5 to 10% of the general population, more frequently in people of Breton origin.


The causes of hyperferritinaemia according to the presence or absence of iron overload are shown in Table 2.

* Metabolic syndrome may be responsible for isolated hyperferritinaemia without iron overload, but also for true iron overload.
