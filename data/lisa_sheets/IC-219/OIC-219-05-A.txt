Apart from the clinical signs linked to the cause, iron deficiency without anaemia can be responsible for asthenia, but it can also be asymptomatic and be discovered by chance.

The associated anaemia may be well tolerated if it is chronic, but the repercussions may be more serious: asthenia, exertional dyspnoea, tachycardia.


In the event of prolonged martial deficiency, mucous membrane damage may occur:

- Phanera: koilonychia (cracked, brittle, concave nails), moderate diffuse alopecia

- Oral cavity: glossitis
