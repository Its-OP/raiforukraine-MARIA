If iron overload is confirmed by the presence of ''hyperferritinaemia'' '''and''' a '''transferrin saturation coefficient greater than 45%''', '''the 1st<sup>er</sup> examination to be performed''' is '''research into the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene''' (with signed consent from the patient).

In the case of C282Y homozygosity, the diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis is confirmed.
Further investigations to check for complications depend on the presence of clinical signs, ferritin levels and transferrin saturation coefficient.
The different clinical stages of haemochromatosis are shown in Table 3.

- If the diagnosis is made as part of genetic counselling screening, with a blood ferritin level and transferrin saturation coefficient < 45%, there is no need to carry out any additional tests to check for complications at diagnosis (stage 0). This is also not necessary in the absence of symptoms, with a transferrin saturation coefficient above 45% but still normal ferritin levels (stage 1).

- In the event of a transferrin saturation coefficient greater than 45% and hyperferritinaemia, whether or not associated with clinical signs (stages 2 to 4), a work-up to look for organ complications should be carried out, including a liver MRI with measurement of intrahepatic iron concentration.

Liver biopsy is not useful for diagnosing genetic haemochromatosis, and non-invasive markers can be used to quantify fibrosis if there is a suspicion. Liver biopsy may be performed if cirrhosis is suspected.

In the absence of C282Y homozygosity, hepatic MRI without injection is proposed in the absence of contraindication to quantify intra-hepatic iron and orientate the diagnosis. Hepatic biopsy (with Pearls staining), on the other hand, is virtually no longer indicated now that it is possible to quantify iron using MRI.
