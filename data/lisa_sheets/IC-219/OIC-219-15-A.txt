The investigation strategy will be defined according to the questioning and clinical signs, but also according to the patient's age and sex.


- ''In elderly subjects (or at least after the age of 40) if there is no clinical indication''.

Exploration in this age group is essentially based on upper and lower digestive endoscopy.


- ''In young patients and non-menopausal women with no clinical indication''.

In this population, the risk of colorectal cancer is low, and it is therefore possible to limit the first-line treatment to an upper digestive endoscopy after ruling out a gynaecological cause in women.


If upper GI endoscopy is performed, duodenal and gastric biopsies should be taken systematically to check for celiac disease, Biermer's disease and/or Helicobacter pylori infection.
