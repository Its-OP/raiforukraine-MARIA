* nutritional deficiencies: duration of breastfeeding, insufficient consumption of infant formula, aberrant diet, etc;
* neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD, depression, difficulties at school);
* eating disorders (pica);
* heavy menstrual periods in adolescents
* transit disorders suggestive of malabsorption (malnutrition, weight loss) or inflammatory disease of the digestive tract in older children (perianal abscesses, mouth ulcers).

Depending on the aetiological orientation, the complementary examinations to be carried out will be

* CRP (IBD, chronic inflammatory disease)
* faecal calprotectin (IBD)
* anti-transglutaminase IgA assay (coeliac disease)
* vitamin assessment to look for other deficiencies (malabsorption)
* oeso-gastro-duodenal endoscopy (EOGD) / colonoscopy (on specialist advice)
