The most common primary intracranial tumours were described in the previous section. Other rarer histological subtypes exist:


- '''Neurinoma or schwannoma''' :

o Development from Schwann cells of the cranial/peripheral nerves (with the exception of the olfactory nerve and the optic nerve, which are extensions of the central nervous system).

o Benin in the vast majority of cases

o Sporadic or as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (phacomatosis)

o preferential location = vestibular nerve +++

o MRI: homogeneously enhanced tumour arising from the internal auditory canal (for vestibular schwannoma)


- '''Ependymoma:'''

o Development from ventricular ependymocytes

o Intraventricular location, often supraventricular in adults (unlike children)

o Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults

o MRI: poly-lobulated morphology; intense enhancement after contrast injection

o Benign (WHO grade 1 or 2); more rarely malignant (WHO grade 3)

- '''Medulloblastoma:'''

o Malignant embryonal tumour (WHO grade 4)

o Infra tentorial location = vermis of the cerebellum +++.

o Occurs mainly in children, sometimes in young adults.

o MRI: heterogeneous enhancement after contrast injection

o Possible metastatic dissemination in the LCS → systematically injected panmedullary MRI +++.


- '''Hemangioblastoma:'''

o Benign vascular tumour

o Sporadic or as part of Von Hippel-Lindau disease (phacomatosis)

o Preferential location in the cerebellum +++, or spinal cord

o MRI: mixed appearance, i.e. cystic/solid, with a strongly enhanced mural nodule after contrast injection

o Biology: rarely (but very suggestive of the diagnosis), presence of secondary polycythaemia (secretion of erythropoietic factor by the tumour).


- '''Primary cerebral lymphoma:'''

o [[Malignant lymphoma|Lymphoma]] type B, diffuse, large cell

o Primitive = in the absence of any other systemic location

o Rare

o > 60 years

o Terrain: occurrence favoured by immunosuppression e.g. [[HIV: Know the elements of prevention through screening|HIV]], organ transplantation

o MRI: tumour frequently multifocal; periventricular location; "flaky" appearance, evenly enhanced after contrast injection
