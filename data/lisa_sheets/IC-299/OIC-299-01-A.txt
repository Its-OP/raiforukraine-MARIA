- Primary tumour: arising from intracranial tissue

- Secondary tumour = metastasis: resulting from intracranial dissemination of a tumour originating in another organ/system.


- Intra-parenchymal tumour: developed within the brain itself

- Extra-parenchymal tumour: developed from the appendages of the brain, i.e. the meninges and cranial nerves.

 



 

- Benign'' tumour: generally well circumscribed, slow-growing and with a good prognosis (e.g. meningioma).

- Malignant tumour = cancer: rapidly progressive and with a poorer prognosis (e.g. glioblastoma)

==Topography:==

*Supra tentorial = "above the cerebellum tentum" (about 80% of cases in adults)
*'''Infra tentorial =''''below the cerebellum tentum'' (about 20% of cases in adults)
*The distribution of the different histological types is not homogeneous within these two groups +++.

==Most frequent histological varieties, in descending order:==

*Metastases
*Gliomas (8 new cases/100,000 population/year)
*Meningiomas (5 new cases / 100,000 inhabitants / year)
*Pituitary adenomas (5 new cases/100,000 population/year)
