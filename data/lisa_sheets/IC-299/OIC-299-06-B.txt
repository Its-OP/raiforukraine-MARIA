'''In emergency: brain scan without and with injection +++'''

- Easy access

- Enables positive and differential diagnosis (e.g. intracerebral haematoma)

'''Etiological diagnosis and treatment planning:''' '''MRI +++''''

- Tumour characteristics: number; volume; circumscribed or diffuse morphology; intra or extra parenchymal location; topography (supra or infra tentorial, ventricles, cerebellum, trunk, etc.); nature of contrast (absent, intense, homogeneous, heterogeneous).

- Consequences of the tumour: mass effect, oedema, hydrocephalus, commitment, etc.

- Possibility of acquiring multimodal images, providing additional non-morphological information:

o Diffusion sequence: abscess = hypersignal diffusion with restriction of the apparent diffusion coefficient; tumour = hyposignal diffusion without restriction of the apparent diffusion coefficient (as the pus is thick, the water molecules are not very mobile and do not diffuse).

o Perfusion sequence: hyperperfusion in malignant tumours

o Spectroscopy: metabolites suggestive of abscess or malignant tumour

o Functional: localisation of functionally eloquent cortexes (language, motor skills) for preoperative mapping purposes

- An aetiological hypothesis can often be formulated on the basis of these MRI findings, but no feature is absolutely pathognomonic, and only anatomopathological examination can ultimately provide a histological diagnosis of "certainty".
