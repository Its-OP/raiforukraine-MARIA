'''Meningioma:'''

- Often benign, WHO grade 1

- Development from arachnoid cells

- Sex ratio: predominantly female

- Peak incidence: between 50 and 70 years of age

- Genesis favoured by the use of certain progestogens (cyproterone acetate)

- Possibility of multiple localisations (meningiomatosis), in association with other histological varieties of tumours of the nervous system (e.g. schwannomas) as part of neurofibromatosis type 2 (phacomatosis).

- MRI semiology: extra-parenchymal tumour; well circumscribed; base of dural implantation; dural thickening on contact = "comet tail" sign; homogeneous enhancement after injection of contrast (gadolinium).

- Treatment essentially surgical in symptomatic forms or those showing radiological progression


'''[[Pituitary adenoma]]:''''

- Secreting (prolactinoma, GH, LH, FSH, ACTH or TSH adenoma) or non-secreting

- Clinical signs :

o Endocrine syndrome: hypersecretion of a hormonal sector; insufficiency of one or more hormonal sectors, anterior and/or posterior to the pituitary gland(s).

o Mass syndrome, e.g. with compression of the optic chiasm (bitemporal hemianopia)

o Pituitary apoplexy (rarer)

- First-line surgical treatment, except for prolactinoma = dopaminergic agonists. Correction of endocrine deficits +++.


'''Low-grade and high-grade glioma (glioblastoma) of malignancy:''''

- Development from glia cells :

o Astrocyte → astrocytoma

o Oligodendrocyte → oligodendroglioma

- 4 grades according to the WHO classification :

o Grade 1 = benign

o Grade 2 = low grade malignancy (inevitable progression to grade 3 and 4)

o Grade 3 and 4 = high grade of malignancy

- → 2 subtypes of glioblastoma:

o Primary ''(de novo)'''

o Secondary = transformation of a low-grade glioma as it progresses; younger subjects

- For glioblastoma (grade 4), the factors that improve prognosis are :

o Age < 70

o General and neurological condition preserved (Karnofsky index > 70%)

o Quality of surgical resection

Molecular biology: IDH mutation (= secondary glioblastoma); MGMT gene promoter methylation, predicts sensitivity to chemotherapy.

Gliomas

'''LOW GRADE'''
|Grade 1
|< 20 years
<br />
|Infra tentorial
|Mixed = cystic / solid

Enhancement after contrast
|Surgery
|Healing if complete resection
|-
|Grade 2
|20-40 years
<br />
|Super tentorial
|T2 hypersignal T1 hyposignal No contrast enhancement
|Surgery (maximal resection, if possible)

+/- radiotherapy / chemotherapy
<br />
|Unstoppable progression to anaplasia (grades 3 and 4)

| rowspan="2" |






'''Gliomas''' '''HIGH GRADE''''
|Grade 3
|30-50 years
|Supra tentorial
|Hypersignal T2 Hyposignal T1

Taking of contrast
|Surgery (maximal resection, if possible)

+ radiotherapy / chemotherapy
|Unstoppable progression to glioblastoma (grade 4)
|-
|Grade 4
|Age 60-70
|Super tentorial
|Necrosis

Heterogeneous contrast
|Surgery (maximal resection, if possible)

+ concomitant radio-chemotherapy (Stupp protocol)
|Rapid local/regional spread

Overall survival of 15 months

'''Metastasis:'''

- Main origins = cancers with a strong neurological tropism: bronchopulmonary, breast and melanoma

- MRI: single or multiple tumour(s); cortico-subcortical location; heterogeneous enhancement after contrast injection, with cocardial appearance (central necrosis and peripheral contrast); peritumoral oedema +++; haemorrhagic revelation of melanoma and kidney cancer metastases.

- Treatment :

o Depends on the number, location and volume of the metastasis(es) and the existence of neurological deficits.

o Arsenal = excisional surgery; focal (conformal or stereotactic) or pan-brain radiotherapy; systemic treatments (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapies).
