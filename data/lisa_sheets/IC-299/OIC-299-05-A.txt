'''1 / Intracranial hypertension syndrome (HTIC)''' :

- Consequence of the increase in one or more volumes in a closed inextensible enclosure, i.e. the skull: tumour +/- peri-tumoral vasogenic oedema +/- hydrocephalus (obstacle to the free circulation of the CSF) +/- intra-tumoral bleeding.

- Symptoms :

o '''Headache''' :

- No location value

- Unusual

- Gradual worsening

- Poorly soothed by the usual painkillers

- Recurrence at the end of the night or in the morning, and during exertion with the glottis closed

- Relieved by vomiting

o '''Nausea and [[Vomiting in infants, children and adults|vomiting]] "jet"'''''

o '''Paresis of the abducens nerve (VI):''''

- No locating value +++

- Convergent squint

- Horizontal [[Diplopia]]

- (VI = long, thin nerve, particularly susceptible to increased intracranial pressure)

o '''Decreased visual acuity:''''

- Optic nerve damage caused by HTIC

- Can lead to blindness

- Fundus (FO) = bilateral papilledema due to stasis

- Complications :

o '''Psychic slowing down, vigilance disorders'''

- from drowsiness to coma (Glasgow score +++)

o '''Cerebral involvement leading to death'''


'''2/'''' '''Focal neurological deficits:''''

o Location function, e.g. :

- Occipital lobe = homonymous lateral hemianopia

- Frontal lobe = contralateral hemiparesis

- Temporal lobe of dominant hemisphere for language = aphasia

o Gradual onset, with worsening in an "oil stain" pattern

o More frequent in rapidly progressive tumours

'''[[Childhood and adult epilepsy|3 / Epilepsy]] :''''

o Focal/partial seizures with a localising value +++, or immediately generalised seizures

o More frequent in tumours with cortical contact and slow evolution (low-grade glioma, meningioma)


'''4/'''' '''Endocrine disorders:''''

o In the case of a tumour of the sellar region, e.g. [[pituitary adenoma]] or craniopharyngioma

o Hypersecretion, e.g. Cushing's syndrome, acromegaly, hyper prolactinaemia with amenorrhoea/galactorrhoea

o Anterior and/or posterior pituitary insufficiency: one or more hormonal sectors, e.g. hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus.
