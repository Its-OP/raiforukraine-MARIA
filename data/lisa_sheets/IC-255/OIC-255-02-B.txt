'''In the short term'''

Maternal complications

Pregnancy-induced arterial hypertension ('''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|hypertension during pregnancy]]'''), pre-eclampsia ('''[[Proteinuria SD-212|proteinuria]]''')

Caesarean section

These complications are correlated with the degree of initial hyperglycaemia. The risk increases if the mother is overweight or obese.

Fetal complications

Macrosomia (shoulder dystocia)

Neonatal hypoglycaemia

Malformations (increased risk if type 2 diabetes unrecognised)
