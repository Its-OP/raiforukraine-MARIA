Phase of physiological insulin resistance in the second half of pregnancy linked to :

           Placental hormones

           Maternal hormones (cortisol, leptin, growth hormone)

In a physiological situation = reactive hyperinsulinism enabling euglycaemia to be maintained

In the event of impaired pancreatic function leading to the appearance of ''[[Hyperglycaemia SD-208|hyperglycaemia]]'' and therefore gestational diabetes
