In the case of GDM balanced by diet and in the absence of any other associated pathology or risk factor, the monitoring procedures will be those of a normal pregnancy [[Normal pregnancy monitoring consultation (17, 2nd and 3rd trimester) SD-268|('''Normal pregnancy monitoring consultation - 1<sup>er</sup>, 2<sup>ème</sup> and 3<sup>ème</sup> trimester''']]). The presence of additional risk factors (high maternal age, obesity, poor glycaemic control, history of chronic hypertension) may justify more frequent monitoring (blood pressure, search for ''[[Proteinuria SD-212|proteinuria]]''') than monthly antenatal monitoring, due to the increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Monthly ultrasound monitoring may be suggested for diabetics who are poorly controlled or on insulin.


At the end of pregnancy:

In the case of GDM that is well controlled by diet alone or insulin, and without foetal macrosomia, there is no reason to induce before term (41 SA).

In cases of poorly balanced gestational diabetes or with foetal repercussions (especially macrosomia), labour can be induced at 39 weeks' gestation.
