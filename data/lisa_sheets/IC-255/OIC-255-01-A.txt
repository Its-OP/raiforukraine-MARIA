'''Gestational diabetes''' = carbohydrate tolerance disorder of variable severity, beginning or first diagnosed during pregnancy, irrespective of treatment and course in the post-partum period. Differs from pre-pregnancy diabetes in that it does not pre-exist pregnancy. The difference is difficult to make if there is no history of blood glucose levels prior to pregnancy, as type 2 diabetes in particular is often asymptomatic.

The level of ''[[Hyperglycaemia SD-208|hyperglycaemia]]''' at discovery is a diagnostic element (see table).

'''[[Screening for Gestational Diabetes SD-304|Screening for Gestational Diabetes in Pregnant Women]]''':

Selective screening on ≥ 1 of these criteria:

Age ≥ 35 years

BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2

1st degree family history of diabetes

History of gestational diabetes

History of a macrosomic child


Screening procedures as part of a ''[[Normal pregnancy follow-up consultation (17, 2nd and 3rd trimester) SD-268|Normal pregnancy follow-up consultation (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester)]]''''

In early pregnancy, a fasting blood glucose test

Between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation with an oral dose of 75g of glucose
