The obstetric and paediatric team's knowledge of the maternal history, the course of the pregnancy and the term of birth enables them to identify, before birth, groups of children at risk of presenting difficulties in adapting to life outside the womb and/or neonatal or longer-term complications.

Only the main risk factors and neonatal complications are listed in this chapter; refer to item 30 for a detailed description of the pathophysiology and preventive measures.


'''Prematurity'''

'''Definition:'''

Prematurity is defined as birth before 37 weeks' amenorrhoea (SA) and, from 22 SA, of a child weighing at least 500g.

'''Main risk factors:'''

* Maternal background :
** Single, low socio-economic level ('''Precarious social situation and isolation)'', smoking ('''Prevention of tobacco-related risks'''), alcohol consumption, drug addiction, stress, '''anxiety''', depression, prolonged standing, inconsistent follow-up ;
** History of premature delivery and late miscarriage, uterine malformation (''Discovery of a malformation of the genital tract''), fibroids (''Pelvic mass''), in utero exposure to Distilbene®, short interval between last two pregnancies, conisation, cervico-isthmic incompetence, bacterial vaginosis, IVF (''Difficulty procreating'');
** Chronic maternal pathologies (heart disease, nephropathy, etc.), neoplasia, etc;
* Multiple pregnancies;
* Complications of pregnancy : hypertensive pathologies including pre-eclampsia ('''Hypertension during pregnancy and Proteinuria'''), retroplacental haematoma, metrorrhagia ('''[[Genital bleeding during pregnancy SD-111|Genital bleeding]] during pregnancy, acute haemorrhage'''), intrauterine growth retardation, uterine contractions (''Uterine contraction in a pregnant woman, Pelvic pain''), premature rupture of membranes ('''[[Loss of fluid in a preterm pregnant woman SD-109|Loss of fluid]] in a preterm pregnant woman'''), placental anomalies (placenta previa, ....), hydramnios (uterine distension), amniochorionic infection.

'''Possible complications in children:'''

- Deaths ;

- Hypothermia

- Neonatal bacterial infection ;

- Anemia ;

- Metabolic: ''[[Hypoglycaemia SD-209|hypoglycaemia]]''', hypocalcaemia, ''[[Icterus SD-047|icterus]]''';

- Neurological: intraventricular haemorrhages, periventricular leukomalacia;

- Respiratory: hyaline membrane disease, apnoea, bronchopulmonary dysplasia;

- Hemodynamics: persistence of the ductus arteriosus ;

- Digestive: enteropathy/ulcerative necrotising enterocolitis, feeding difficulties;

- Ophthalmological: retinopathy of prematurity ;

Longer term: neurodevelopment disorders (motor, cognitive), sensory anomalies, etc.


'''Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)'''

'''Definitions:'''

Small for Gestational Age (SGA) is defined as an isolated weight (estimated in utero weight or birth weight) below the 10th percentile. Severe PAG corresponds to a PAG below the 3rd percentile.

IUGR (Fetal Growth Restriction - FGR - or Intra-Uterine Growth Retardation - IUGR) most often corresponds to a PAG associated with arguments in favour of a pathological growth defect (abnormality of the staturo-ponderal [[normal growth of the child 2C-053-DE-A01|growth]]): stoppage or inflection of growth longitudinally (at least 2 measurements 3 weeks apart).

'''Main risk factors:''''

''-'' Maternal background / obstetrical history '':'' age < 20 years or > 35 years, '''Malnutrition/Denutrition''', low socio-economic level ('''precarious social situation and isolation''), smoking ('''prevention of tobacco-related risks''), alcoholism, drug addiction, uterine malformations, multiple or large fibroids (''Discovery of a pelvic anomaly on medical imaging''), history of pregnancy complicated by IUGR, low weight gain during pregnancy, placental haemangioma, velamentous cord insertion;

''-'' Foetal pathologies: chromosomal anomaly, malformative syndrome, foetal infection (especially CMV). These IUGRs are early (onset in the 2nd trimester) and severe (BP < 3rd percentile), and often associated with morphological anomalies or hydramnios (increased amniotic fluid);

''-'' Vascular pathologies '':'' preeclampsia ('''[[Arterial hypertension SD-042|Arterial hypertension]]''' and/or '''[[Hypertension during pregnancy SD-053|Hypertension during pregnancy]]''' and '''[[Proteinuria SD-212|Proteinuria]]'''), chronic maternal pathologies : '''Chronic arterial hypertension''', nephropathy ('''increased creatinine'''), lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, diabetes with vascular complications ('''prevention of cardiovascular disease'''). IUGR of vascular origin is most often late (onset in the 3rd trimester), but can be early in severe forms. These IUGRs tend to recur in subsequent pregnancies.

'''Possible complications in children:'''

- Perinatal asphyxia ;

- Hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia;

- Polycythaemia secondary to chronic foetal hypoxia ;

- In the case of associated prematurity, increased mortality and risk of respiratory and digestive complications;

Longer term :

- Neurodevelopmental abnormalities ;

- Growth retardation ;

- Metabolic syndrome in adults

'''Neonatal bacterial infections (NBI)'''

Refer to the 2017 good practice recommendations: Management of the newborn at risk of early bacterial neonatal infection (≥ 34 SA).

INBP risk factors

1) Maternal colonisation with SGB

2) History of neonatal GBS infection

3) Maternal fever > 38.0°C intrapartum or within 2 hours of delivery

4) Membrane rupture > 12h

5) Spontaneous and unexplained prematurity < 37 SA

6) Antibiotic prophylaxis or inadequate per-partum antibiotic therapy (recommended for situations 1 to 3 regardless of the result of the vaginal swab and in situations 4 and 5 in the case of a positive or unknown vaginal swab).

'''Identify newborns presenting symptoms of BIN'' (non-specific but should raise the possibility of BIN if present in the first 48 hours) '''([[Examination of the term newborn SD-039|Examination of the term newborn]])''' :

* General signs: fever (temperature ≥ 38.0°C) or hypothermia (temperature < 36.0°C) '''(Hyperthermia/[[Acute fever in children and adults|fever]], [[Hypothermia SD-045|Hypothermia]])''' ;
* Respiratory signs: respiratory distress (signs of struggle), tachypnoea (respiratory rate > 60/min), apnoea (acute respiratory distress);
* Haemodynamic signs: tachycardia (> 160 bpm) or bradycardia (< 80 bpm), signs of shock (increased skin recolouration time, pallor, arterial hypotension, oliguria) → signs of severity '''(Tachycardia, [[Child pallor SD-055|pallor]] of the child)'''' ;
* Neurological signs: somnolence, irritability, hypotonia, convulsions → signs of seriousness, must suggest neonatal meningitis '''(Coma and consciousness disorders, [[Hypotonia/infant malaise SD-046|Hypotonia]] / [[Malaise/loss of consciousness SD-050|malaise]] of the infant, [[Convulsions SD-120|Convulsions]])''' ;
* Digestive signs: refusal to drink, vomiting.


'''Complications''' '''possible in children''': variable depending on the bacteria responsible for INBP and the severity of the infection (septic shock, meningitis)

'''Respiratory distress'''

'''Main risk factors:''''

* Prematurity;
* Risk factors for early neonatal bacterial infection;
* Diabetes prior to pregnancy, gestational diabetes;
* Caesarean section before labour;
* Meconium amniotic fluid;
* Perinatal anoxo-ischaemia.

'''Clinical diagnosis''' '''([[Acute respiratory distress SD-160|Respiratory distress]] acute, [[Term newborn examination SD-039|Term newborn examination]])''': presence of one or more of the following symptoms:

- polypnoea: FR > 60/min ;

- signs of respiratory struggle: flapping of the wings of the nose, thoraco-abdominal rocking, intercostal draught, xyphoid funnel, expiratory whimpering ;

- cyanosis and/or low oxygen saturation '''(Colour abnormalities of the extremities)''''

'''Signs of seriousness''' :

- intensity of respiratory distress: Silverman score ;

- pauses in breathing ;

- associated haemodynamic disorders.

'''Complications''' '''possible in children''': mainly related to the cause of respiratory distress

'''Maternal pathologies: diabetes during pregnancy'''

'''Complications''' '''in children specific to type 1 or 2 diabetes prior to pregnancy:''''

* congenital malformations (especially of the central nervous system, heart and skeleton)

'''Complications in children common to all types of diabetes (type 1, type 2, gestational):''''

* foetal death in utero ;
* prematurity
* macrosomia and obstetric complications (shoulder dystocia, brachial plexus injury, fracture, perinatal asphyxia): mainly related to glycaemic imbalance in the 3rd<sup> trimester of pregnancy;
* metabolic: hypoglycaemia (due to hyperinsulinism), hypocalcaemia, polycythemia, jaundice;
* respiratory distress (in particular hyaline membrane disease) '''(Acute respiratory distress)''' ;
* hypertrophic cardiomyopathy possible.

Longer term :

* Metabolic risks: obesity, glucose intolerance, etc.
* Maternal pathologies: infections

Refer to item 27 Prevention of foetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation.

Main infections at risk for the foetus and/or the newborn:

* Bacterial: syphilis, listeriosis, bacteria responsible for INBP (mainly Streptococcus B, E. Coli);
* Viral: genital herpes, measles, rubella, chickenpox, cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B19, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV;
* Parasitic: Toxoplasmosis

'''Maternal pathologies: medical treatments'''

Refer to item 27 (Prevention of foetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation).

Drug treatments should be taken into account during the pre-conception interview, during pregnancy and/or during breastfeeding because of the potential teratogenic risks, foetal risks or neonatal risks.

These risks are specific to each drug and, depending on the case, may be contraindicated / not recommended / possible during all or part of pregnancy.

It can be discussed:

- adjusting dosage ;

- specific treatment in the event of foetal exposure;

- monitoring or care of the newborn baby

Maternal addictions (tobacco, alcohol, drugs)

Refer to item 27 (Prevention of foetal risks: infection, drugs, toxic substances, irradiation) for screening and management of maternal addictions.

'''Possible complications for the child of maternal smoking:''''

* During pregnancy: teratogenicity, spontaneous miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight/intrauterine growth retardation;
* In newborns, infants and children: unexpected infant death syndrome, lower respiratory infections (bronchiolitis), ENT infections (acute otitis media);
* In the longer term: overweight/obesity in particular, more frequent and earlier onset of smoking in adolescents whose parents are smokers.

'''Possible complications for the child of alcohol consumption by the mother:''' Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) / Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD)

* FAS: documented especially in cases of heavy consumption. Varying degrees of association with intrauterine growth retardation / facial dysmorphia (rounded forehead, thin upper lip, short philtrum, low, badly hemmed ears, etc.) / malformations (especially of the central nervous system) / more or less marked mental retardation and behavioural disorders.
* Acute consumption (of the "bingedrinking" type) is associated with an increased risk of cognitive problems in children.

'''Possible complications for the child of maternal drug addiction:''' variable depending on the product and the quantities consumed. Frequent poly-drug use.

- Opiates: mainly neonatal withdrawal syndrome (onset a few hours to a few days after birth, with varying degrees of neurological, digestive, respiratory and neurovegetative signs).

- Cocaine: foetal death in utero, spontaneous miscarriage, placenta previa, premature rupture of membranes, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation. Postnatal effects less well described.

- Cannabis: spontaneous miscarriage, placenta previa, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation. Frequent use of cannabis and tobacco together

It is important to detect such use, to offer the woman treatment and addictological follow-up with a view to weaning her off the drug or at least reducing her consumption, to monitor the newborn baby in the light of the risks mentioned above, and to assess the social and family situation and provide treatment on a case-by-case basis (precarious social situation and isolation, suspected abuse and children at risk).

Maternal psychiatric disorders

Refer to item 69 - Pregnancy and post-partum psychological disorders for psychological pathologies specific to pregnancy.

Whatever the mother's psychological pathology, the child's care is based on :

* Specific neonatal monitoring according to maternal treatments taken during pregnancy;
* Assessment of the family situation (state of health of both parents, family environment);
* Case-by-case care after the birth (support measures, parenting support, proposals for day-care facilities or mother-baby hospitalisation, drafting of a report of concern/reporting to the cellule de recueil des informations préoccupantes and possible separation of mother and child in the event of possible danger to the child). <br />
