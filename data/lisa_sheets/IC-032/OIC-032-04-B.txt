Neonatal blood screening is carried out systematically on blotting paper at around 72 hours of life (not before 48 hours). Clear and comprehensible information must be given to the parents, and written consent is recorded before the blood sample is taken ''([[Systematic neonatal screening SD-308|Neonatal screening]] systematic)''. Parents are only notified if there is an abnormal result requiring a follow-up test. This screening concerns 6 diseases:

* '''Phenylketonuria''''

* Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency → screening = increased phenylalanine dosage
* Neonatal warning signs: no
* Risk of psychomotor retardation in the absence of treatment (phenylalanine-controlled diet).

* '''Congenital hypothyroidism'''

* L-Thyroxine secretion deficiency due to thyroid dysgenesis (athyreosis, hypoplasia, ectopia) or hormonogenesis disorder (thyroid gland in place) → screening: elevation of TSH blood level
* Neonatal warning signs: prolonged jaundice, constipation, hypotonia, sucking difficulties, wide fontanelles, hypothermia, macroglossia ''(Hypotonia / [[Severe infant malaise and unexpected infant death|infant malaise]])'''  Risk of psychomotor retardation, osteodystrophy, growth retardation in the absence of treatment (thyroid hormone replacement).

* '''Congenital adrenal hyperplasia'''

* 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (>95% of cases), leading to cortisol and aldosterone deficiency and excess androgen production → screening: elevation of 17-OH-progesterone blood levels
* Neonatal call signs: salt loss syndrome with vomiting, dehydration and metabolic disorders (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) '''([[Childhood dehydration SD-032|Dehydration]] of the child)'''. In girls, virilisation of the external genitalia visible from birth (''Discovery of a malformation of the genital tract)''.
* Treatment: hydrocortisone replacement, fludrocortisone and sodium supplementation.

* Cystic fibrosis

* Mutations in the CFTR gene encoding a transmembrane protein regulating chloride ion transport → screening: increased immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) blood levels.
* Neonatal signs: meconium ileus, retentional cholestatic jaundice.

* '''Sickle cell disease'''

* Structural abnormality of the β chain of globin leading to the production of abnormal haemoglobin S → screening: haemoglobin electrophoresis (specific HbS band and absence of HbA band). Screening targeted at children whose parents are from high-prevalence countries: sub-Saharan Africa, West Indies, French Guiana, Réunion, Mediterranean basin.
* Neonatal signs: no

* MCAD deficiency

* Fatty acid β-oxidation abnormality → screening: measurement of octanoyl-carnitine (C8).
* Neonatal signs: hypoglycaemic hypoketotic malaise (fasting hypoglycaemia failure to utilise fatty acids) (''[[Hypoglycaemia SD-209|Hypoglycaemia]]'')''
