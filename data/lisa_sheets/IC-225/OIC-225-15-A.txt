==The emergency situations are:==

===Ruptured aneurysms===
These must be operated on as a matter of extreme urgency. The overall mortality rate is > 80%. Patients arriving at hospital alive most often have a rupture contained in the retroperitoneum. In this case, a CT scan may be performed if haemodynamics permit. Mortality after surgery for ruptured aneurysms is around 30%.

===Painful aneurysms===
Patients with painful aneurysms must be admitted to hospital rapidly for surgery. A CT scan is carried out as a matter of urgency, while at the same time the patient's general, cardiovascular, renal and respiratory condition is assessed.

===Acute lower limb ischaemia===
Acute ischaemia due to embolism from the aneurysm thrombus is a rare event. It requires immediate specific management by embolectomy. The aneurysm must be treated secondarily.

===Aorto-caval fistula or aorto-digestive fistula===
Aorto-caval and aorto-digestive fistulas correspond to the rupture of the aneurysm in a neighbouring hollow organ: the inferior vena cava or the duodenum. Aorto-caval fistulas cause haemodynamic failure without deglobulation. Acute aortodigestive fistula causes haemodynamic failure with digestive haemorrhage, which may manifest as haematemesis or rectal bleeding. Chronic aortodigestive fistula leads to sepsis of the prosthesis and microcytic anaemia due to occult bleeding. These are rare and serious situations, requiring emergency vascular surgery.
