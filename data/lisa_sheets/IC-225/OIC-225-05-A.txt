The medical management of AOMI aims to slow the progression of atheromatous disease by correcting the risk factors [[Management of forced smoking cessation SD-242|'''''in particular tobacco''''']] and instituting systematic drug treatment including:

- in '''symptomatic''' patients, a [[Prescription and monitoring of anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant treatment SD-248|'''''antiplaquettaire''''']] a [[Prescription of a lipid-lowering agent SD-252|'''''statin''''']] even in the absence of dyslipidaemia and a [[2C-330|'''''IEC''''']] even in the absence of hypertension is instituted.

- in a'''symptomatic'' patient, a [[Prescription of a lipid-lowering agent SD-252|'''''statin''''']] even in the absence of dyslipidaemia and a [[2C-330|'''''IEC''''']] even in the absence of hypertension. Treatment [[Prescription and monitoring of anticoagulant and/or anti-aggregant therapy SD-248|a'''''ntiplaquettaire''''']] is discussed according to the patient's overall cardiovascular risk.

===In case of claudication:===

*Walking training should be introduced after assessment of coronary exercise tolerance, based on [[Therapeutic modification of lifestyle (sleep, physical activity, diet, etc.) SD-324|''''' a personalised programme including regular assessment''''']]. It can be practised by self-training at home or optimised by treatment in a specialised centre with a [[Prescription of rehabilitation SD-247|'''''supervised rehabilitation''''']] and [[Follow-up consultation and therapeutic education for a patient with a cardiovascular antecedent SD-285|'''''structured therapeutic education programme''''']] programme. It allows collaterals to be developed and walking distance to be increased.
*Surgical revascularisation improves perfusion in the affected area. Sometimes, without aiming for complete revascularisation, it aims to treat the most significant lesion. It may be performed using endoluminal techniques''''' (angioplasty with or without a stent) or open surgery (endarterectomy or bypass for proximal lesions).
**in the event of persistent disabling claudication despite optimal medical management for 6 months and control of atheromatous risk factors.
**It may be discussed from the outset or at an earlier stage in the case of lesions that pose a threat due to their location or haemodynamic impact.

'''''Regular monitoring ensures'''''

*[[Assessment of therapeutic compliance SDD-354|adherence to proposed therapeutic lifestyle modifications,]] walking rehabilitation and drug prescriptions;
*achievement of therapeutic targets :
**LDL cholesterol below 1.4 mmol/L (0.55 g/L) AND 50% reduction from baseline.
**blood pressure below 120/70 mmHg if well tolerated. In elderly or frail patients, higher blood pressure levels may be tolerated.
**glycaemic control
**smoking cessation;
*tolerance of treatment; effectiveness of management;
*patency of revascularisation.

===In case of symptoms at rest===
The immediate therapeutic objective is limb salvage, in the event of symptoms at rest.

*Revascularisation is essential whenever possible, and must be as complete as possible given the high risk of amputation.
*If ischaemia persists despite revascularisation, amputation becomes necessary.
*Amputation from the outset remains a therapeutic option if revascularisation is not possible or if the local situation is life-threatening, in particular extensive necrosis or infection.
*Complementary medical treatment aims to combat aggravating factors such as pain, infection and malnutrition. Treatment for OAMI is continued or introduced.
*In the case of trophic disorders, multidisciplinary management is preferred.
