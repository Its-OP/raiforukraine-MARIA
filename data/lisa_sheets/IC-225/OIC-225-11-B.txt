AAAs are frequently associated with atherosclerosis (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, arteries of the lower limbs, renal and digestive arteries). The existence of familial forms leads us to suspect a genetic component in some cases. Vascular prostheses can be complicated by false anastomotic aneurysms.

In rare cases, this may be due to: an infectious aneurysm, the aneurysmal evolution of an aortic dissection, hereditary connective tissue dystrophies (Marfan's disease, vascular Ehlers Danlos disease, Loeys Dietz syndrome), inflammatory aortitis (Takayasu's disease, Horton's disease and Beh√ßet's disease).

AAA must be detected by ultrasound of the abdominal aorta (''discovery of an abdominal anomaly on medical imaging''). This screening is recommended for patients at risk, who are :

*All arteriopaths;
*Men aged 60 to 85;
*Women aged 60 to 85 (hypertensive or smokers);
*Men and women over 50 with a family history of aortic aneurysm in first-degree relatives.
