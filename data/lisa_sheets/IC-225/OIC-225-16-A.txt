==IV) Intestinal ischaemia== (in French)

*Digestive ischaemia corresponds to an "arterial perfusion insufficiency" linked to a "chronic" obstacle (most often of atheromatous origin) or an "acute" obstacle (by embolism, in situ thrombosis or dissection) of the digestive arteries. ('''''[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]; [[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]''''').
*There are 3 digestive arteries: the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery. The three territories are linked by anastomotic circulation. The superior mesenteric artery is the main artery of the digestive tract.

*Chronic intestinal ischaemia. Digestive blood flow depends on the metabolic needs of the digestive tract and represents between 20 and 35% of the body's total oxygen consumption. When metabolic demand increases in the post-prandial period, splanchnic blood flow is increased. Hyperaemia is maximal in the hour following the arrival of ingested food. It lasts around 5 hours. In the event of arterial obstruction, the relative post-prandial hypoperfusion explains the ischaemia responsible for the pain. The intensity and duration of symptoms are proportional to the volume and composition of the food ingested and the degree of hypoperfusion. ('''''[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain]]; [[Chronic pain SD-035|Chronic pain]]''''').

*[[Fichier:Infarctus mesenterique.jpg|vignette]]Acute intestinal ischaemia: in the event of acute arterial occlusion or low flow, intestinal ischaemia occurs. The consequences of this ischaemia may be reversible in the first few hours if arterial flow is restored, but if the ischaemia becomes permanent it leads to a mesenteric infarction ('''''[[Abdominal pain SD-004|Abdominal pain)]]'''''
