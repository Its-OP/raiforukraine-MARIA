===Suggestive circumstances===
AOMI may be asymptomatic. It should be suspected by the discovery of a ''[[Discovery of a vascular murmur SD-019|''vascular murmur'']]''' or by the abolition of peripheral pulses in a subject with cardiovascular risk factors.

Symptomatic AOMI manifests itself either as [[Intermittent limb claudication SD-069|'''''muscular pain on walking''''']] forcing the patient to stop walking (claudication), or by [[Chronic pain SD-035|'''''permanent pain''''']] of a [[Pain in a limb (upper or lower) SD-071|'''''limb''''']] or by a '''''[[Skin ulcer SD-092|trophic disorder]]''''' associated or not (symptoms at rest).

Sexual dysfunction and erectile dysfunction SD-063|'''''dysfonction érectile''''']], in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors, should be investigated for OSA.

===Diagnosis===
A clinical and haemodynamic classification is used. It is based on the search for symptoms and the measurement of perfusion pressures: systolic ankle pressure index (SAPI = ratio of ankle pressure to brachial pressure), ankle pressure and big toe pressure.

A distinction is made between :

*asymptomatic patients (SPI ≤ 0.90)
*claudication: exertional ischaemia stage (SPI ≤ 0.90)
*symptoms at rest: permanent ischaemia stage (ankle pressure < 50 mmHg or big toe pressure < 30 mmHg).

In the case of diabetes or chronic renal failure, the GPI and ankle pressure are most often inaccurate, as a result of arterial stiffness (calcification of the arterial wall). Diagnosis is then based on measurement of pressure at the big toe (digital pressure). In addition, any finding of an SPI >1.4 should systematically lead to a measurement of toe pressure. The diagnosis of AOMI is accepted in the event of toe pressure < 0.7

The functional classification of Leriche and Fontaine is no longer used.

===Differential diagnoses===
The main differential diagnoses of claudication and their characteristics are detailed in the table below:
