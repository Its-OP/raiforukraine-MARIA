==Aneurysm of the abdominal aorta===
An arterial aneurysm is a focal and permanent dilatation of the artery with a loss of parallelism of its walls, and whose diameter is greater than 1.5 times the upstream diameter.

The most common location is the abdominal aorta. The most common peripheral aneurysms are in the popliteal arteries.

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) develop preferentially in the sub-renal segment. It may be confined exclusively to the sub-renal aorta or extend to the iliac arteries.

=== '''Epidemiology''' ===
The main risk factors are smoking, advanced age, male sex and a family history of AAA.

AAA is often associated with atheromatous lesions in other arterial territories (coronary arteries, carotid arteries, visceral arteries, arteries of the lower limbs).

The prevalence of AAA is 5% in men aged over 65. The prevalence in women is not well known and is lower than in men.

=== '''Natural history''' ===
The diameter of the AAA increases over time. In the same patient, the rate of growth is not linear and there are variations from one patient to another. The greater the aortic diameter, the faster the rate of growth. An AAA is said to be "fast-growing" if it increases by more than 1 cm per year.

The risk of AAA developing is rupture, and this risk increases with the diameter. It is low for a diameter of less than 40 mm, and high above 55 mm.

For the same diameter, the risk of rupture is greater in women.

=== '''Other aneurysmal locations''' ===

==== Popliteal artery aneurysms ====
AAA can be associated with aneurysms in other locations, but most often in the popliteal arteries.

Aneurysms of the popliteal arteries almost exclusively affect men and are often bilateral (50% of cases).

A popliteal artery aneurysm is either asymptomatic, discovered during the clinical examination (popliteal pulses too well perceived) or during ultrasound exploration (for example during the assessment of an AAA). It may also be discovered in the setting of acute ischaemia, critical ischaemia or, more rarely, stress ischaemia.

The main risk is lower limb ischaemia (acute ischaemia or critical ischaemia), due to iterative low-noise emboli obstructing the downstream arterial network, or thrombosis of the aneurysm, the two mechanisms often being associated. The risk of lower-limb amputation following popliteal aneurysm thrombosis is high.

Rarely, popliteal artery aneurysms cause local compression (veins, nerves). Venous compression may be responsible for popliteal and sub-popliteal venous thrombosis.

Rupture is exceptional and should raise suspicion of an infectious origin.

==== Aneurysms of the iliac or femoral arteries ====
More rarely, other locations associated with AAA involve the femoral, common iliac or internal iliac arteries. They are systematically investigated by ultrasound or CT angiography.

==== Thoracic aortic aneurysms ====
AAA may be associated with a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT angiography is recommended to assess the extent of aneurysmal disease.
