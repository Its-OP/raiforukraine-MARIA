Coronary, cerebrovascular and mesenteric complications determine the patient's vital prognosis.

The functional prognosis is linked to the chronic, low-noise evolution of occlusive vascular lesions in the absence of medical treatment. These lead to an increase in ischaemia, the appearance of permanent critical ischaemia and trophic disorders. If the diagnosis is made too late, it may be impossible to revascularise the lower limb and amputations may be necessary.

==II) Acute limb ischaemia==)
Acute limb ischaemia can also be very sudden, with the onset of [[Limb pain (upper or lower) SD-071|'''''intense pain''''']].

It is a medico-surgical emergency: it is a medico-surgical therapeutic emergency because it threatens the patient's vital prognosis and/or the functional prognosis of the limb.

It requires rapid treatment in a specialised facility.

Despite appropriate treatment, the overall prognosis remains poor. Acute ischaemia is associated with 10% of deaths, 25% of amputations, 15% of sequelae and only 50% of good results.
