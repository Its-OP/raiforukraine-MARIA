In the case of a severe acute ankle sprain, an emergency X-ray should not be carried out (Ottawa criteria).

In the case of a severe chronic ankle sprain, frontal weight-bearing X-rays may reveal arthritic changes in the tibio-talar joint (Figure 1). Forced varus radiographs (figure 2) may show an opening of the joint space, indicating lateral instability.
