'''Search for subacromial-deltoid impingement:'''

- NEER: pain felt during passive anterior elevation associated with pressure on the acromion is a sign of anterosuperior impingement<gallery>

</gallery>- YOCUM: pain felt during active elevation against resistance, limb adducted signs anteromedial impingement<gallery>
File:361 4.png|YOCUM test (Conflict)
</gallery>- HAWKINS: does pain felt during passive internal rotation with limb in anterolateral elevation sign anteromedial impingement<gallery>

</gallery>'''Looking for a supraspinatus rupture:'''

           - JOBE: antero-lateral elevation at 30Â° of antepulsion against resistance, arm in internal rotation (thumb down). The test is positive if the patient cannot resist the examiner's lowering force. <gallery>

''' '''- PATTE: testing of strength against resistance in RE2 (External rotation in abduction)<gallery>

</gallery>'''Looking for subscapularis rupture:'''

''' '''- GERBER's Lift off test: This test is carried out actively and passively. In active mode, it looks for an inability to lift off the hand placed at the lumbosacral junction. In passive, it looks for an inability to keep the hand passively unstuck by the examiner. <gallery>

           - Palm up Test (GILCREEST) : This test looks for pain opposite the bicipital groove during opposing anterolateral supination elevation. <gallery>
