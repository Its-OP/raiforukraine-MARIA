'''Before reduction:'''

An imaging examination will be systematically requested before any attempt at reduction.

It should include a ''LAMY + GARTH'' frontal and lateral view (requiring no painful mobilisation for the patient).

It confirms the diagnosis and classifies the dislocation according to the position of the humeral head (extra, sub or intracoracoid).

It can also be used to look for an "associated fracture line" (humeral neck, major tubercle or glenoid).


'''After reduction:'''

An imaging examination will be systematically requested after reduction.

It should include a frontal view and a LAMY + GARTH profile view (requiring no painful mobilisation for the patient).

It allows you to "check the reduction".

It can be used to ''detect a bone lesion that is more easily visible after reduction'' (humeral notch, inferior glenoid fracture, fracture of the major tubercle).

A CT scan may be required to explore these associated bone lesions.
