'''<u>Quadricipital tendinopathy:</u>'''

* Quadricipital tendinopathy: in athletes, anterolateral patella pain triggered by tensioning of the quadriceps.
* Rupture of the quadricipital tendon: sudden onset, active extension deficit, persistence of passive extension, loss of tendon substance in the quadricipital tendon and haematoma.

'''<u>Patellar tendinopathy:</u>'''

* Patellar tendinopathy: in sportsmen and women, sports involving jumping (basketball, volleyball), anterior knee pain and tenderness in the lower part of the patella. Pain absent at rest, triggered by exertion.
* Rupture of the patellar tendon: active extension deficit, persistence of passive extension, ascension of the patella clinically and on X-ray of the knee in profile, loss of tendon substance in the patellar tendon and haematoma.

'''<u>Crowsfoot tendinopathy:</u>''' in sportsmen practising impulse sports (tennis, high jump, football and dance) and in women from the age of 50, medial and posterior pain, which may radiate down the leg, during exercise but sometimes at rest. Palpation of painful crow's feet.

'''<u>Tendinopathy of the tensor fascia lata:</u>''' iliotibial band syndrome, also known as windscreen wiper syndrome is related to friction of the fascia lata against the lateral epicondyle during flexion-extension movements causing painful irritation. Pain on the outside of the knee, sometimes radiating along the outside of the thigh, occurring with effort and progressively setting in. Renne test: pain in flexion-extension of the knee when weight-bearing on one foot. Noble's test: precise pain when pressure is applied to the lateral epicondyle.

'''<u>Prerotal bursitis:</u>''' painful prerotal swelling spontaneous or following trauma, absence of underlying knee joint effusion.
