Bursitis is very often inflammatory and aseptic, but can sometimes be septic:

Clinical signs of septic bursitis :

* Acute onset, often leading to a wound close to or on the limb (hand, foot).
* Locally: redness, heat, pain
* Sometimes fever and lymphadenopathy, rarely purulent discharge.

Biology :

* Hyperleukocytosis with PNN and increased CRP.
* If there is any doubt about an infectious origin: puncture and send the fluid for bacteriological analysis.
