Intense and/or repeated effort,

- Sports movements, often in untrained individuals.

- Carrying heavy loads (moving house), DIY (painting).

- Certain occupations (Table 57 occupational diseases).

'''Anatomical factors''' leading to mechanical friction of a tendon against a bony element (impingement): genu varum (windscreen wiper syndrome), exostosis, hip prosthesis with protrusion of the acetabular cup (impingement with the psoas), hooked acromion (subacromial impingement).

Smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.

Certain drugs: fluoroquinolones, corticosteroid injections, anabolics, statins.

'''Certain infections''': Lyme disease and other tick-borne infectious diseases, brucellosis.  


Trauma to a degenerative tendon can lead to tendon rupture.
