'''<u>Radiographs:</u>'''

*Indications: in trauma with sprains, X-rays have no diagnostic value, but they are requested in the presence of at least one of the Ottawa criteria (consensus conference 1995) in search of an associated injury or a differential diagnosis:
**age < 18 years or > 55 years
**6 centimetres of pain on palpation of the medial or lateral malleoli
**pain on palpation of the base of the 5th metatarsal or the navicular bone
**inability to take 4 steps with full weight-bearing
*Incidences:
**A frontal view of the ankle in 20Â° medial rotation, known as the "mortise" view.
**A lateral view of the ankle encompassing the calcaneus and the lateral Lisfranc joint.

'''<u>Echography:</u>''' enables ligament damage to be clearly visualised and a lesion assessment to be carried out, currently little used but of increasing indications especially to determine whether or not a rupture of the Achilles tendon is complete, or in cases of persistent pain after treatment for ankle sprains.

'''<u>Scanner:</u>''' if there is any doubt about a fracture that is difficult to visualise during a traumatic sprain mechanism (osteochondral fracture of the dome of the talus, fracture of the lateral tubercle of the talus).

MRI is not indicated in the acute phase, but can be used to carry out an exhaustive assessment of lesions in chronically painful ankles.
