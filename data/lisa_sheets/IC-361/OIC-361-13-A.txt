[https://videotheque.uness.fr/w/9EBd1shB32FtSmWXDM8mz2 A standard radiographic work-up is essential.

'''= Face in neutral rotation, internal rotation, external rotation and profile views'' (LAMY profile also known as scapula profile).

This radiographic assessment helps to rule out bone pathology (tumour) or joint pathology (primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis).

This radiographic assessment is used to look for indirect signs of conflict or injury to the cuff:

- '''condensation and geodes of the major tubercle'''

- condensation and acromial enthesopathy

- '''decreased subacromial space'''

- '''cephalic excentration and acromiohumeral neoarticulation''', '''omarthrosis secondary''' to a massive cuff tear with excentration of the humeral head

- '''calcification'''

- acromioclavicular osteoarthritis


This radiographic assessment may be supplemented by an ultrasound scan. This examination is used to detect :

           - '''un Ã©panchement'''

           - injury to the rotator cuff or other periscapular muscles

           - '''a pathology of the long portion of the biceps'''

However, this ultrasound work-up is not sufficient to establish an indication for surgery.


As a second-line treatment, this assessment should be supplemented by either:

- an arthroscanner

- MRI T2 fat sat and T1 sequences

- arthro-MRI
