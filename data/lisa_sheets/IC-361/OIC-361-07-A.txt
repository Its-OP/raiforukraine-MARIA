Rotator cuff tears can be of ''traumatic'', ''degenerative'' or ''mixed'' origin.

In "young subjects", these are usually "traumatic ruptures" following "falls onto the shoulder stump" or "abduction movements". The natural history of a cuff tear inevitably leads to tendon retraction and fatty muscle atrophy. In the long term, this can lead to secondary omarthrosis known as eccentric omarthrosis.

Assessment of the rupture by imaging is essential in order to propose an appropriate therapeutic strategy.

For young subjects aged 50 or under, ''rapid surgical repair'' is logical and desirable.
