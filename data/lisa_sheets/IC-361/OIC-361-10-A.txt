'''<u>Injury to the central pivot:</u>''''

*The interview looks for
**the existence of an orthopaedic history of the knee
**whether the problems are recent (traumatic) or chronic
**slippage: a feeling of the knee dropping and of insecurity (the patient may mention dislocations, dislocations or jerks), either when doing sport and/or in daily life (stairs). Their frequency and intensity are important factors in assessing instability and functional discomfort. This is a major sign of poor tolerance of ligament damage, which may lead to an indication for ligamentoplasty.
**the occurrence of knee effusion (acute: haemarthrosis) or chronic effusion on exertion or spontaneously
**description of any pain: triggering factors, intensity, location of pain, by asking the patient to point to the painful spot(s) with a finger.
*Inspection will look for :
**a knee effusion, by looking for patellar shock.
**swelling of the anterior tibial tuberosity on a knee bent at 70° to the contralateral side, indicating chronic PCL injury.
*The physical examination must test all the ligaments, after checking acutely that there is no bone damage, using X-rays of the front and side of the knee, before any ligament testing. It must always be comparative and bilateral.
**Lachman's test: with the knee bent at 20°, the tibia is pulled anteriorly. A rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament results in an anterior drawer movement without any sensation of a true stop (soft stop). A sensation of an anterior drawer with a hard stop may indicate the reduction of a posterior drawer in the context of a posterior cruciate lesion.
**the search for a rotatory snap (pivot-shift test for ACL damage): in the starting position, the patient is supine, knee in extension + valgus, leg in internal rotation. The examiner then gradually flexes the knee, while maintaining valgus and internal rotation. In the event of an ACL rupture, the lateral tibial plateau is subluxed forward in the starting position, then reduces during flexion, giving a protrusion. The patient also feels this protrusion, which reminds him of his slipping (slipping is the symptom described by the patient, instability is the clinical sign observed by the doctor).
**looking for swelling of the anterior tibial tuberosity: on a knee in 70° flexion, the tibia on the injured side (PCL) spontaneously moves into a posterior drawer, the tibial tuberosity does not protrude as it does on the healthy side.
**looking for asymmetric hyperextension: the leg is lifted bilaterally by the big toe and we look for asymmetric hyperextension, which indicates damage to the condylar shells. When it is also associated with external hyperrotation, it indicates damage to the PCL and the posterolateral plane (Hughston's sign).

'''<u>Meniscal lesions:</u>''''

*The history-taking will look for :
**the existence of an orthopaedic history (sprain, fracture) of the knee or a rheumatological history
**whether the onset of pain is gradual or sudden
**the type of pain: it is most often mechanical, daytime pain that occurs when walking or exercising
**the association with a knee effusion described as swelling of the knee on exertion
**description of the site of the pain, with the patient pointing to the inside of the knee or its posteromedial part
**the description of a sudden pain occurring when rising from a squatting position, or during a twisting movement under load, associated with a clinical blockage of extension (flexion of the knee possible but extension impossible) is pathognomonic of a meniscal blockage.
*Inspection will look for :
**knee effusion, by looking for patellar shock
**persistent moderate knee flaccidity
**in some chronic cases, moderate quadriceps amyotrophy
**in the case of a meniscal cyst, there may be visible swelling on the knee joint space
*The physical examination looks for :
**a painful limitation of mobility, particularly in flexion: asymmetric flaccidity when lying prone (GENETY's sign) is suggestive
**Palpation of the joint space, looking for pain, particularly in the posteromedial part of the knee.
**the presence of a Grinding-test: with the patient in prone position, on the knee bent at 90°, the examiner applies axial pressure in the axis of the tibia associated with movements of external rotation of the foot. The onset of pain in the medial region of the knee suggests a meniscal lesion.
**Mac-Murray's sign: this is a perceived protrusion, associated with pain during a combined movement of forced flexion associated with rotational manoeuvres in the supine position.
**The knee must be thoroughly examined to detect any associated ligament and/or patellofemoral injury.
